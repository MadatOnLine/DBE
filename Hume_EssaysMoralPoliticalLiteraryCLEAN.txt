therefore shall be short it may be thought an instance of vanity that pretend at all to write my life but this narrative shall contain little more than the history of my writings as indeed almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations the first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of vanity was born the th of april old style at edinburgh was of a good family both by father and mother my fathers family is a branch of the earl of homes or humes and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate which my brother possesses for several generations my mother was daughter of sir david falconer president of the college of justice the title of lord halkerton came by succession to her brother my family however was not rich and being myself a younger brother my patrimony according to the mode of my country was of course very slender my father who passed for a man of parts died when was an infant leaving me with an elder brother and a sister under the care of our mother a woman of singular merit who though young and handsome devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children passed through the ordinary course of education with success and was seized very early with a passion for literature which has been the ruling passion of my life and the great source of my enjoyments my studious disposition my sobriety and my industry gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me but found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning and while they fancied was poring upon voet and vinnius cicero and virgil were the authors which was secretly devouring my very slender fortune however being unsuitable to this plan of life and my health being a little broken by my ardent application was tempted or rather forced to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life in went to bristol with some recommendations to eminent merchants but in a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me went over to france with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat and there laid that plan of life which have steadily and successfully pursued resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune to maintain unimpaired my independency and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvement of my talents in literature during my retreat in france first at reims but chiefly at la fleche in anjou composed my treatise of human nature after passing three years very agreeably in that country came over to london in in the end of published my treatise and immediately went down to my mother and my brother who lived at his countryhouse and was employing himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my treatise of human nature it fell deadborn from the press without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots but being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper very soon recovered the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country in printed at edinburgh the first part of my essays the work was favourably received and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment continued with my mother and brother in the country and in that time recovered the knowledge of the greek language which had too much neglected in my early youth in received a letter from the marquis of annandale inviting me to come and live with him in england found also that the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction for the state of his mind and health required iti lived with him a twelvemonth my appointments during that time made a considerable accession to my small fortune then received an invitation from general st clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition which was at first meant against canada but ended in an incursion on the coast of france next year to wit received an invitation from the general to attend him in the same station in his military embassy to the courts of vienna and turin then wore the uniform of an officer and was introduced at these courts as aiddecamp to the general along with sir harry erskine and captain grant now general grant these two years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during the course of my life passed them agreeably and in good company and my appointments with my frugality had made me reach a fortune which called independent though most of my friends were inclined to smile when said so in short was now master of near a thousand pounds had always entertained a notion that my want of success in publishing the treatise of human nature had proceeded more from the manner than the matter and that had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion in going to the press too early therefore cast the first part of that work anew in the enquiry concerning human understanding which was published while was at turin but this piece was at first little more successful than the treatise of human nature on my return from italy had the mortification to find all england in a ferment on account of dr middletons free enquiry while my performance was entirely overlooked and neglected a new edition which had been published at london of my essays moral and political met not with a much better reception such is the force of natural temper that these disappointments made little or no impression on me went down in and lived two years with my brother at his countryhouse for my mother was now dead there composed the second part of my essays which called political discourses and also my enquiry concerning the principles of morals which is another part of my treatise that cast anew meanwhile my bookseller a millar informed me that my former publications all but the unfortunate treatise were beginning to be the subject of conversation that the sale of them was gradually increasing and that new editions were demanded answers by reverends and right reverends came out two or three in a year and found by dr warburtons railing that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company however had fixed a resolution which inflexibly maintained never to reply to any body and not being very irascible in my temper have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles these symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement as was ever more disposed to see the favourable than unfavourable side of things a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year in removed from the country to the town the true scene for a man of letters in were published at edinburgh where then lived my political discourses the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication it was well received abroad and at home in the same year was published at london my enquiry concerning the principles of morals which in my own opinion who ought not to judge on that subject is of all my writings historical philosophical or literary incomparably the best it came unnoticed and unobserved into the world in the faculty of advocates chose me their librarian an office from which received little or no emolument but which gave me the command of a large library then formed the plan of writing the history of england but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of years commenced with the accession of the house of stuart an epoch when thought the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place was own sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work thought that was the only historian that had at once neglected present power interest and authority and the cry of popular prejudices and as the subject was suited to every capacity expected proportional applause but miserable was my disappointment was assailed by one cry of reproach disapprobation and even detestation english scotch and irish whig and tory churchman and sectary freethinker and religionist patriot and courtier united in their rage against the man who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of charles and the earl of strafford and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over what was still more mortifying the book seemed to sink into oblivion mr millar told me that in a twelvemonth he sold only fortyfive copies of it scarcely indeed heard of one man in the three kingdoms considerable for rank or letters that could endure the book must only except the primate of england dr herring and the primate of ireland dr stone which seem two odd exceptions these dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged was however confess discouraged and had not the war been at that time breaking out between france and england had certainly retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom have changed my name and never more have returned to my native country but as this scheme was not now practicable and the subsequent volume was considerably advanced resolved to pick up courage and to persevere in this interval published at london my natural history of religion along with some other small pieces its public entry was rather obscure except only that dr hurd wrote a pamphlet against it with all the illiberal petulance arrogance and scurrility which distinguish the warburtonian school this pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance in two years after the fall of the first volume was published the second volume of my history containing the period from the death of charles till the revolution this performance happened to give less displeasure to the whigs and was better received it not only rose itself but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother but though had been taught by experience that the whig party were in possession of bestowing all places both in the state and in literature was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour that in above a hundred alterations which farther study reading or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first stuarts have made all of them invariably to the tory side it is ridiculous to consider the english constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty in published my history of the house of tudor the clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against the history of the two first stuarts the reign of elizabeth was particularly obnoxious but was now callous against the impressions of public folly and continued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at edinburgh to finish in two volumes the more early part of the english history which gave to the public in with tolerable and but tolerable success but notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons to which my writings had been exposed they had still been making such advances that the copymoney given me by the booksellers much exceeded any thing formerly known in england was become not only independent but opulent retired to my native country of scotland determined never more to set my foot out of it and retaining the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to one great man or even making advances of friendship to any of them as was now turned of fifty thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner when received in an invitation from the earl of hertford with whom was not in the least acquainted to attend him on his embassy to paris with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy and in the meanwhile of performing the functions of that office this offer however inviting at first declined both because was reluctant to begin connexions with the great and because was afraid that the civilities and gay company of paris would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humour but on his lordships repeating the invitation accepted of it have every reason both of pleasure and interest to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman as well as afterwards with his brother general conway those who have not seen the strange effects of modes will never imagine the reception met with at paris from men and women of all ranks and stations the more resiled from their excessive civilities the more was loaded with them there is however a real satisfaction in living at paris from the great number of sensible knowing and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the universe thought once of settling there for life was appointed secretary to the embassy and in summer lord hertford left me being appointed lord lieutenant of ireland was chargé daffaires till the arrival of the duke of richmond towards the end of the year in the beginning of left paris and next summer went to edinburgh with the same view as formerly of burying myself in a philosophical retreat returned to that place not richer but with much more money and a much larger income by means of lord hertfords friendship than left it and was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce as had formerly made an experiment of a competency but in received from mr conway an invitation to be undersecretary and this invitation both the character of the person and my connexions with lord hertford prevented me from declining returned to edinburgh in very opulent for possessed a revenue of l a year healthy and though somewhat stricken in years with the prospect of enjoying long my ease and of seeing the increase of my reputation in spring was struck with a disorder in my bowels which at first gave me no alarm but has since as apprehend it become mortal and incurable now reckon upon a speedy dissolution have suffered very little pain from my disorder and what is more strange have notwithstanding the great decline of my person never suffered a moments abatement of my spirits insomuch that were to name the period of my life which should most choose to pass over again might be tempted to point to this later period possess the same ardour as ever in study and the same gaiety in company consider besides that a man of sixtyfive by dying cuts off only a few years of infirmities and though see many symptoms of my literary reputations breaking out at last with additional lustre knew that could have but few years to enjoy it it is difficult to be more detached from life than am at present to conclude historically with my own character am or rather was for that is the style must now use in speaking of myself which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments was say a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humour capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions even my love of literary fame my ruling passion never soured my temper notwithstanding my frequent disappointments my company was not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary and as took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women had no reason to be displeased with the reception met with from them in a word though most men any wise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny never was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth and though wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury my friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots we may well suppose would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained april letter from adam smith to william strahan esq kirkaldy fifeshire nov dear sir it is with a real though a very melancholy pleasure that sit down to give you some account of the behaviour of our late excellent friend mr hume during his last illness though in his own judgment his disease was mortal and incurable yet he allowed himself to be prevailed upon by the entreaty of his friends to try what might be the effects of a long journey a few days before he set out he wrote that account of his own life which together with his other papers he has left to your care my account therefore shall begin where his ends he set out for london towards the end of april and at morpeth met with mr john home and myself who had both come down from london on purpose to see him expecting to have found him at edinburgh mr home returned with him and attended him during the whole of his stay in england with that care and attention which might be expected from a temper so perfectly friendly and affectionate as had written to my mother that she might expect me in scotland was under the necessity of continuing my journey his disease seemed to yield to exercise and change of air and when he arrived in london he was apparently in much better health than when he left edinburgh he was advised to go to bath to drink the waters which appeared for some time to have so good an effect upon him that even he himself began to entertain what he was not apt to do a better opinion of his own health his symptoms however soon returned with their usual violence and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery but submitted with the utmost cheerfulness and the most perfect complacency and resignation upon his return to edinburgh though he found himself much weaker yet his cheerfulness never abated and he continued to divert himself as usual with correcting his own works for a new edition with reading books of amusement with the conversation of his friends and sometimes in the evening with a party at his favourite game of whist his cheerfulness was so great and his conversation and amusements run so much in their usual strain that notwithstanding all bad symptoms many people could not believe he was dying shall tell your friend colonel edmondstone said doctor dundas to him one day that left you much better and in a fair way of recovery doctor said he as believe you would not chuse to tell any thing but the truth you had better tell him that am dying as fast as my enemies if have any could wish and as easily and cheerfully as my best friends could desire colonel edmondstone soon afterwards came to see him and take leave of him and on his way home he could not forbear writing him a letter bidding him once more an eternal adieu and applying to him as to a dying man the beautiful french verses in which the abbé chaulieu in expectation of his own death laments his approaching separation from his friend the marquis de la fare mr humes magnanimity and firmness were such that his most affectionate friends knew that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man and that so far from being hurt by this frankness he was rather pleased and flattered by it happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter which he had just received and which he immediately showed me told him that though was sensible how very much he was weakened and that appearances were in many respects very bad yet his cheerfulness was still so great the spirit of life seemed still to be so very strong in him that could not help entertaining some faint hopes he answered your hopes are groundless an habitual diarrhoea of more than a years standing would be a very bad disease at any age at my age it is a mortal one when lie down in the evening feel myself weaker than when rose in the morning and when rise in the morning weaker than when lay down in the evening am sensible besides that some of my vital parts are affected so that must soon die well said if it must be so you have at least the satisfaction of leaving all your friends your brothers family in particular in great prosperity he said that he felt that satisfaction so sensibly that when he was reading a few days before lucians dialogues of the dead among all the excuses which are alleged to charon for not entering readily into his boat he could not find one that fitted him he had no house to finish he had no daughter to provide for he had no enemies upon whom he wished to revenge himself could not well imagine said he what excuse could make to charon in order to obtain a little delay have done every thing of consequence which ever meant to do and could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in a better situation than that in which am now likely to leave them therefore have all reason to die contented he then diverted himself with inventing several jocular excuses which he supposed he might make to charon and with imagining the very surly answers which it might suit the character of charon to return to them upon further consideration said he thought might say to him good charon have been correcting my works for a new edition allow me a little time that may see how the public receives the alterations but charon would answer when you have seen the effect of these you will be for making other alterations there will be no end of such excuses so honest friend please step into the boat but might still urge have a little patience good charon have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public if live a few years longer may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfal of some of the prevailing systems of superstition but charon would then lose all temper and decency you loitering rogue that will not happen these many hundred years do you fancy will grant you a lease for so long a term get into the boat this instant you lazy loitering rogue but though mr hume always talked of his approaching dissolution with great cheerfulness he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity he never mentioned the subject but when the conversation naturally led to it and never dwelt longer upon it than the course of the conversation happened to require it was a subject indeed which occurred pretty frequently in consequence of the inquiries which his friends who came to see him naturally made concerning the state of his health the conversation which mentioned above and which passed on thursday the th of august was the last except one that ever had with him he had now become so very weak that the company of his most intimate friends fatigued him for his cheerfulness was still so great his complaisance and social disposition were still so entire that when any friend was with him he could not help talking more and with greater exertion than suited the weakness of his body at his own desire therefore agreed to leave edinburgh where was staying partly upon his account and returned to my mothers house here at kirkaldy upon condition that he would send for me whenever he wished to see me the physician who saw him most frequently doctor black undertaking in the mean time to write me occasionally an account of the state of his health on the d of august the doctor wrote me the following letter since my last mr hume has passed his time pretty easily but is much weaker he sits up goes down stairs once a day and amuses himself with reading but seldom sees any body he finds that even the conversation of his most intimate friends fatigues and oppresses him and it is happy that he does not need it for he is quite free from anxiety impatience or low spirits and passes his time very well with the assistance of amusing books received the day after a letter from mr hume himself of which the following is an extract edinburgh d august my dearest friend am obliged to make use of my nephews hand in writing to you as do not rise today go very fast to decline and last night had a small fever which hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious illness but unluckily it has in a great measure gone off cannot submit to your coming over here on my account as it is possible for me to see you so small a part of the day but doctor black can better inform you concerning the degree of strength which may from time to time remain with me adieu c three days after received the following letter from doctor black edinburgh monday th august dear sir yesterday about four oclock afternoon mr hume expired the near approach of his death became evident in the night between thursday and friday when his disease became excessive and soon weakened him so much that he could no longer rise out of his bed he continued to the last perfectly sensible and free from much pain or feelings of distress he never dropped the smallest expression of impatience but when he had occasion to speak to the people about him always did it with affection and tenderness thought it improper to write to bring you over especially as heard that he had dictated a letter to you desiring you not to come when he became very weak it cost him an effort to speak and he died in such a happy composure of mind that nothing could exceed it thus died our most excellent and never to be forgotten friend concerning whose philosophical opinions men will no doubt judge variously every one approving or condemning them according as they happen to coincide or disagree with his own but concerning whose character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion his temper indeed seemed to be more happily balanced if may be allowed such an expression than that perhaps of any other man have ever known even in the lowest state of his fortune his great and necessary frugality never hindered him from exercising upon proper occasions acts both of charity and generosity it was a frugality founded not upon avarice but upon the love of independency the extreme gentleness of his nature never weakened either the firmness of his mind or the steadiness of his resolutions his constant pleasantry was the genuine effusion of goodnature and goodhumour tempered with delicacy and modesty and without even the slightest tincture of malignity so frequently the disagreeable source of what is called wit in other men it never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify and therefore far from offending it seldom failed to please and delight even those who were the objects of it to his friends who were frequently the objects of it there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable qualities which contributed more to endear his conversation and that gaiety of temper so agreeable in society but which is so often accompanied with frivolous and superficial qualities was in him certainly attended with the most severe application the most extensive learning the greatest depth of thought and a capacity in every respect the most comprehensive upon the whole have always considered him both in his lifetime and since his death as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit ever am dear sir most affectionately yours adam smith essays and treatises on several subjects in two volumes by david hume esq vol containing essays moral political and literary a new edition london printed for t cadell in the strand and a donaldson and w creech at edinburgh essays moral political and literary part part essays moral political and literary essay of the delicacy of taste and passion some people are subject to a certain delicacy of passion which makes them extremely sensible to all the accidents of life and gives them a lively joy upon every prosperous event as well as a piercing grief when they meet with misfortunes and adversity favours and good offices easily engage their friendship while the smallest injury provokes their resentment any honour or mark of distinction elevates them above measure but they are as sensibly touched with contempt people of this character have no doubt more lively enjoyments as well as more pungent sorrows than men of cool and sedate tempers but believe when every thing is balanced there is no one who would not rather be of the latter character were he entirely master of his own disposition good or ill fortune is very little at our disposal and when a person that has this sensibility of temper meets with any misfortune his sorrow or resentment takes entire possession of him and deprives him of all relish in the common occurrences of life the right enjoyment of which forms the chief part of our happiness great pleasures are much less frequent than great pains so that a sensible temper must meet with fewer trials in the former way than in the latter not to mention that men of such lively passions are apt to be transported beyond all bounds of prudence and discretion and to take false steps in the conduct of life which are often irretrievable there is a delicacy of taste observable in some men which very much resembles this delicacy of passion and produces the same sensibility to beauty and deformity of every kind as that does to prosperity and adversity obligations and injuries when you present a poem or a picture to a man possessed of this talent the delicacy of his feeling makes him be sensibly touched with every part of it nor are the masterly strokes perceived with more exquisite relish and satisfaction than the negligences or absurdities with disgust and uneasiness a polite and judicious conversation affords him the highest entertainment rudeness or impertinence is as great a punishment to him in short delicacy of taste has the same effect as delicacy of passion it enlarges the sphere both of our happiness and misery and makes us sensible to pains as well as pleasures which escape the rest of mankind believe however every one will agree with me that notwithstanding this resemblance delicacy of taste is as much to be desired and cultivated as delicacy of passion is to be lamented and to be remedied if possible the good or ill accidents of life are very little at our disposal but we are pretty much masters what books we shall read what diversions we shall partake of and what company we shall keep philosophers have endeavoured to render happiness entirely independent of every thing external that degree of perfection is impossible to be attained but every wise man will endeavour to place his happiness on such objects chiefly as depend upon himself and that is not to be attained so much by any other means as by this delicacy of sentiment when a man is possessed of that talent he is more happy by what pleases his taste than by what gratifies his appetites and receives more enjoyment from a poem or a piece of reasoning than the most expensive luxury can afforda whatever connection there may be originally between these two species of delicacy am persuaded that nothing is so proper to cure us of this delicacy of passion as the cultivating of that higher and more refined taste which enables us to judge of the characters of men of compositions of genius and of the productions of the nobler arts a greater or less relish for those obvious beauties which strike the senses depends entirely upon the greater or less sensibility of the temper but with regard to the sciences and liberal arts a fine taste is in some measure the same with strong sense or at least depends so much upon it that they are inseparable in order to judge aright of a composition of genius there are so many views to be taken in so many circumstances to be compared and such a knowledge of human nature requisite that no man who is not possessed of the soundest judgment will ever make a tolerable critic in such performances and this is a new reason for cultivating a relish in the liberal arts our judgment will strengthen by this exercise we shall form juster notions of life many things which please or afflict others will appear to us too frivolous to engage our attention and we shall lose by degrees that sensibility and delicacy of passion which is so incommodious but perhaps have gone too far in saying that a cultivated taste for the polite arts extinguishes the passions and renders us indifferent to those objects which are so fondly pursued by the rest of mankind on farther reflection find that it rather improves our sensibility for all the tender and agreeable passions at the same time that it renders the mind incapable of the rougher and more boisterous emotions ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollit mores nec sinit esse feros for this think there may be assigned two very natural reasons in the first place nothing is so improving to the temper as the study of the beauties either of poetry eloquence music or painting they give a certain elegance of sentiment to which the rest of mankind are strangers the emotions which they excite are soft and tender they draw off the mind from the hurry of business and interest cherish reflection dispose to tranquillity and produce an agreeable melancholy which of all dispositions of the mind is the best suited to love and friendship in the second place a delicacy of taste is favourable to love and friendship by confining our choice to few people and making us indifferent to the company and conversation of the greater part of men you will seldom find that mere men of the world whatever strong sense they may be endowed with are very nice in distinguishing characters or in marking those insensible differences and gradations which make one man preferable to another any one that has competent sense is sufficient for their entertainment they talk to him of their pleasure and affairs with the same frankness that they would to another and finding many who are fit to supply his place they never feel any vacancy or want in his absence but to make use of the allusion of a celebrated french author the judgment may be compared to a clock or watch where the most ordinary machine is sufficient to tell the hours but the most elaborate alone can point out the minutes and seconds and distinguish the smallest differences of time one that has well digested his knowledge both of books and men has little enjoyment but in the company of a few select companions he feels too sensibly how much all the rest of mankind fall short of the notions which he has entertained and his affections being thus confined within a narrow circle no wonder he carries them further than if they were more general and undistinguished the gaiety and frolic of a bottle companion improves with him into a solid friendship and the ardours of a youthful appetite become an elegant passion essay of the liberty of the press nothing is more apt to surprise a foreigner than the extreme liberty which we enjoy in this country of communicating whatever we please to the public and of openly censuring every measure entered into by the king or his ministers if the administration resolve upon war it is affirmed that either wilfully or ignorantly they mistake the interests of the nation and that peace in the present situation of affairs is infinitely preferable if the passion of the ministers lie towards peace our political writers breathe nothing but war and devastation and represent the pacific conduct of the government as mean and pusillanimous as this liberty is not indulged in any other government either republican or monarchical in holland and venice more than in france or spain it may very naturally give occasion to a question how it happens thatgreat britainalone enjoys this peculiar privilegea the reason why the laws indulge us in such a liberty seems to be derived from our mixed form of government which is neither wholly monarchical nor wholly republican it will be found if mistake not a true observation in politics that the two extremes in government liberty and slavery commonly approach nearest to each other and that as you depart from the extremes and mix a little of monarchy with liberty the government becomes always the more free and on the other hand when you mix a little of liberty with monarchy the yoke becomes always the more grievous and intolerableb in a government such as that of france which is absolute and where law custom and religion concur all of them to make the people fully satisfied with their condition the monarch cannot entertain any jealousy against his subjects and therefore is apt to indulge them in great liberties both of speech and action in a government altogether republican such as that of holland where there is no magistrate so eminent as to give jealousy to the state there is no danger in intrusting the magistrates with large discretionary powers and though many advantages result from such powers in preserving peace and order yet they lay a considerable restraint on mens actions and make every private citizen pay a great respect to the government thus it seems evident that the two extremes of absolute monarchy and of a republic approach near to each other in some material circumstances in the first the magistrate has no jealousy of the people in the second the people have none of the magistrate which want of jealousy begets a mutual confidence and trust in both cases and produces a species of liberty in monarchies and of arbitrary power in republics to justify the other part of the foregoing observation that in every government the means are most wide of each other and that the mixtures of monarchy and liberty render the yoke either more easy or more grievous must take notice of a remark in tacitus with regard to the romans under the emperors that they neither could bear total slavery nor total liberty nec totam servitutem nec totam libertatem pati possunt this remark a celebrated poet has translated and applied to the english in his lively description of queen elizabeths policy and government et fit aimer son joug a langlois indompté qui ne peut ni servir ni vivre en liberté henriade liv according to these remarks we are to consider the roman government under the emperors as a mixture of despotism and liberty where the despotism prevailed and the english government as a mixture of the same kind where the liberty predominates the consequences are conformable to the foregoing observation and such as may be expected from those mixed forms of government which beget a mutual watchfulness and jealousy the roman emperors were many of them the most frightful tyrants that ever disgraced human nature and it is evident that their cruelty was chiefly excited by their jealousy and by their observing that all the great men of rome bore with impatience the dominion of a family which but a little before was no wise superior to their own on the other hand as the republican part of the government prevails in england though with a great mixture of monarchy it is obliged for its own preservation to maintain a watchful jealousy over the magistrates to remove all discretionary powers and to secure every ones life and fortune by general and inflexible laws no action must be deemed a crime but what the law has plainly determined to be such no crime must be imputed to a man but from a legal proof before his judges and even these judges must be his fellowsubjects who are obliged by their own interest to have a watchful eye over the encroachments and violence of the ministers from these causes it proceeds that there is as much liberty and even perhaps licentiousness in great britain as there were formerly slavery and tyranny in rome these principles account for the great liberty of the press in these kingdoms beyond what is indulged in any other governmentc it is apprehended that arbitrary power would steal in upon us were we not careful to prevent its progress and were there not an easy method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other the spirit of the people must frequently be rouzed in order to curb the ambition of the court and the dread of rouzing this spirit must be employed to prevent that ambition nothing so effectual to this purpose as the liberty of the press by which all the learning wit and genius of the nation may be employed on the side of freedom and every one be animated to its defence as long therefore as the republican part of our government can maintain itself against the monarchical it will naturally be careful to keep the press open as of importance to its own preservation it must however be allowed that the unbounded liberty of the press though it be difficult perhaps impossible to propose a suitable remedy for it is one of the evils attending those mixt forms of governmentd essay that politics may be reduced to a science it is a question with several whether there be any essential difference between one form of government and another and whether every form may not become good or bad according as it is well or ill administered were it once admitted that all governments are alike and that the only difference consists in the character and conduct of the governors most political disputes would be at an end and all zeal for one constitution above another must be esteemed mere bigotry and folly but though a friend to moderation cannot forbear condemning this sentiment and should be sorry to think that human affairs admit of no greater stability than what they receive from the casual humours and characters of particular men it is true those who maintain that the goodness of all government consists in the goodness of the administration may cite many particular instances in history where the very same government in different hands has varied suddenly into the two opposite extremes of good and bad compare the french government under henry and under henry oppression levityartifice on the part of the rulers faction sedition treachery rebellion disloyalty on the part of the subjects these compose the character of the former miserable æra but when the patriot and heroic prince who succeeded was once firmly seated on the throne the government the people every thing seemed to be totally changed and all from the difference of the temper and conduct of these two sovereignsa instances of this kind may be multiplied almost without number from ancient as well as modern history foreign as well as domestic but here it may be proper to make a distinction all absolute governmentsb must very much depend on the administration and this is one of the great inconveniences attending that form of government but a republican and free government would be an obvious absurdity if the particular checks and controuls provided by the constitution had really no influence and made it not the interest even of bad men to act for the public good such is the intention of these forms of government and such is their real effect where they are wisely constituted as on the other hand they are the source of all disorder and of the blackest crimes where either skill or honesty has been wanting in their original frame and institution so great is the force of laws and of particular forms of government and so little dependence have they on the humours and tempers of men that consequences almost as general and certain may sometimes be deduced from them as any which the mathematical sciences afford us the constitution of the roman republic gave the whole legislative power to the people without allowing a negative voice either to the nobility or consuls this unbounded power they possessed in a collective not in a representative body the consequences were when the people by success and conquest had become very numerous and had spread themselves to a great distance from the capital the citytribes though the most contemptible carried almost every vote they were therefore most cajoled by every one that affected popularity they were supported in idleness by the general distribution of corn and by particular bribes which they received from almost every candidate by this means they became every day more licentious and the campus martius was a perpetual scene of tumult and sedition armed slaves were introduced among these rascally citizens so that the whole government fell into anarchy and the greatest happiness which the romans could look for was the despotic power of the cæsars such are the effects of democracy without a representative a nobility may possess the whole or any part of the legislative power of a state in two different ways either every nobleman shares the power as part of the whole body or the whole body enjoys the power as composed of parts which have each a distinct power and authority the venetian aristocracy is an instance of the first kind of government the polish of the second in the venetian government the whole body of nobility possesses the whole power and no nobleman has any authority which he receives not from the whole in the polish government every nobleman by means of his fiefs has a distinct hereditary authority over his vassals and the whole body has no authority but what it receives from the concurrence of its parts the different operations and tendencies of these two species of government might be made apparent even a priori a venetian nobility is preferable to a polish let the humours and education of men be ever so much varied a nobility who possess their power in common will preserve peace and order both among themselves and their subjects and no member can have authority enough to controul the laws for a moment the nobles will preserve their authority over the people but without any grievous tyranny or any breach of private property because such a tyrannical government promotes not the interests of the whole body however it may that of some individuals there will be a distinction of rank between the nobility and people but this will be the only distinction in the state the whole nobility will form one body and the whole people another without any of those private feuds and animosities which spread ruin and desolation every where it is easy to see the disadvantages of a polish nobility in every one of these particulars it is possible so to constitute a free government as that a single person call him doge prince or king shall possess a large share of power and shall form a proper balance or counterpoise to the other parts of the legislature this chief magistrate may be either elective or hereditary and though the former institution may to a superficial view appear the most advantageous yet a more accurate inspection will discover in it greater inconveniencies than in the latter and such as are founded on causes and principles eternal and immutable the filling of the throne in such a government is a point of too great and too general interest not to divide the whole people into factions whence a civil war the greatest of ills may be apprehended almost with certainty upon every vacancy the prince elected must be either a foreigner or a native the former will be ignorant of the people whom he is to govern suspicious of his new subjects and suspected by them giving his confidence entirely to strangers who will have no other care but of enriching themselves in the quickest manner while their masters favour and authority are able to support them a native will carry into the throne all his private animosities and friendships and will never be viewed in his elevation without exciting the sentiment of envy in those who formerly considered him as their equal not to mention that a crown is too high a reward ever to be given to merit alone and will always induce the candidates to employ force or money or intrigue to procure the votes of the electors so that such an election will give no better chance for superior merit in the prince than if the state had trusted to birth alone for determining their sovereign it may therefore be pronounced as an universal axiom in politics that an hereditary prince a nobility without vassals and a people voting by their representatives form the bestmonarchy aristocracy anddemocracy but in order to prove more fully that politics admit of general truths which are invariable by the humour or education either of subject or sovereign it may not be amiss to observe some other principles of this science which may seem to deserve that character it may easily be observed that though free governments have been commonly the most happy for those who partake of their freedom yet are they the most ruinous and oppressive to their provinces and this observation may believe be fixed as a maxim of the kind we are here speaking of when a monarch extends his dominions by conquest he soon learns to consider his old and his new subjects as on the same footing because in reality all his subjects are to him the same except the few friends and favourites with whom he is personally acquainted he does not therefore make any distinction between them in his general laws and at the same time is careful to prevent all particular acts of oppression on the one as well as on the other but a free state necessarily makes a great distinction and must always do so till men learn to love their neighbours as well as themselves the conquerors in such a government are all legislators and will be sure to contrive matters by restrictions on trade and by taxes so as to draw some private as well as public advantage from their conquests provincial governors have also a better chance in a republic to escape with their plunder by means of bribery or intrigue and their fellowcitizens who find their own state to be enriched by the spoils of the subject provinces will be the more inclined to tolerate such abuses not to mention that it is a necessary precaution in a free state to change the governors frequently which obliges these temporary tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious that they may accumulate sufficient wealth before they give place to their successors what cruel tyrants were the romans over the world during the time of their commonwealth it is true they had laws to prevent oppression in their provincial magistrates but cicero informs us that the romans could not better consult the interests of the provinces than by repealing these very laws for in that case says he our magistrates having entire impunity would plunder no more than would satisfy their own rapaciousness whereas at present they must also satisfy that of their judges and of all the great men in rome of whose protection they stand in need who can read of the cruelties and oppressions of verres without horror and astonishment and who is not touched with indignation to hear that after cicero had exhausted on that abandoned criminal all the thunders of his eloquence and had prevailed so far as to get him condemned to the utmost extent of the laws yet that cruel tyrant lived peaceably to old age in opulence and ease and thirty years afterwards was put into the proscription by mark anthony on account of his exorbitant wealth where he fell with cicero himself and all the most virtuous men of rome after the dissolution of the commonwealth the roman yoke became easier upon the provinces as tacitus informs us and it may be observed that many of the worst emperors domitian for instance were careful to prevent all oppression on the provinces intiberiuss time gaul was esteemed richer than italy itself nor do find during the whole time of the roman monarchy that the empire became less rich or populous in any of its provinces though indeed its valour and military discipline were always upon the decline the oppression and tyranny of the carthaginians over their subject states in africa went so far as we learn from polybius that not content with exacting the half of all the produce of the land which of itself was a very high rent they also loaded them with many other taxesd if we pass from ancient to modern times we shall still find the observation to hold the provinces of absolute monarchies are always better treated than those of free states compare the païs conquis of france with ireland and you will be convinced of this truth though this latter kingdom being in a good measure peopled from england possesses so many rights and privileges as should naturally make it challenge better treatment than that of a conquered province corsica is also an obvious instance to the same purpose there is an observation in machiavel with regard to the conquests of alexander the great which think may be regarded as one of those eternal political truths which no time nor accidents can vary it may seem strange says that politician that such sudden conquests as those of alexander should be possessed so peaceably by his successors and that the persians during all the confusions and civil wars among the greeks never made the smallest effort towards the recovery of their former independent government to satisfy us concerning the cause of this remarkable event we may consider that a monarch may govern his subjects in two different ways he may either follow the maxims of the eastern princes and stretch his authority so far as to leave no distinction of rank among his subjects but what proceeds immediately from himself no advantages of birth no hereditary honours and possessions and in a word no credit among the people except from his commission alone or a monarch may exert his power after a milder manner like other european princes and leave other sources of honour beside his smile and favour birth titles possessions valour integrity knowledge or great and fortunate atchievements in the former species of government after a conquest it is impossible ever to shake off the yoke since no one possesses among the people so much personal credit and authority as to begin such an enterprize whereas in the latter the least misfortune or discord among the victors will encourage the vanquished to take arms who have leaders ready to prompt and conduct them in every undertaking such is the reasoning of machiavel which seems solid and conclusive though wish he had not mixed falsehood with truth in asserting that monarchies governed according to eastern policy though more easily kept when once subdued yet are the most difficult to subdue since they cannot contain any powerful subject whose discontent and faction may facilitate the enterprizes of an enemy for besides that such a tyrannical government enervates the courage of men and renders them indifferent towards the fortunes of their sovereign besides this say we find by experience that even the temporary and delegated authority of the generals and magistrates being always in such governments as absolute within its sphere as that of the prince himself is able with barbarians accustomed to a blind submission to produce the most dangerous and fatal revolutions so that in every respect a gentle government is preferable and gives the greatest security to the sovereign as well as to the subject legislators therefore ought not to trust the future government of a state entirely to chance but ought to provide a system of laws to regulate the administration of public affairs to the latest posterity effects will always correspond to causes and wise regulations in any commonwealth are the most valuable legacy that can be left to future ages in the smallest court or office the stated forms and methods by which business must be conducted are found to be a considerable check on the natural depravity of mankind why should not the case be the same in public affairs can we ascribe the stability and wisdom of the venetian government through so many ages to any thing but the form of government and is it not easy to point out those defects in the original constitution which produced the tumultuous governments of athens and rome and ended at last in the ruin of these two famous republics and so little dependance has this affair on the humours and education of particular men that one part of the same republic may be wisely conducted and another weakly by the very same men merely on account of the difference of the forms and institutions by which these parts are regulated historians inform us that this was actually the case with genoa for while the state was always full of sedition and tumult and disorder the bank of st george which had become a considerable part of the people was conducted for several ages with the utmost integrity and wisdom the ages of greatest public spirit are not always most eminent for private virtue good laws may beget order and moderation in the government where the manners and customs have instilled little humanity or justice into the tempers of men the most illustrious period of the roman history considered in a political view is that between the beginning of the first and end of the last punic war the due balance between the nobility and the people being then fixed by the contests of the tribunes and not being yet lost by the extent of conquests yet at this very time the horrid practice of poisoning was so common that during part of a season a prætor punished capitally for this crime above three thousand persons in a part of italy and found informations of this nature still multiplying upon him there is a similar or rather a worse instance in the more early times of the commonwealth so depraved in private life were that people whom in their histories we so much admire doubt not but they were really more virtuous during the time of the two triumvirates when they were tearing their common country to pieces and spreading slaughter and desolation over the face of the earth merely for the choice of tyrants f here then is a sufficient inducement to maintain with the utmost zeal in every free state those forms and institutions by which liberty is secured the public good consulted and the avarice or ambition of particular men restrained and punished nothing does more honour to human nature than to see it susceptible of so noble a passion as nothing can be a greater indication of meanness of heart in any man than to see him destitute of it a man who loves only himself without regard to friendship and desert merits the severest blame and a man who is only susceptible of friendship without public spirit or a regard to the community is deficient in the most material part of virtue but this is a subject which needs not be longer insisted on at present there are enow of zealots on both sides who kindle up the passions of their partizans and under pretence of public good pursue the interests and ends of their particular faction for my part shall always be more fond of promoting moderation than zeal though perhaps the surest way of producing moderation in every party is to increase our zeal for the public let us therefore try if it be possible from the foregoing doctrine to draw a lesson of moderation with regard to the parties into which our country is at presentg divided at the same time that we allow not this moderation to abate the industry and passion with which every individual is bound to pursue the good of his country those who either attack or defend a minister in such a government as ours where the utmost liberty is allowed always carry matters to an extreme and exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the public his enemies are sure to charge him with the greatest enormities both in domestic and foreign management and there is no meanness or crime of which in their account he is not capable unnecessary wars scandalous treaties profusion of public treasure oppressive taxes every kind of maladministration is ascribed to him to aggravate the charge his pernicious conduct it is said will extend its baleful influence even to posterity by undermining the best constitution in the world and disordering that wise system of laws institutions and customs by which our ancestors during so many centuries have been so happily governed he is not only a wicked minister in himself but has removed every security provided against wicked ministers for the future on the other hand the partizans of the minister make his panegyric run as high as the accusation against him and celebrate his wise steady and moderate conduct in every part of his administration the honour and interest of the nation supported abroad public credit maintained at home persecution restrained faction subdued the merit of all these blessings is ascribed solely to the minister at the same time he crowns all his other merits by a religious care of the best constitution in the world which he has preserved in all its parts and has transmitted entire to be the happiness and security of the latest posterity when this accusation and panegyric are received by the partizans of each party no wonder they beget an extraordinary ferment on both sides and fill the nation with violent animosities but would fain persuade these partyzealots that there is a flat contradiction both in the accusation and panegyric and that it were impossible for either of them to run so high were it not for this contradiction if our constitution be really that noble fabric the pride ofbritain the envy of our neighbours raised by the labour of so many centuries repaired at the expence of so many millions and cemented by such a profusion of blood say if our constitution does in any degree deserve these eulogiesh it would never have suffered a wicked and weak minister to govern triumphantly for a course of twenty years when opposed by the greatest geniuses in the nation who exercised the utmost liberty of tongue and pen in parliament and in their frequent appeals to the people but if the minister be wicked and weak to the degree so strenuously insisted on the constitution must be faulty in its original principles and he cannot consistently be charged with undermining the best form of government in the world a constitution is only so far good as it provides a remedy against maladministration and if the british when in its greatest vigour and repaired by two such remarkable events as the revolution and accession by which our ancient royal family was sacrificed to it if our constitution say with so great advantages does not in fact provide any such remedy we are rather beholden to any minister who undermines it and affords us an opportunity of erecting a better in its place would employ the same topics to moderate the zeal of those who defend the minister is our constitution so excellent then a change of ministry can be no such dreadful event since it is essential to such a constitution in every ministry both to preserve itself from violation and to prevent all enormities in the administration is our constitution very bad then so extraordinary a jealousy and apprehension on account of changes is ill placed and a man should no more be anxious in this case than a husband who had married a woman from the stews should be watchful to prevent her infidelity public affairs in such a government must necessarily go to confusion by whatever hands they are conducted and the zeal of patriots is in that case much less requisite than the patience and submission of philosophers the virtue and good intentions of cato and brutus are highly laudable but to what purpose did their zeal serve only to hasten the fatal period of the roman government and render its convulsions and dying agonies more violent and painful would not be understood to mean that public affairs deserve no care and attention at all would men be moderate and consistent their claims might be admitted at least might be examined the countryparty might still assert that our constitution though excellent will admit of maladministration to a certain degree and therefore if the minister be bad it is proper to oppose him with a suitable degree of zeal and on the other hand the courtparty may be allowed upon the supposition that the minister were good to defend and with some zeal too his administration would only persuade men not to contend as if they were fighting pro aris focis and change a good constitution into a bad one by the violence of their factionsi have not here considered any thing that is personal in the present controversy in the best civil constitution where every man is restrained by the most rigid laws it is easy to discover either the good or bad intentions of a minister and to judge whether his personal character deserve love or hatred but such questions are of little importance to the public and lay those who employ their pens upon them under a just suspicion either of malevolence or of flattery essay of the first principles of government nothing appears more surprizing to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few and the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers when we enquire by what means this wonder is effected we shall find that as force is always on the side of the governed the governors have nothing to support them but opinion it is therefore on opinion only that government is founded and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments as well as to the most free and most popular the soldan of egypt or the emperor of rome might drive his harmless subjects like brute beasts against their sentiments and inclination but he must at least have led his mamalukes or prætorian bands like men by their opinion opinion is of two kinds to wit opinion of interest and opinion of right by opinion of interest chiefly understand the sense of the general advantage which is reaped from government together with the persuasion that the particular government which is established is equally advantageous with any other that could easily be settled when this opinion prevails among the generality of a state or among those who have the force in their hands it gives great security to any government right is of two kinds right to power and right to property what prevalence opinion of the first kind has over mankind may easily be understood by observing the attachment which all nations have to their ancient government and even to those names which have had the sanction of antiquity antiquity always begets the opinion of right and whatever disadvantageous sentiments we may entertain of mankind they are always found to be prodigal both of blood and treasure in the maintenance of public justicea there is indeed no particular in which at first sight there may appear a greater contradiction in the frame of the human mind than the present when men act in a faction they are apt without shame or remorse to neglect all the ties of honour and morality in order to serve their party and yet when a faction is formed upon a point of right or principle there is no occasion where men discover a greater obstinacy and a more determined sense of justice and equity the same social disposition of mankind is the cause of these contradictory appearances it is sufficiently understood that the opinion of right to property is of moment in all matters of government a noted author has made property the foundation of all government and most of our political writers seem inclined to follow him in that particular this is carrying the matter too far but still it must be owned that the opinion of right to property has a great influence in this subject upon these three opinions therefore of public interest of right to power and of right to property are all governments founded and all authority of the few over the many there are indeed other principles which add force to these and determine limit or alter their operation such as selfinterestfear and affection but still we may assert that these other principles can have no influence alone but suppose the antecedent influence of those opinions abovementioned they are therefore to be esteemed the secondary not the original principles of government for first as to selfinterest by which mean the expectation of particular rewards distinct from the general protection which we receive from government it is evident that the magistrates authority must be antecedently established at least be hoped for in order to produce this expectation the prospect of reward may augment his authority with regard to some particular persons but can never give birth to it with regard to the public men naturally look for the greatest favours from their friends and acquaintance and therefore the hopes of any considerable number of the state would never center in any particular set of men if these men had no other title to magistracy and had no separate influence over the opinions of mankind the same observation may be extended to the other two principles of fear and affection no man would have any reason to fear the fury of a tyrant if he had no authority over any but from fear since as a single man his bodily force can reach but a small way and all the farther power he possesses must be founded either on our own opinion or on the presumed opinion of others and though affection to wisdom and virtue in a sovereign extends very far and has great influence yet he must antecedently be supposed invested with a public character otherwise the public esteem will serve him in no stead nor will his virtue have any influence beyond a narrow sphere a government may endure for several ages though the balance of power and the balance of property do not coincide this chiefly happens where any rank or order of the state has acquired a large share in the property but from the original constitution of the government has no share in the power under what pretence would any individual of that order assume authority in public affairs as men are commonly much attached to their ancient government it is not to be expected that the public would ever favour such usurpations but where the original constitution allows any share of power though small to an order of men who possess a large share of the property it is easy for them gradually to stretch their authority and bring the balance of power to coincide with that of property this has been the case with the house of commons in england most writers that have treated of the british government have supposed that as the lower house represents all the commons of great britain its weight in the scale is proportioned to the property and power of all whom it represents but this principle must not be received as absolutely true for though the people are apt to attach themselves more to the house of commons than to any other member of the constitution that house being chosen by them as their representatives and as the public guardians of their liberty yet are there instances where the house even when in opposition to the crown has not been followed by the people as we may particularly observe of the tory house of commons in the reign of king william were the members obliged to receive instructions from their constituents like the dutch deputies this would entirely alter the case and if such immense power and riches as those of all the commons of great britain were brought into the scale it is not easy to conceive that the crown could either influence that multitude of people or withstand that overbalance of property it is true the crown has great influence over the collective body in the elections of members but were this influence which at present is only exerted once in seven years to be employed in bringing over the people to every vote it would soon be wasted and no skill popularity or revenue could support it must therefore be of opinion that an alteration in this particular would introduce a total alteration in our government and would soon reduce it to a pure republic and perhaps to a republic of no inconvenient form for though the people collected in a body like the roman tribes be quite unfit for government yet when dispersed in small bodies they are more susceptible both of reason and order the force of popular currents and tides is in a great measure broken and the public interest may be pursued with some method and constancy but it is needless to reason any farther concerning a form of government which is never likely to have place in great britain and which seems not to be the aim of any party amongst us let us cherish and improve our ancient government as much as possible without encouraging a passion for such dangerous noveltiesb essay of the origin of government man born in a family is compelled to maintain society from necessity from natural inclination and from habit the same creature in his farther progress is engaged to establish political society in order to administer justice without which there can be no peace among them nor safety nor mutual intercourse we are therefore to look upon all the vast apparatus of our government as having ultimately no other object or purpose but the distribution of justice or in other words the support of the twelve judges kings and parliaments fleets and armies officers of the court and revenue ambassadors ministers and privycounsellors are all subordinate in their end to this part of administration even the clergy as their duty leads them to inculcate morality may justly be thought so far as regards this world to have no other useful object of their institution all men are sensible of the necessity of justice to maintain peace and order and all men are sensible of the necessity of peace and order for the maintenance of society yet notwithstanding this strong and obvious necessity such is the frailty or perverseness of our nature it is impossible to keep men faithfully and unerringly in the paths of justice some extraordinary circumstances may happen in which a man finds his interests to be more promoted by fraud or rapine than hurt by the breach which his injustice makes in the social union but much more frequently he is seduced from his great and important but distant interests by the allurement of present though often very frivolous temptations this great weakness is incurable in human nature men must therefore endeavour to palliate what they cannot cure they must institute some persons under the appellation of magistrates whose peculiar office it is to point out the decrees of equity to punish transgressors to correct fraud and violence and to oblige men however reluctant to consult their own real and permanent interests in a word obedience is a new duty which must be invented to support that of justice and the tyes of equity must be corroborated by those of allegiance but still viewing matters in an abstract light it may be thought that nothing is gained by this alliance and that the factitious duty of obedience from its very nature lays as feeble a hold of the human mind as the primitive and natural duty of justice peculiar interests and present temptations may overcome the one as well as the other they are equally exposed to the same inconvenience and the man who is inclined to be a bad neighbour must be led by the same motives well or ill understood to be a bad citizen and subject not to mention that the magistrate himself may often be negligent or partial or unjust in his administration experience however proves that there is a great difference between the cases order in society we find is much better maintained by means of government and our duty to the magistrate is more strictly guarded by the principles of human nature than our duty to our fellowcitizens the love of dominion is so strong in the breast of man that many not only submit to but court all the dangers and fatigues and cares of government and men once raised to that station though often led astray by private passions find in ordinary cases a visible interest in the impartial administration of justice the persons who first attain this distinction by the consent tacit or express of the people must be endowed with superior personal qualities of valour force integrity or prudence which command respect and confidence and after government is established a regard to birth rank and station has a mighty influence over men and enforces the decrees of the magistrate the prince or leader exclaims against every disorder which disturbs his society he summons all his partizans and all men of probity to aid him in correcting and redressing it and he is readily followed by all indifferent persons in the execution of his office he soon acquires the power of rewarding these services and in the progress of society he establishes subordinate ministers and often a military force who find an immediate and a visible interest in supporting his authority habit soon consolidates what other principles of human nature had imperfectly founded and men once accustomed to obedience never think of departing from that path in which they and their ancestors have constantly trod and to which they are confined by so many urgent and visible motives but though this progress of human affairs may appear certain and inevitable and though the support which allegiance brings to justice be founded on obvious principles of human nature it cannot be expected that men should beforehand be able to discover them or foresee their operation government commences more casually and more imperfectly it is probable that the first ascendant of one man over multitudes begun during a state of war where the superiority of courage and of genius discovers itself most visibly where unanimity and concert are most requisite and where the pernicious effects of disorder are most sensibly felt the long continuance of that state an incident common among savage tribes enured the people to submission and if the chieftain possessed as much equity as prudence and valour he became even during peace the arbiter of all differences and could gradually by a mixture of force and consent establish his authority the benefit sensibly felt from his influence made it be cherished by the people at least by the peaceable and well disposed among them and if his son enjoyed the same good qualities government advanced the sooner to maturity and perfection but was still in a feeble state till the farther progress of improvement procured the magistrate a revenue and enabled him to bestow rewards on the several instruments of his administration and to inflict punishments on the refractory and disobedient before that period each exertion of his influence must have been particular and founded on the peculiar circumstances of the case after it submission was no longer a matter of choice in the bulk of the community but was rigorously exacted by the authority of the supreme magistrate in all governments there is a perpetual intestine struggle open or secret between authority and liberty and neither of them can ever absolutely prevail in the contest a great sacrifice of liberty must necessarily be made in every government yet even the authority which confines liberty can never and perhaps ought never in any constitution to become quite entire and uncontroulable the sultan is master of the life and fortune of any individual but will not be permitted to impose new taxes on his subjects a french monarch can impose taxes at pleasure but would find it dangerous to attempt the lives and fortunes of individuals religion also in most countries is commonly found to be a very intractable principle and other principles or prejudices frequently resist all the authority of the civil magistrate whose power being founded on opinion can never subvert other opinions equally rooted with that of his title to dominion the government which in common appellation receives the appellation of free is that which admits of a partition of power among several members whose united authority is no less or is commonly greater than that of any monarch but who in the usual course of administration must act by general and equal laws that are previously known to all the members and to all their subjects in this sense it must be owned that liberty is the perfection of civil society but still authority must be acknowledged essential to its very existence and in those contests which so often take place between the one and the other the latter may on that account challenge the preference unless perhaps one may say and it may be said with some reason that a circumstance which is essential to the existence of civil society must always support itself and needs be guarded with less jealousy than one that contributes only to its perfection which the indolence of men is so apt to neglect or their ignorance to overlook essay of the independency of parliamenta political writers have established it as a maxim that in contriving any system of government and fixing the several checks and controuls of the constitution every man ought to be supposed a knave and to have no other end in all his actions than private interest by this interest we must govern him and by means of it make him notwithstanding his insatiable avarice and ambition cooperate to public good without this say they we shall in vain boast of the advantages of any constitution and shall find in the end that we have no security for our liberties or possessions except the goodwill of our rulers that is we shall have no security at all it is therefore a just political maxim that every man must be supposed a knave though at the same time it appears somewhat strange that a maxim should be true in politics which is false in fact but to satisfy us on this head we may consider that men are generally more honest in their private than in their public capacity and will go greater lengths to serve a party than when their own private interest is alone concerned honour is a great check upon mankind but where a considerable body of men act together this check is in a great measure removed since a man is sure to be approved of by his own party for what promotes the common interest and he soon learns to despise the clamours of adversaries to which we may add that every court or senate is determined by the greater number of voices so that if selfinterest influences only the majority as it will always dob the whole senate follows the allurements of this separate interest and acts as if it contained not one member who had any regard to public interest and liberty when there offers therefore to our censure and examination any plan of government real or imaginary where the power is distributed among several courts and several orders of men we should always consider the separate interest of each court and each order and if we find that by the skilful division of power this interest must necessarily in its operation concur with public we may pronounce that government to be wise and happy if on the contrary separate interest be not checked and be not directed to the public we ought to look for nothing but faction disorder and tyranny from such a government in this opinion am justified by experience as well as by the authority of all philosophers and politicians both antient and modern how much therefore would it have surprised such a genius as cicero or tacitus to have been told that in a future age there should arise a very regular system of mixed government where the authority was so distributed that one rank whenever it pleased might swallow up all the rest and engross the whole power of the constitution such a government they would say will not be a mixed government for so great is the natural ambition of men that they are never satisfied with power and if one order of men by pursuing its own interest can usurp upon every other order it will certainly do so and render itself as far as possible absolute and uncontroulable but in this opinion experience shews they would have been mistaken for this is actually the case with the british constitution the share of power allotted by our constitution to the house of commons is so great that it absolutely commands all the other parts of the government the kings legislative power is plainly no proper check to it for though the king has a negative in framing laws yet this in fact is esteemed of so little moment that whatever is voted by the two houses is always sure to pass into a law and the royal assent is little better than a form the principal weight of the crown lies in the executive power but besides that the executive power in every government is altogether subordinate to the legislative besides this say the exercise of this power requires an immense expence and the commons have assumed to themselves the sole right of granting money how easy therefore would it be for that house to wrest from the crown all these powers one after another by making every grant conditional and choosing their time so well that their refusal of supply should only distress the government without giving foreign powers any advantage over us did the house of commons depend in the same manner on the king and had none of the members any property but from his gift would not he command all their resolutions and be from that moment absolute as to the house of lords they are a very powerful support to the crown so long as they are in their turn supported by it but both experience and reason shew that they have no force or authority sufficient to maintain themselves alone without such support how therefore shall we solve this paradox and by what means is this member of our constitution confined within the proper limits since from our very constitution it must necessarily have as much power as it demands and can only be confined by itself how is this consistent with our experience of human nature answer that the interest of the body is here restrained by that of the individuals and that the house of commons stretches not its power because such an usurpation would be contrary to the interest of the majority of its members the crown has so many offices at its disposal that when assisted by the honest and disinterested part of the house it will always command the resolutions of the whole so far at least as to preserve the antient constitution from danger we may therefore give to this influence what name we please we may call it by the invidious appellations of corruption and dependence but some degree and some kind of it are inseparable from the very nature of the constitution and necessary to the preservation of our mixed government instead then of asserting absolutely that the dependence of parliament in every degree is an infringement of british liberty the countryparty should have made some concessions to their adversaries and have only examined what was the proper degree of this dependence beyond which it became dangerous to liberty but such a moderation is not to be expected in partymen of any kind after a concession of this nature all declamation must be abandoned and a calm enquiry into the proper degree of courtinfluence and parliamentary dependence would have been expected by the readers and though the advantage in such a controversy might possibly remain to the countryparty yet the victory would not be so compleat as they wish for nor would a true patriot have given an entire loose to his zeal for fear of running matters into a contrary extreme by diminishing too far the influence of the crown it was therefore thought best to deny that this extreme could ever be dangerous to the constitution or that the crown could ever have too little influence over members of parliament all questions concerning the proper medium between extremes are difficult to be decided both because it is not easy to find words proper to fix this medium and because the good and ill in such cases run so gradually into each other as even to render our sentiments doubtful and uncertain but there is a peculiar difficulty in the present case which would embarrass the most knowing and most impartial examiner the power of the crown is always lodged in a single person either king or minister and as this person may have either a greater or less degree of ambition capacity courage popularity or fortune the power which is too great in one hand may become too little in another in pure republics where the authority is distributed among several assemblies or senates the checks and controuls are more regular in their operation because the members of such numerous assemblies may be presumed to be always nearly equal in capacity and virtue and it is only their number riches or authority which enter into consideration but a limited monarchy admits not of any such stability nor is it possible to assign to the crown such a determinate degree of power as will in every hand form a proper counterbalance to the other parts of the constitution this is an unavoidable disadvantage among the many advantages attending that species of government essay whether the british government inclines more to absolute monarchy or to a republic it affords a violent prejudice against almost every science that no prudent man however sure of his principles dares prophesy concerning any event or foretel the remote consequences of things a physician will not venture to pronounce concerning the condition of his patient a fortnight or month after and still less dares a politician foretel the situation of public affairs a few years hence harrington thought himself so sure of his general principle that the balance of power depends on that of property that he ventured to pronounce it impossible ever to reestablish monarchy in england but his book was scarcely published when the king was restored and we see that monarchy has ever since subsisted upon the same footing as before notwithstanding this unlucky example will venture to examine an important question to wit whether thebritishgovernment inclines more to absolute monarchy or to a republic and in which of these two species of government it will most probably terminate as there seems not to be any great danger of a sudden revolution either way shall at least escape the shame attending my temerity if should be found to have been mistaken those who assert that the balance of our government inclines towards absolute monarchy may support their opinion by the following reasons that property has a great influence on power cannot possibly be denied but yet the general maxim that the balance of one depends on the balance of the other must be received with several limitations it is evident that much less property in a single hand will be able to counterbalance a greater property in several not only because it is difficult to make many persons combine in the same views and measures but because property when united causes much greater dependence than the same property when dispersed a hundred persons of l a year apiece can consume all their income and no body shall ever be the better for them except their servants and tradesmen who justly regard their profits as the product of their own labour but a man possessed of l a year if he has either any generosity or any cunning may create a great dependence by obligations and still a greater by expectations hence we may observe that in all free governments any subject exorbitantly rich has always created jealousy even though his riches bore no proportion to those of the state crassuss fortune if remember well amounted only to about two millions and a half of our moneya b yet we find that though his genius was nothing extraordinary he was able by means of his riches alone to counterbalance during his lifetime the power of pompey as well as that of cæsar who afterwards became master of the world the wealth of the medici made them masters of florence though it is probable it was not considerable compared to the united property of that opulent republic these considerations are apt to make one entertain a magnificent idea of the british spirit and love of liberty since we could maintain our free government during so many centuries against our sovereigns who besides the power and dignity and majesty of the crown have always been possessed of much more property than any subject has ever enjoyed in any commonwealth but it may be said that this spirit however great will never be able to support itself against that immense property which is now lodged in the king and which is still encreasing upon a moderate computation there are near three millions a year at the disposal of the crown the civil list amounts to near a million the collection of all taxes to another and the employments in the army and navy together with ecclesiastical preferments to above a third million an enormous sum and what may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth part of the whole income and labour of the kingdom when we add to this great property the encreasing luxury of the nation our proneness to corruption together with the great power and prerogatives of the crown and the command of military force there is no one but must despair of being able without extraordinary efforts to support our free government much longer under these disadvantages on the other hand those who maintain that the byass of the british government leans towards a republic may support their opinion by specious arguments it may be said that though this immense property in the crown be joined to the dignity of first magistrate and to many other legal powers and prerogatives which should naturally give it greater influence yet it really becomes less dangerous to liberty upon that very account were england a republic and were any private man possessed of a revenue a third or even a tenth part as large as that of the crown he would very justly excite jealousy because he would infallibly have great authority in the government and such an irregular authority not avowed by the laws is always more dangerous than a much greater authority derived from them a man possessed of usurped power can set no bounds to his pretensionsc his partizans have liberty to hope for every thing in his favour his enemies provoke his ambition with his fears by the violence of their opposition and the government being thrown into a ferment every corrupted humour in the state naturally gathers to him on the contrary a legal authority though great has always some bounds which terminate both the hopes and pretensions of the person possessed of it the laws must have provided a remedy against its excesses such an eminent magistrate has much to fear and little to hope from his usurpations and as his legal authority is quietly submitted to he has small temptation and small opportunity of extending it farther besides it happens with regard to ambitious aims and projects what may be observed with regard to sects of philosophy and religion a new sect excites such a ferment and is both opposed and defended with such vehemence that it always spreads faster and multiplies its partizans with greater rapidity than any old established opinion recommended by the sanction of the laws and of antiquity such is the nature of novelty that where any thing pleases it becomes doubly agreeable if new but if it displeases it is doubly displeasing upon that very account and in most cases the violence of enemies is favourable to ambitious projects as well as the zeal of partizans it may farther be said that though men be much governed by interest yet even interest itself and all human affairs are entirely governed by opinion now there has been a sudden and sensible change in the opinions of men within these last fifty years by the progress of learning and of liberty most people in this island have divested themselves of all superstitious reverence to names and authority the clergy have much lostd their credit their pretensions and doctrines have been ridiculed and even religion can scarcely support itself in the world the mere name of king commands little respect and to talk of a king as gods vicegerent on earth or to give him any of those magnificent titles which formerly dazzled mankind would but excite laughter in every one though the crown by means of its large revenue may maintain its authority in times of tranquillity upon private interest and influence yet as the least shock or convulsion must break all these interests to pieces the royal power being no longer supported by the settled principles and opinions of men will immediately dissolve had men been in the same disposition at the revolution as they are at present monarchy would have run a great risque of being entirely lost in this island durst venture to deliver my own sentiments amidst these opposite arguments would assert that unless there happen some extraordinary convulsion the power of the crown by means of its large revenue is rather upon the encrease though at the same time own that its progress seems very slow and almost insensible the tide has run long and with some rapidity to the side of popular government and is just beginning to turn towards monarchy it is well known that every government must come to a period and that death is unavoidable to the political as well as to the animal body but as one kind of death may be preferable to another it may be enquired whether it be more desirable for the british constitution to terminate in a popular government or in absolute monarchy here would frankly declare that though liberty be preferable to slavery in almost every case yet should rather wish to see an absolute monarch than a republic in this island for let us consider what kind of republic we have reason to expect the question is not concerning any fine imaginary republic of which a man may form a plan in his closet there is no doubt but a popular government may be imagined more perfect than absolute monarchy or even than our present constitution but what reason have we to expect that any such government will ever be established in great britain upon the dissolution of our monarchy if any single person acquire power enough to take our constitution to pieces and put it up anew he is really an absolute monarch and we have already had an instance of this kind sufficient to convince us that such a person will never resign his power or establish any free government matters therefore must be trusted to their natural progress and operation and the house of commons according to its present constitution must be the only legislature in such a popular government the inconveniencies attending such a situation of affairs present themselves by thousands if the house of commons in such a case ever dissolve itself which is not to be expected we may look for a civil war every election if it continue itself we shall suffer all the tyranny of a faction subdivided into new factions and as such a violent government cannot long subsist we shall at last after many convulsions and civil wars find repose in absolute monarchy which it would have been happier for us to have established peaceably from the beginning absolute monarchy therefore is the easiest death the true euthanasia of the british constitution thus if we have reason to be more jealous of monarchy because the danger is more imminent from that quarter we have also reason to be more jealous of popular government because that danger is more terrible this may teach us a lesson of moderation in all our political controversies essay of parties in general of all men that distinguish themselves by memorable achievements the first place of honour seems due to legislators and founders of states who transmit a system of laws and institutions to secure the peace happiness and liberty of future generations the influence of useful inventions in the arts and sciences may perhaps extend farther than that of wise laws whose effects are limited both in time and place but the benefit arising from the former is not so sensible as that which results from the latter speculative sciences do indeed improve the mind but this advantage reaches only to a few persons who have leisure to apply themselves to them and as to practical arts which encrease the commodities and enjoyments of life it is well known that mens happiness consists not so much in an abundance of these as in the peace and security with which they possess them and those blessings can only be derived from good government not to mention that general virtue and good morals in a state which are so requisite to happiness can never arise from the most refined precepts of philosophy or even the severest injunctions of religion but must proceed entirely from the virtuous education of youth the effect of wise laws and institutions must therefore presume to differ from lord bacon in this particular and must regard antiquity as somewhat unjust in its distribution of honours when it made gods of all the inventors of useful arts such as ceres bacchus æsculapius and dignify legislators such as romulus and theseus only with the appellation of demigods and heroes as much as legislators and founders of states ought to be honoured and respected among men as much ought the founders of sects and factions to be detested and hated because the influence of faction is directly contrary to that of laws factions subvert government render laws impotent and beget the fiercest animosities among men of the same nation who ought to give mutual assistance and protection to each other and what should render the founders of parties more odious is the difficulty of extirpating these weeds when once they have taken root in any state they naturally propagate themselves for many centuries and seldom end but by the total dissolution of that government in which they are sown they are besides plants which grow most plentifully in the richest soil and though absolute governments be not wholly free from them it must be confessed that they rise more easily and propagate themselves faster in free governments where they always infect the legislature itself which alone could be able by the steady application of rewards and punishments to eradicate them factions may be divided into personal and real that is into factions founded on personal friendship or animosity among such as compose the contending parties and into those founded on some real difference of sentiment or interest the reason of this distinction is obvious though must acknowledge that parties are seldom found pure and unmixed either of the one kind or the other it is not often seen that a government divides into factions where there is no difference in the views of the constituent members either real or apparent trivial or material and in those factions which are founded on the most real and most material difference there is always observed a great deal of personal animosity or affection but notwithstanding this mixture a party may be denominated either personal or real according to that principle which is predominant and is found to have the greatest influence personal factions arise most easily in small republics every domestic quarrel there becomes an affair of state love vanity emulation any passion as well as ambition and resentment begets public division the neri and bianchi of florence the fregosi and adorni of genoa the colonesi and orsini of modern rome were parties of this kind men have such a propensity to divide into personal factions that the smallest appearance of real difference will produce them what can be imagined more trivial than the difference between one colour of livery and another in horse races yet this difference begat two most inveterate factions in the greek empire the prasini and veneti who never suspended their animosities till they ruined that unhappy government we find in the roman history a remarkable dissension between two tribes the pollia and papiria which continued for the space of near three hundred years and discovered itself in their suffrages at every election of magistrates this faction was the more remarkable as it could continue for so long a tract of time even though it did not spread itself nor draw any of the other tribes into a share of the quarrel if mankind had not a strong propensity to such divisions the indifference of the rest of the community must have suppressed this foolish animosity that had not any aliment of new benefits and injuries of general sympathy and antipathy which never fail to take place when the whole state is rent into two equal factionsa nothing is more usual than to see parties which have begun upon a real difference continue even after that difference is lost when men are once inlisted on opposite sides they contract an affection to the persons with whom they are united and an animosity against their antagonists and these passions they often transmit to their posterity the real difference between guelf and ghibbelline was long lost in italy before these factions were extinguished the guelfs adhered to the pope the ghibbellines to the emperor yet the family of sforza who were in alliance with the emperor though they were guelfs being expelled milan by the king of france assisted by jacomo trivulzio and the ghibbellines the pope concurred with the latter and they formed leagues with the pope against the emperor the civil wars which arose some few years ago in morocco between the blacks and whites merely on account of their complexion are founded on a pleasant difference we laugh at them but believe were things rightly examined we afford much more occasion of ridicule to the moors for what are all the wars of religion which have prevailed in this polite and knowing part of the world they are certainly more absurd than the moorish civil wars the difference of complexion is a sensible and a real difference but the controversy about an article of faith which is utterly absurd and unintelligible is not a difference in sentiment but in a few phrases and expressions which one party accepts of without understanding them and the other refuses in the same mannerc real factions may be divided into those from interest from principle and from affection of all factions the first are the most reasonable and the most excusable where two orders of men such as the nobles and people have a distinct authority in a government not very accurately balanced and modelled they naturally follow a distinct interest nor can we reasonably expect a different conduct considering that degree of selfishness implanted in human nature it requires great skill in a legislator to prevent such parties and many philosophers are of opinion that this secret like the grand elixir or perpetual motion may amuse men in theory but can never possibly be reduced to practice in despotic governments indeed factions often do not appear but they are not the less real or rather they are more real and more pernicious upon that very account the distinct orders of men nobles and people soldiers and merchants have all a distinct interest but the more powerful oppresses the weaker with impunity and without resistance which begets a seeming tranquillity in such governmentsd there has been an attempt in england to divide the landed and trading part of the nation but without success the interests of these two bodies are not really distinct and never will be so till our public debts encrease to such a degree as to become altogether oppressive and intolerable parties from principle especially abstract speculative principle are known only to modern times and are perhaps the most extraordinary and unaccountable phænomenon that has yet appeared in human affairs where different principles beget a contrariety of conduct which is the case with all different political principles the matter may be more easily explained a man who esteems the true right of government to lie in one man or one family cannot easily agree with his fellowcitizen who thinks that another man or family is possessed of this right each naturally wishes that right may take place according to his own notions of it but where the difference of principle is attended with no contrariety of action but every one may follow his own way without interfering with his neighbour as happens in all religious controversies what madness what fury can beget such unhappy and such fatal divisions two men travelling on the highway the one east the other west can easily pass each other if the way be broad enough but two men reasoning upon opposite principles of religion cannot so easily pass without shocking though one should think that the way were also in that case sufficiently broad and that each might proceed without interruption in his own course but such is the nature of the human mind that it always lays hold on every mind that approaches it and as it is wonderfully fortified by an unanimity of sentiments so is it shocked and disturbed by any contrariety hence the eagerness which most people discover in a dispute and hence their impatience of opposition even in the most speculative and indifferent opinions this principle however frivolous it may appear seems to have been the origin of all religious wars and divisions but as this principle is universal in human nature its effects would not have been confined to one age and to one sect of religion did it not there concur with other more accidental causes which raise it to such a height as to produce the greatest misery and devastation most religions of the ancient world arose in the unknown ages of government when men were as yet barbarous and uninstructed and the prince as well as peasant was disposed to receive with implicit faith every pious tale or fiction which was offered him the magistrate embraced the religion of the people and entering cordially into the care of sacred matters naturally acquired an authority in them and united the ecclesiastical with the civil power but the christian religion arising while principles directly opposite to it were firmly established in the polite part of the world who despised the nation that first broached this novelty no wonder that in such circumstances it was but little countenanced by the civil magistrate and that the priesthood was allowed to engross all the authority in the new sect so bad a use did they make of this power even in those early times that the primitive persecutions may perhaps in part be ascribed to the violence instilled by them into their followers and the same principles of priestly government continuing after christianity became the established religion they have engendered a spirit of persecution which has ever since been the poison of human society and the source of the most inveterate factions in every government such divisions therefore on the part of the people may justly be esteemed factions of principle but on the part of the priests who are the prime movers they are really factions of interest there is another cause beside the authority of the priests and the separation of the ecclesiastical and civil powers which has contributed to render christendom the scene of religious wars and divisions religions that arise in ages totally ignorant and barbarous consist mostly of traditional tales and fictions which may be different in every sect without being contrary to each other and even when they are contrary every one adheres to the tradition of his own sect without much reasoning or disputation but as philosophy was widely spread over the world at the time when christianity arose the teachers of the new sect were obliged to form a system of speculative opinions to divide with some accuracy their articles of faith and to explain comment confute and defend with all the subtilty of argument and science hence naturally arose keenness in dispute when the christian religion came to be split into new divisions and heresies and this keenness assisted the priests in their policy of begetting a mutual hatred and antipathy among their deluded followers sects of philosophy in the ancient world were more zealous than parties of religion but in modern times parties of religion are more furious and enraged than the most cruel factions that ever arose from interest and ambition have mentioned parties from affection as a kind of real parties beside those from interest and principle by parties from affection understand those which are founded on the different attachments of men towards particular families and persons whom they desire to rule over them these factions are often very violent though must own it may seem unaccountable that men should attach themselves so strongly to persons with whom they are no wise acquainted whom perhaps they never saw and from whom they never received nor can ever hope for any favour yet this we often find to be the case and even with men who on other occasions discover no great generosity of spirit nor are found to be easily transported by friendship beyond their own interest we are apt to think the relation between us and our sovereign very close and intimate the splendour of majesty and power bestows an importance on the fortunes even of a single person and when a mans goodnature does not give him this imaginary interest his illnature will from spite and opposition to persons whose sentiments are different from his own essay of the parties of great britain were the british government proposed as a subject of speculation one would immediately perceive in it a source of division and party which it would be almost impossible for it under any administration to avoid the just balance between the republican and monarchical part of our constitution is really in itself so extremely delicate and uncertain that when joined to mens passions and prejudices it is impossible but different opinions must arise concerning it even among persons of the best understanding those of mild tempers who love peace and order and detest sedition and civil wars will always entertain more favourable sentiments of monarchy than men of bold and generous spirits who are passionate lovers of liberty and think no evil comparable to subjection and slavery and though all reasonable men agree in general to preserve our mixed government yet when they come to particulars some will incline to trust greater powers to the crown to bestow on it more influence and to guard against its encroachments with less caution than others who are terrified at the most distant approaches of tyranny and despotic power thus are there parties of principle involved in the very nature of our constitution which may properly enough be denominated those of court and countrya the strength and violence of each of these parties will much depend upon the particular administration an administration may be so bad as to throw a great majority into the opposition as a good administration will reconcile to the court many of the most passionate lovers of liberty but however the nation may fluctuate between them the parties themselves will always subsist so long as we are governed by a limited monarchy but besides this difference of principle those parties are very much fomented by a difference of interest without which they could scarcely ever be dangerous or violent the crown will naturally bestow all trust and power upon those whose principles real or pretended are most favourable to monarchical government and this temptation will naturally engage them to go greater lengths than their principles would otherwise carry them their antagonists who are disappointed in their ambitious aims throw themselves into the party whose sentiments incline them to be most jealous of royal power and naturally carry those sentiments to a greater height than sound politics will justify thus court and country which are the genuine offspring of the british government are a kind of mixed parties and are influenced both by principle and by interest the heads of the factions are commonly most governed by the latter motive the inferior members of them by the formerb as to ecclesiastical parties we may observe that in all ages of the world priests have been enemies to libertyc and it is certain that this steady conduct of theirs must have been founded on fixed reasons of interest and ambition liberty of thinking and of expressing our thoughts is always fatal to priestly power and to those pious frauds on which it is commonly founded and by an infallible connexion which prevails among all kinds of liberty this privilege can never be enjoyed at least has never yet been enjoyed but in a free government hence it must happen in such a constitution as that of great britain that the established clergy while things are in their natural situation will always be of the courtparty as on the contrary dissenters of all kinds will be of the countryparty since they can never hope for that toleration which they stand in need of but by means of our free government all princes that have aimed at despotic power have known of what importance it was to gain the established clergy as the clergy on their part have shewn a great facility in entering into the views of such princesgustavus vaza was perhaps the only ambitious monarch that ever depressed the church at the same time that he discouraged liberty but the exorbitant power of the bishops in sweden who at that time overtopped the crown itself together with their attachment to a foreign family was the reason of his embracing such an unusual system of politics this observation concerning the propensity of priests to the government of a single person is not true with regard to one sect only the presbyterian and calvinistic clergy in holland were professed friends to the family of orange as the arminians who were esteemed heretics were of the louvestein faction and zealous for liberty but if a prince have the choice of both it is easy to see that he will prefer the episcopal to the presbyterian form of government both because of the greater affinity between monarchy and episcopacy and because of the facility which he will find in such a government of ruling the clergy by means of their ecclesiastical superiors if we consider the first rise of parties in england during the great rebellion we shall observe that it was conformable to this general theory and that the species of government gave birth to them by a regular and infallible operation the english constitution before that period had lain in a kind of confusion yet so as that the subjects possessed many noble privileges which though not exactly bounded and secured by law were universally deemed from long possession to belong to them as their birthright an ambitious or rather a misguided prince arose who deemed all these privileges to be concessions of his predecessors revokeable at pleasure and in prosecution of this principle he openly acted in violation of liberty during the course of several years necessity at last constrained him to call a parliament the spirit of liberty arose and spread itself the prince being without any support was obliged to grant every thing required of him and his enemies jealous and implacable set no bounds to their pretensions here then began those contests in which it was no wonder that men of that age were divided into different parties since even at this day the impartial are at a loss to decide concerning the justice of the quarrel the pretensions of the parliament if yielded to broke the balance of the constitution by rendering the government almost entirely republican if not yielded to the nation was perhaps still in danger of absolute power from the settled principles and inveterate habits of the king which had plainly appeared in every concession that he had been constrained to make to his people in this question so delicate and uncertain men naturally fell to the side which was most conformable to their usual principles and the more passionate favourers of monarchy declared for the king as the zealous friends of liberty sided with the parliament the hopes of success being nearly equal on both sides interest had no general influence in this contest so that roundhead and cavalier were merely parties of principle neither of which disowned either monarchy or liberty but the former party inclined most to the republican part of our government the latter to the monarchical in this respect they may be considered as court and countryparty enflamed into a civil war by an unhappy concurrence of circumstances and by the turbulent spirit of the age the commonwealths men and the partizans of absolute power lay concealed in both parties and formed but an inconsiderable part of them the clergy had concurred with the kings arbitrary designs and in return were allowed to persecute their adversaries whom they called heretics and schismatics the established clergy were episcopal the nonconformists presbyterian so that all things concurred to throw the former without reserve into the kings party and the latter into that of the parliamentf every one knows the event of this quarrel fatal to the king first to the parliament afterwards after many confusions and revolutions the royal family was at last restored and the ancient government reestablishedcharles was not made wiser by the example of his father but prosecuted the same measures though at first with more secrecy and caution new parties arose under the appellation of whig and tory which have continued ever since to confound and distract our government to determine the nature of these parties is perhaps one of the most difficult problems that can be met with and is a proof that history may contain questions as uncertain as any to be found in the most abstract sciences we have seen the conduct of the two parties during the course of seventy years in a vast variety of circumstances possessed of power and deprived of it during peace and during war persons who profess themselves of one side or other we meet with every hour in company in our pleasures in our serious occupations we ourselves are constrained in a manner to take party and living in a country of the highest liberty every one may openly declare all his sentiments and opinions yet are we at a loss to tell the nature pretensions and principles of the different factionsg when we compare the parties of whig and tory with those of roundhead and cavalier the most obvious difference that appears between them consists in the principles of passive obedience and indefeasible right which were but little heard of among the cavaliers but became the universal doctrine and were esteemed the true characteristic of a tory were these principles pushed into their most obvious consequences they imply a formal renunciation of all our liberties and an avowal of absolute monarchy since nothing can be a greater absurdity than a limited power which must not be resisted even when it exceeds its limitations but as the most rational principles are often but a weak counterpoise to passion it is no wonder that these absurd principlesh were found too weak for that effect the tories as men were enemies to oppression and also as englishmen they were enemies to arbitrary power their zeal for liberty was perhaps less fervent than that of their antagonists but was sufficient to make them forget all their general principles when they saw themselves openly threatened with a subversion of the ancient government from these sentiments arose the revolution an event of mighty consequence and the firmest foundation of british liberty the conduct of the tories during that event and after it will afford us a true insight into the nature of that party in the first place they appear to have had the genuine sentiments of britons in their affection for liberty and in their determined resolution not to sacrifice it to any abstract principle whatsoever or to any imaginary rights of princes this part of their character might justly have been doubted of before the revolution from the obvious tendency of their avowed principles and from theiri compliances with a court which seemed to make little secret of its arbitrary designs the revolution shewed them to have been in this respect nothing but a genuine courtparty such as might be expected in a british government that is lovers of liberty but greater lovers of monarchy it must however be confessed that they carried their monarchical principles farther even in practice but more so in theory than was in any degree consistent with a limited government secondly neither their principles nor affections concurred entirely or heartily with the settlement made at the revolution or with that which has since taken place this part of their character may seem opposite to the former since any other settlement in those circumstances of the nation must probably have been dangerous if not fatal to liberty but the heart of man is made to reconcile contradictions and this contradiction is not greater than that between passive obedience and the resistance employed at the revolution a tory therefore since the revolution may be defined in a few words to be a lover of monarchy though without abandoning liberty and a partizan of the family ofstuart as a whig may be defined to be a lover of liberty though without renouncing monarchy and a friend to the settlement in theprotestantlinej these different views with regard to the settlement of the crown were accidental but natural additions to the principles of the court and country parties which are the genuine divisions in the british government a passionate lover of monarchy is apt to be displeased at any change of the succession as savouring too much of a commonwealth a passionate lover of liberty is apt to think that every part of the government ought to be subordinate to the interests of liberty some who will not venture to assert that the real difference between whig and tory was lost at the revolution seem inclined to think that the difference is now abolished and that affairs are so far returned to their natural state that there are at present no other parties among us but court and country that is men who by interest or principle are attached either to monarchy or liberty the tories have been so long obliged to talk in the republican stile that they seem to have made converts of themselves by their hypocrisy and to have embraced the sentiments as well as language of their adversaries there are however very considerable remains of that party in england with all their old prejudices and a proof that court and country are not our only parties is that almost all the dissenters side with the court and the lower clergy at least of the church of england with the opposition this may convince us that some biass still hangs upon our constitution some extrinsic weight which turns it from its natural course and causes a confusion in our parties k essay of superstition and enthusiasm that the corruption of the best things produces the worst is grown into a maxim and is commonly proved among other instances by the pernicious effects of superstition and enthusiasm the corruptions of true religion these two species of false religion though both pernicious are yet of a very different and even of a contrary nature the mind of man is subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions proceeding either from the unhappy situation of private or public affairs from ill health from a gloomy and melancholy disposition or from the concurrence of all these circumstances in such a state of mind infinite unknown evils are dreaded from unknown agents and where real objects of terror are wanting the soul active to its own prejudice and fostering its predominant inclination finds imaginary ones to whose power and malevolence it sets no limits as these enemies are entirely invisible and unknown the methods taken to appease them are equally unaccountable and consist in ceremonies observances mortifications sacrifices presents or in any practice however absurd or frivolous which either folly or knavery recommends to a blind and terrified credulity weakness fear melancholy together with ignorance are therefore the true sources of superstition but the mind of man is also subject to an unaccountable elevation and presumption arising from prosperous success from luxuriant health from strong spirits or from a bold and confident disposition in such a state of mind the imagination swells with great but confused conceptions to which no sublunary beauties or enjoyments can correspond every thing mortal and perishable vanishes as unworthy of attention and a full range is given to the fancy in the invisible regions or world of spirits where the soul is at liberty to indulge itself in every imagination which may best suit its present taste and disposition hence arise rapturestransports and surprising flights of fancy and confidence and presumption still encreasing these raptures being altogether unaccountable and seeming quite beyond the reach of our ordinary faculties are attributed to the immediate inspiration of that divine being who is the object of devotion in a little time the inspired person comes to regard himself as a distinguished favourite of the divinity and when this frenzy once takes place which is the summit of enthusiasm every whimsy is consecrated human reason and even morality are rejected as fallacious guides and the fanatic madman delivers himself over blindly and without reserve to the supposed illapses of the spirit and to inspiration from above hope pride presumption a warm imagination together with ignorance are therefore the true sources of enthusiasm these two species of false religion might afford occasion to many speculations but shall confine myself at present to a few reflections concerning their different influence on government and society a my first reflection is that superstition is favourable to priestly power and enthusiasm not less or rather more contrary to it than sound reason and philosophy as superstition is founded on fear sorrow and a depression of spirits it represents the man to himself in such despicable colours that he appears unworthy in his own eyes of approaching the divine presence and naturally has recourse to any other person whose sanctity of life or perhaps impudence and cunning have made him be supposed more favoured by the divinity to him the superstitious entrust their devotions to his care they recommend their prayers petitions and sacrifices and by his means they hope to render their addresses acceptable to their incensed deity hence the origin of priestsb who may justly be regardedc as an invention of a timorous and abject superstition which ever diffident of itself dares not offer up its own devotions but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to the divinity by the mediation of his supposed friends and servants as superstition is a considerable ingredient in almost all religions even the most fanatical there being nothing but philosophy able entirely to conquer these unaccountable terrors hence it proceeds that in almost every sect of religion there are priests to be found but the stronger mixture there is of superstition the higher is the authority of the priesthoodd on the other hand it may be observed that all enthusiasts have been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have expressed great independence in their devotion with a contempt of forms ceremonies and traditions the quakers are the most egregious though at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts that have yet been known and are perhaps the only sect that have never admitted priests amongst them the independents of all the english sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage the presbyterians follow after at an equal distance in both particulars in short this observation is founded in experience and will also appear to be founded in reason if we consider that as enthusiasm arises from a presumptuous pride and confidence it thinks itself sufficiently qualified to approach the divinity without any human mediator its rapturous devotions are so fervent that it even imagines itself actually to approach him by the way of contemplation and inward converse which makes it neglect all those outward ceremonies and observances to which the assistance of the priests appears so requisite in the eyes of their superstitious votaries the fanatic consecrates himself and bestows on his own person a sacred character much superior to what forms and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other my second reflection with regard to these species of false religion is that religions which partake of enthusiasm are on their first rise more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition but in a little time become more gentle and moderate the violence of this species of religion when excited by novelty and animated by opposition appears from numberless instances of the anabaptists in germany the camisars in france the levellers and other fanatics in england and the covenanters in scotland enthusiasm being founded on strong spirits and a presumptuous boldness of character it naturally begets the most extreme resolutions especially after it rises to that height as to inspire the deluded fanatic with the opinion of divine illuminations and with a contempt for the common rules of reason morality and prudence it is thus enthusiasm produces the most cruel disorders in human society but its fury is like that of thunder and tempest which exhaust themselves in a little time and leave the air more calm and serene than before when the first fire of enthusiasm is spent men naturally in all fanatical sects sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matters there being no body of men among them endowed with sufficient authority whose interest is concerned to support the religious spirit no rites no ceremonies no holy observances which may enter into the common train of life and preserve the sacred principles from oblivion superstition on the contrary steals in gradually and insensibly renders men tame and submissive is acceptable to the magistrate and seems inoffensive to the people till at last the priest having firmly established his authority becomes the tyrant and disturber of human society by his endless contentions persecutions and religious wars how smoothly did the romish church advance in her acquisition of power but into what dismal convulsions did she throw all europe in order to maintain it on the other hand our sectaries who were formerly such dangerous bigots are now become very free reasoners and the quakers seem to approach nearly the only regular body of deists in the universe the literati or the disciples of confucius in china my third observation on this head is that superstition is an enemy to civil liberty and enthusiasm a friend to it as superstition groans under the dominion of priests and enthusiasm is destructive of all ecclesiastical power this sufficiently accounts for the present observation not to mention that enthusiasm being the infirmity of bold and ambitious tempers is naturally accompanied with a spirit of liberty as superstition on the contrary renders men tame and abject and fits them for slavery we learn from english history that during the civil wars the independents and deists though the most opposite in their religious principles yet were united in their political ones and were alike passionate for a commonwealth and since the origin of whig and tory the leaders of the whigs have either been deists or profest latitudinarians in their principles that is friends to toleration and indifferent to any particular sect of christians while the sectaries who have all a strong tincture of enthusiasm have always without exception concurred with that party in defence of civil liberty the resemblance in their superstitions long united the highchurch tories and the roman catholics in support of prerogative and kingly power though experience of the tolerating spirit of the whigs seems of late to have reconciled the catholics to that party the molinists and jansenists in france have a thousand unintelligible disputes which are not worthy the reflection of a man of sense but what principally distinguishes these two sects and alone merits attention is the different spirit of their religion the molinists conducted by the jesuits are great friends to superstition rigid observers of external forms and ceremonies and devoted to the authority of the priests and to tradition the jansenists are enthusiasts and zealous promoters of the passionate devotion and of the inward life little influenced by authority and in a word but half catholics the consequences are exactly conformable to the foregoing reasoning the jesuits are the tyrants of the people and the slaves of the court and the jansenists preserve alive the small sparks of the love of liberty which are to be found in the french nation essay of the dignity or meanness of human naturea there are certain sects which secretly form themselves in the learned world as well as factions in the political and though sometimes they come not to an open rupture they give a different turn to the ways of thinking of those who have taken part on either side the most remarkable of this kind are the sects founded on the different sentiments with regard to the dignity of human nature which is a point that seems to have divided philosophers and poets as well as divines from the beginning of the world to this day some exalt our species to the skies and represent man as a kind of human demigod who derives his origin from heaven and retains evident marks of his lineage and descent others insist upon the blind sides of human nature and can discover nothing except vanity in which man surpasses the other animals whom he affects so much to despise if an author possess the talent of rhetoric and declamation he commonly takes part with the former if his turn lie towards irony and ridicule he naturally throws himself into the other extreme am far from thinking that all those who have depreciated our species have been enemies to virtue and have exposed the frailties of their fellow creatures with any bad intention on the contrary am sensible that a delicate sense of morals especially when attended with a splenetic temperb is apt to give a man a disgust of the world and to make him consider the common course of human affairs with too much indignation must however be of opinion that the sentiments of those who are inclined to think favourably of mankind are more advantageous to virtue than the contrary principles which give us a mean opinion of our nature when a man is prepossessed with a high notion of his rank and character in the creation he will naturally endeavour to act up to it and will scorn to do a base or vicious action which might sink him below that figure which he makes in his own imagination accordingly we find that all our polite and fashionable moralists insist upon this topic and endeavour to represent vice as unworthy of man as well as odious in itselfc we find few disputes that are not founded on some ambiguity in the expression and am persuaded that the present dispute concerning the dignity or meanness of human nature is not more exempt from it than any other it may therefore be worth while to consider what is real and what is only verbal in this controversy that there is a natural difference between merit and demerit virtue and vice wisdom and folly no reasonable man will deny yet is it evident that in affixing the term which denotes either our approbation or blame we are commonly more influenced by comparison than by any fixed unalterable standard in the nature of things in like manner quantity and extension and bulk are by every one acknowledged to be real things but when we call any animal great or little we always form a secret comparison between that animal and others of the same species and it is that comparison which regulates our judgment concerning its greatness a dog and a horse may be of the very same size while the one is admired for the greatness of its bulk and the other for the smallness when am present therefore at any dispute always consider with myself whether it be a question of comparison or not that is the subject of the controversy and if it be whether the disputants compare the same objects together or talk of things that are widely differentd in forming our notions of human nature we are apt to make a comparison between men and animals the only creatures endowed with thought that fall under our senses certainly this comparison is favourable to mankind on the one hand we see a creature whose thoughts are not limited by any narrow bounds either of place or time who carries his researches into the most distant regions of this globe and beyond this globe to the planets and heavenly bodies looks backward to consider the first origin at least the history of human race casts his eye forward to see the influence of his actions upon posterity and the judgments which will be formed of his character a thousand years hence a creature who traces causes and effects to a great length and intricacy extracts general principles from particular appearances improves upon his discoveries corrects his mistakes and makes his very errors profitable on the other hand we are presented with a creature the very reverse of this limited in its observations and reasonings to a few sensible objects which surround it without curiosity without foresight blindly conducted by instinct and attaining in a short time its utmost perfection beyond which it is never able to advance a single step what a wide difference is there between these creatures and how exalted a notion must we entertain of the former in comparison of the latter there are two means commonly employed to destroy this conclusion first by making an unfair representation of the case and insisting only upon the weaknesses of human nature and secondly by forming a new and secret comparison between man and beings of the most perfect wisdom among the other excellencies of man this is one that he can form an idea of perfections much beyond what he has experience of in himself and is not limited in his conception of wisdom and virtue he can easily exalt his notions and conceive a degree of knowledge which when compared to his own will make the latter appear very contemptible and will cause the difference between that and the sagacity of animals in a manner to disappear and vanish now this being a point in which all the world is agreed that human understanding falls infinitely short of perfect wisdom it is proper we should know when this comparison takes place that we may not dispute where there is no real difference in our sentiments man falls much more short of perfect wisdom and even of his own ideas of perfect wisdom than animals do of man yet the latter difference is so considerable that nothing but a comparison with the former can make it appear of little moment it is also usual to compare one man with another and finding very few whom we can call wise or virtuous we are apt to entertain a contemptible notion of our species in general that we may be sensible of the fallacy of this way of reasoning we may observe that the honourable appellations of wise and virtuous are not annexed to any particular degree of those qualities of wisdom and virtue but arise altogether from the comparison we make between one man and another when we find a man who arrives at such a pitch of wisdom as is very uncommon we pronounce him a wise man so that to say there are few wise men in the world is really to say nothing since it is only by their scarcity that they merit that appellation were the lowest of our species as wise as tully or lord bacon we should still have reason to say that there are few wise men for in that case we should exalt our notions of wisdom and should not pay a singular honour to any one who was not singularly distinguished by his talents in like manner have heard it observed by thoughtless people that there are few women possessed of beauty in comparison of those who want it not considering that we bestow the epithet of beautiful only on such as possess a degree of beauty that is common to them with a few the same degree of beauty in a woman is called deformity which is treated as real beauty in one of our sex as it is usual in forming a notion of our species to compare it with the other species above or below it or to compare the individuals of the species among themselves so we often compare together the different motives or actuating principles of human nature in order to regulate our judgment concerning it and indeed this is the only kind of comparison which is worth our attention or decides any thing in the present question were our selfish and vicious principles so much predominant above our social and virtuous as is asserted by some philosophers we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemptible notion of human nature there is much of a dispute of words in all this controversy when a man denies the sincerity of all public spirit or affection to a country and community am at a loss what to think of him perhaps he never felt this passion in so clear and distinct a manner as to remove all his doubts concerning its force and reality but when he proceeds afterwards to reject all private friendship if no interest or selflove intermix itself am then confident that he abuses terms and confounds the ideas of things since it is impossible for any one to be so selfish or rather so stupid as to make no difference between one man and another and give no preference to qualities which engage his approbation and esteem is he also say as insensible to anger as he pretends to be to friendship and does injury and wrong no more affect him than kindness or benefits impossible he does not know himself he has forgotten the movements of his heart or rather he makes use of a different language from the rest of his countrymen and calls not things by their proper names what say you of natural affection subjoin is that also a species of selflove yes all is selflove your children are loved only because they are yours your friend for a like reason and your country engages you only so far as it has a connexion with yourself were the idea of self removed nothing would affect you you would be altogether unactive and insensible or if you ever gave yourself any movement it would only be from vanity and a desire of fame and reputation to this same self am willing reply to receive your interpretation of human actions provided you admit the facts that species of selflove which displays itself in kindness to others you must allow to have great influence over human actions and even greater on many occasions than that which remains in its original shape and form for how few are there who having a family children and relations do not spend more on the maintenance and education of these than on their own pleasures this indeed you justly observe may proceed from their selflove since the prosperity of their family and friends is one or the chief of their pleasures as well as their chief honour be you also one of these selfish men and you are sure of every ones good opinion and good will or not to shock your ears with these expressions the selflove of every one and mine among the rest will then incline us to serve you and speak well of youe in my opinion there are two things which have led astray those philosophers that have insisted so much on the selfishness of man in the first place they found that every act of virtue or friendship was attended with a secret pleasure whence they concluded that friendship and virtue could not be disinterested but the fallacy of this is obvious the virtuous sentiment or passion produces the pleasure and does not arise from it feel a pleasure in doing good to my friend because love him but do not love him for the sake of that pleasure in the second place it has always been found that the virtuous are far from being indifferent to praise and therefore they have been represented as a set of vainglorious men who had nothing in view but the applauses of others but this also is a fallacy it is very unjust in the world when they find any tincture of vanity in a laudable action to depreciate it upon that account or ascribe it entirely to that motive the case is not the same with vanity as with other passions where avarice or revenge enters into any seemingly virtuous action it is difficult for us to determine how far it enters and it is natural to suppose it the sole actuating principle but vanity is so closely allied to virtue and to love the fame of laudable actions approaches so near the love of laudable actions for their own sake that these passions are more capable of mixture than any other kinds of affection and it is almost impossible to have the latter without some degree of the former accordingly we find that this passion for glory is always warped and varied according to the particular taste or disposition of the mind on which it falls nero had the same vanity in driving a chariot that trajan had in governing the empire with justice and ability to love the glory of virtuous deeds is a sure proof of the love of virtue essay of libertya those who employ their pens on political subjects free from partyrage and partyprejudices cultivate a science which of all others contributes most to public utility and even to the private satisfaction of those who addict themselves to the study of it am apt however to entertain a suspicion that the world is still too young to fix many general truths in politics which will remain true to the latest posterity we have not as yet had experience of three thousand years so that not only the art of reasoning is still imperfect in this science as in all others but we even want sufficient materials upon which we can reason it is not fully known what degree of refinement either in virtue or vice human nature is susceptible of nor what may be expected of mankind from any great revolution in their education customs or principles machiavel was certainly a great genius but having confined his study to the furious and tyrannical governments of ancient times or to the little disorderly principalities of italy his reasonings especially upon monarchical government have been found extremely defective and there scarcely is any maxim in his prince which subsequent experience has not entirely refuted a weak prince says he is incapable of receiving good counsel for if he consult with several he will not be able to choose among their different counsels if he abandon himself to one that minister may perhaps have capacity but he will not long be a minister he will be sure to dispossess his master and place himself and his family upon the throne mention this among many instances of the errors of that politician proceeding in a great measure from his having lived in too early an age of the world to be a good judge of political truth almost all the princes of europe are at present governed by their ministers and have been so for near two centuries and yet no such event has ever happened or can possibly happen sejanus might project dethroning the cæsars but fleury though ever so vicious could not while in his senses entertain the least hopes of dispossessing the bourbons trade was never esteemed an affair of state till the last century and there scarcely is any ancient writer on politics who has made mention of it even the italians have kept a profound silence with regard to it though it has now engaged the chief attention as well of ministers of state as of speculative reasoners the great opulence grandeur and military achievements of the two maritime powers seem first to have instructed mankind in the importance of an extensive commerce having therefore intended in this essay to make a full comparison of civil liberty and absolute government and to showc the great advantages of the former above the latter began to entertain a suspicion that no man in this age was sufficiently qualified for such an undertaking and that whatever any one should advance on that head would in all probability be refuted by further experience and be rejected by posterity such mighty revolutions have happened in human affairs and so many events have arisen contrary to the expectation of the ancients that they are sufficient to beget the suspicion of still further changes it had been observed by the ancients that all the arts and sciences arose among free nations and that the persians and egyptians notwithstanding their ease opulence and luxury made but faint efforts towards a relish in those finer pleasures which were carried to such perfection by the greeks amidst continual wars attended with poverty and the greatest simplicity of life and manners it had also been observed that when the greeks lost their liberty though they increased mightily in riches by means of the conquests of alexander yet the arts from that moment declined among them and have never since been able to raise their head in that climate learning was transplanted to rome the only free nation at that time in the universe and having met with so favourable a soil it made prodigious shoots for above a century till the decay of liberty produced also the decay of letters and spread a total barbarism over the world from these two experiments of which each was double in its kind and shewed the fall of learning in absolute governments as well as its rise in popular ones longinus thought himself sufficiently justified in asserting that the arts and sciences could never flourish but in a free government and in this opinion he has been followed by several eminent writers in our own country who either confined their view merely to ancient facts or entertained too great a partiality in favour of that form of government established amongst us but what would these writers have said to the instances of modern rome and of florence of which the former carried to perfection all the finer arts of sculpture painting and music as well as poetry though it groaned under tyranny and under the tyranny of priests while the latter made its chief progress in the arts and sciences after it began to lose its liberty by the usurpation of the family of medici ariosto tasso galileo more than raphael and michael angelo were not born in republics and though the lombard school was famous as well as the roman yet the venetians have had the smallest share in its honours and seem rather inferior to the other italians in their genius for the arts and sciences rubens established his school at antwerp not at amsterdam dresden not hamburgh is the centre of politeness in germany but the most eminent instance of the flourishing of learning in absolute governments is that of france which scarcely ever enjoyed any established liberty and yet has carried the arts and sciences as near perfection as any other nation the english are perhaps greater philosophersd the italians better painters and musicians the romans were greater orators but the french are the only people except the greeks who have been at once philosophers poets orators historians painters architects sculptors and musicians with regard to the stage they have excelled even the greeks who far excelled the englishe and in common life they have in a great measure perfected that art the most useful and agreeable of any lart de vivre the art of society and conversation if we consider the state of the sciences and polite arts in our own country horaces observation with regard to the romans may in a great measure be applied to the british sed in longum tamen ævum manserunt hodieque manent vestigia ruris the elegance and propriety of style have been very much neglected among us we have no dictionary of our language and scarcely a tolerable grammar the first polite prose we have was writ by a man who is still alive as to sprat locke and even temple they knew too little of the rules of art to be esteemed elegant writers the prose of bacon harrington and milton is altogether stiff and pedantic though their sense be excellent men in this country have been so much occupied in the great disputes of religion politics and philosophy that they had no relish for the seemingly minute observations of grammar and criticism and though this turn of thinking must have considerably improved our sense and our talent of reasoning it must be confessed that even in those sciences abovementioned we have not any standardbook which we can transmit to posterity and the utmost we have to boast of are a few essays towards a more just philosophy which indeed promise well but have not as yet reached any degree of perfection it has become an established opinion that commerce can never flourish but in a free government and this opinion seems to be founded on a longer and larger experience than the foregoing with regard to the arts and sciences if we trace commerce in its progress through tyre athens syracuse carthage venice florence genoa antwerp holland england c we shall always find it to have fixed its seat in free governments the three greatest trading towns now in europe are london amsterdam and hamburgh all free cities and protestant cities that is enjoying a double liberty it must however be observed that the great jealousy entertained of late with regard to the commerce of france seems to prove that this maxim is no more certain and infallible than the foregoing and that the subjects of an absolute prince may become our rivals in commerce as well as in learning durst deliver my opinion in an affair of so much uncertainty would assert that notwithstanding the efforts of the french there is something hurtful to commerce inherent in the very nature of absolute government and inseparable from it though the reason should assign for this opinion is somewhat different from that which is commonly insisted on private property seems to me almost as secure in a civilized european monarchy as in a republic nor is danger much apprehended in such a government from the violence of the sovereign more than we commonly dread harm from thunder or earthquakes or any accident the most unusual and extraordinary avarice the spur of industry is so obstinate a passion and works its way through so many real dangers and difficulties that it is not likely to be scared by an imaginary danger which is so small that it scarcely admits of calculation commerce therefore in my opinion is apt to decay in absolute governments not because it is there less secure but because it is less honourable a subordination of ranks is absolutely necessary to the support of monarchy birth titles and place must be honoured above industry and riches and while these notions prevail all the considerable traders will be tempted to throw up their commerce in order to purchase some of those employments to which privileges and honours are annexed since am upon this head of the alterations which time has produced or may produce in politics must observe that all kinds of government free and absolute seem to have undergone in modern times a great change for the better with regard both to foreign and domestic management the balance of power is a secret in politics fully known only to the present age and must add that the internal police of states has also received great improvements within the last century we are informed by sallust that catilines army was much augmented by the accession of the highwaymen about rome though believe that all of that profession who are at present dispersed over europe would not amount to a regiment in ciceros pleadings for milo find this argument among others made use of to prove that his client had not assassinated clodius had milo said he intended to have killed clodius he had not attacked him in the daytime and at such a distance from the city he had waylaid him at night near the suburbs where it might have been pretended that he was killed by robbers and the frequency of the accident would have favoured the deceit this is a surprizing proof of the loose police of rome and of the number and force of these robbers since clodius was at that time attended by thirty slaves who were completely armed and sufficiently accustomed to blood and danger in the frequent tumults excited by that seditious tribunef but though all kinds of government be improved in modern times yet monarchical government seems to have made the greatest advances towards perfection it may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies what was formerly said in praise of republics alone that they are a government of laws not of men they are found susceptible of order method and constancy to a surprizing degree property is there secure industry encouraged the arts flourish and the prince lives secure among his subjects like a father among his children there are perhaps and have been for two centuries near two hundred absolute princes great and small in europe and allowing twenty years to each reign we may suppose that there have been in the whole two thousand monarchs or tyrants as the greeks would have called them yet of these there has not been one not even philip of spain so bad as tiberius caligula nero or domitian who were four in twelve amongst the roman emperorsg it must however be confessed that though monarchical governments have approached nearer to popular ones in gentleness and stability they are still inferior our modern education and customs instil more humanity and moderation than the ancient but have not as yet been able to overcome entirely the disadvantages of that form of government but here must beg leave to advance a conjecture which seems probable but which posterity alone can fully judge of am apt to think that in monarchical governments there is a source of improvement and in popular governments a source of degeneracy which in time will bring these species of civil polity still nearer an equality the greatest abuses which arise in france the most perfect model of pure monarchy proceed not from the number or weight of the taxes beyond what are to be met with in free countries but from the expensive unequal arbitrary and intricate method of levying them by which the industry of the poor especially of the peasants and farmers is in a great measure discouraged and agriculture rendered a beggarly and slavish employment but to whose advantage do these abuses tend if to that of the nobility they might be esteemed inherent in that form of government since the nobility are the true supports of monarchy and it is natural their interest should be more consulted in such a constitution than that of the people but the nobility are in reality the chief losers by this oppression since it ruins their estates and beggars their tenants the only gainers by it are the finançiersh a race of men rather odious to the nobility and the whole kingdom if a prince or minister therefore should arise endowed with sufficient discernment to know his own and the public interest and with sufficient force of mind to break through ancient customs we might expect to see these abuses remedied in which case the difference between that absolute government and our free one would not appear so considerable as at present the source of degeneracy which may be remarked in free governments consists in the practice of contracting debt and mortgaging the public revenues by which taxes may in time become altogether intolerable and all the property of the state be brought into the hands of the public this practice is of modern date the atheniansi though governed by a republic paid near two hundred per cent for those sums of money which any emergence made it necessary for them to borrow as we learn from xenophon among the moderns the dutch first introduced the practice of borrowing great sums at low interest and have well nigh ruined themselves by it absolute princes have also contracted debt but as an absolute prince may make a bankruptcy when he pleases his people can never be oppressed by his debts in popular governments the people and chiefly those who have the highest offices being commonly the public creditors it is difficult for the state to make use of this remedy which however it may sometimes be necessary is always cruel and barbarous this therefore seems to be an inconvenience which nearly threatens all free governments especially our own at the present juncture of affairs and what a strong motive is this to encrease our frugality of public money lest for want of it we be reduced by the multiplicity of taxes or what is worse by our public impotence and inability for defence to curse our very liberty and wish ourselves in the same state of servitude with all the nations that surround us essay of eloquence those who consider the periods and revolutions of human kind as represented in history are entertained with a spectacle full of pleasure and variety and see with surprize the manners customs and opinions of the same species susceptible of such prodigious changes in different periods of time it may however be observed that in civil history there is found a much greater uniformity than in the history of learning and science and that the wars negociations and politics of one age resemble more those of another than the taste wit and speculative principles interest and ambition honour and shame friendship and enmity gratitude and revenge are the prime movers in all public transactions and these passions are of a very stubborn and intractable nature in comparison of the sentiments and understanding which are easily varied by education and example the goths were much more inferior to the romans in taste and science than in courage and virtue but not to compare together nations so widely differenta it may be observed that even this later period of human learning is in many respects of an opposite character to the ancient and that if we be superior in philosophy we are still notwithstanding all our refinements much inferior in eloquence in ancient times no work of genius was thought to require so great parts and capacity as the speaking in public and some eminent writers have pronounced the talents even of a great poet or philosopher to be of an inferior nature to those which are requisite for such an undertaking greece and rome produced each of them but one accomplished orator and whatever praises the other celebrated speakers might merit they were still esteemed much inferior to these great models of eloquence it is observable that the ancient critics could scarcely find two orators in any age who deserved to be placed precisely in the same rank and possessed the same degree of merit calvus cælius curio hortensius cæsar rose one above another but the greatest of that age was inferior to cicero the most eloquent speaker that had ever appeared in rome those of fine taste however pronounced this judgment of the roman orator as well as of the grecian that both of them surpassed in eloquence all that had ever appeared but that they were far from reaching the perfection of their art which was infinite and not only exceeded human force to attain but human imagination to conceive cicero declares himself dissatisfied with his own performances nay even with those of demosthenes ita sunt avidæ capaces meæ aures says he semper aliquid immensum infinitumque desiderant b of all the polite and learned nations england alone possesses a popular government or admits into the legislature such numerous assemblies as can be supposed to lie under the dominion of eloquence but what has england to boast of in this particular in enumerating the great men who have done honour to our country we exult in our poets and philosophers but what orators are ever mentioned or where are the monuments of their genius to be met with there are found indeed in our histories the names of several who directed the resolutions of our parliament but neither themselves nor others have taken the pains to preserve their speeches and the authority which they possessed seems to have been owing to their experience wisdom or power more than to their talents for oratory at present there are above half a dozen speakers in the two houses who in the judgment of the public have reached very near the same pitch of eloquence and no man pretends to give any one the preference above the rest this seems to me a certain proof that none of them have attained much beyond a mediocrity in their art and that the species of eloquence which they aspire to gives no exercise to the sublimer faculties of the mind but may be reached by ordinary talents and a slight application a hundred cabinetmakers in london can work a table or a chair equally well but no one poet can write verses with such spirit and elegance as mr pope we are told that when demosthenes was to plead all ingenious men flocked to athens from the most remote parts of greece as to the most celebrated spectacle of the world at london you may see men sauntering in the court of requests while the most important debate is carrying on in the two houses and many do not think themselves sufficiently compensated for the losing of their dinners by all the eloquence of our most celebrated speakers when old cibber is to act the curiosity of several is more excited than when our prime minister is to defend himself from a motion for his removal or impeachment even a person unacquainted with the noble remains of ancient orators may judge from a few strokes that the stile or species of their eloquence was infinitely more sublime than that which modern orators aspire to how absurd would it appear in our temperate and calm speakers to make use of an apostrophe like that noble one of demosthenes so much celebrated by quintilian and longinus when justifying the unsuccessful battle of chæronea he breaks out no my fellowcitizens no you have not erred swear by the manes of those heroes who fought for the same cause in the plains ofmarathon and platæa who could now endure such a bold and poetical figure as that which cicero employs after describing in the most tragical terms the crucifixion of a roman citizen should paint the horrors of this scene not toromancitizens not to the allies of our state not to those who have ever heard of theromanname not even to men but to brutecreatures or to go farther should lift up my voice in the most desolate solitude to the rocks and mountains yet should surely see those rude and inanimate parts of nature moved with horror and indignation at the recital of so enormous an action with what a blaze of eloquence must such a sentence be surrounded to give it grace or cause it to make any impression on the hearers and what noble art and sublime talents are requisite to arrive by just degrees at a sentiment so bold and excessive to inflame the audience so as to make them accompany the speaker in such violent passions and such elevated conceptions and to conceal under a torrent of eloquence the artifice by which all this is effectuated should this sentiment even appear to us excessive as perhaps it justly may it will at least serve to give an idea of the stile of ancient eloquence where such swelling expressions were not rejected as wholly monstrous and giganticc suitable to this vehemence of thought and expression was the vehemence of action observed in the ancient orators the supplosio pedis or stamping with the foot was one of the most usual and moderate gestures which they made use of though that is now esteemed too violent either for the senate bar or pulpit and is only admitted into the theatre to accompany the most violent passions which are there represented one is somewhat at a loss to what cause we may ascribe so sensible a decline of eloquence in later ages the genius of mankind at all times is perhaps equal the moderns have applied themselves with great industry and success to all the other arts and sciences and a learned nation possesses a popular government a circumstance which seems requisite for the full display of these noble talents but notwithstanding all these advantages our progress in eloquence is very inconsiderable in comparison of the advances which we have made in all other parts of learning shall we assert that the strains of ancient eloquence are unsuitable to our age and ought not to be imitated by modern orators whatever reasons may be made use of to prove this am persuaded they will be found upon examination to be unsound and unsatisfactory first it may be said that in ancient times during the flourishing period of greek and roman learning the municipal laws in every state were but few and simple and the decision of causes was in a great measure left to the equity and common sense of the judges the study of the laws was not then a laborious occupation requiring the drudgery of a whole life to finish it and incompatible with every other study or profession the great statesmen and generals among the romans were all lawyers and cicero to shew the facility of acquiring this science declares that in the midst of all his occupations he would undertake in a few days to make himself a complete civilian now where a pleader addresses himself to the equity of his judges he has much more room to display his eloquence than where he must draw his arguments from strict laws statutes and precedents in the former case many circumstances must be taken in many personal considerations regarded and even favour and inclination which it belongs to the orator by his art and eloquence to conciliate may be disguised under the appearance of equity but how shall a modern lawyer have leisure to quit his toilsome occupations in order to gather the flowers of parnassus or what opportunity shall he have of displaying them amidst the rigid and subtile arguments objections and replies which he is obliged to make use of the greatest genius and greatest orator who should pretend to plead before the chancellor after a months study of the laws would only labour to make himself ridiculous am ready to own that this circumstance of the multiplicity and intricacy of laws is a discouragement to eloquence in modern times but assert that it will not entirely account for the decline of that noble art it may banish oratory from westminsterhall but not from either house of parliament among the athenians the areopagites expressly forbad all allurements of eloquence and some have pretended that in the greek orations written in the judiciary form there is not so bold and rhetorical a stile as appears in the roman but to what a pitch did the athenians carry their eloquence in the deliberative kind when affairs of state were canvassed and the liberty happiness and honour of the republic were the subject of debate disputes of this nature elevate the genius above all others and give the fullest scope to eloquence and such disputes are very frequent in this nation secondly it may be pretended that the decline of eloquence is owing to the superior good sense of the moderns who reject with disdain all those rhetorical tricks employed to seduce the judges and will admit of nothing but solid argument in any debate or deliberation if a man be accused of murder the fact must be proved by witnesses and evidence and the laws will afterwards determine the punishment of the criminal it would be ridiculous to describe in strong colours the horror and cruelty of the action to introduce the relations of the dead and at a signal make them throw themselves at the feet of the judges imploring justice with tears and lamentations and still more ridiculous would it be to employ a picture representing the bloody deed in order to move the judges by the display of so tragical a spectacle though we know that this artifice was sometimes practised by the pleaders of old now banish the pathetic from public discourses and you reduce the speakers merely to modern eloquence that is to good sense delivered in proper expression perhaps it may be acknowledged that our modern customs or our superior good sense if you will should make our orators more cautious and reserved than the ancient in attempting to inflame the passions or elevate the imagination of their audience but see no reason why it should make them despair absolutely of succeeding in that attempt it should make them redouble their art not abandon it entirely the ancient orators seem also to have been on their guard against this jealousy of their audience but they took a different way of eluding it they hurried away with such a torrent of sublime and pathetic that they left their hearers no leisure to perceive the artifice by which they were deceived nay to consider the matter aright they were not deceived by any artifice the orator by the force of his own genius and eloquence first inflamed himself with anger indignation pity sorrow and then communicated those impetuous movements to his audience does any man pretend to have more good sense than julius cæsar yet that haughty conqueror we know was so subdued by the charms of ciceros eloquence that he was in a manner constrained to change his settled purpose and resolution and to absolve a criminal whom before that orator pleaded he was determined to condemn d some objections own notwithstanding his vast success may lie against some passages of the roman orator he is too florid and rhetorical his figures are too striking and palpable the divisions of his discourse are drawn chiefly from the rules of the schools and his wit disdains not always the artifice even of a pun rhyme or jingle of words the grecian addressed himself to an audience much less refined than the roman senate or judges the lowest vulgar of athens were his sovereigns and the arbiters of his eloquence yet is his manner more chaste and austere than that of the other could it be copied its success would be infallible over a modern assembly it is rapid harmony exactly adjusted to the sense it is vehement reasoning without any appearance of art it is disdain anger boldness freedom involved in a continued stream of argument and of all human productions the orations of demosthenes present to us the models which approach the nearest to perfectiond thirdly it may be pretended that the disorders of the ancient governments and the enormous crimes of which the citizens were often guilty afforded much ampler matter for eloquence than can be met with among the moderns were there no verres or catiline there would be no cicero but that this reason can have no great influence is evident it would be easy to find a philip in modern times but where shall we find a demosthenes what remains then but that we lay the blame on the want of genius or of judgment in our speakers who either found themselves incapable of reaching the heights of ancient eloquence or rejected all such endeavours as unsuitable to the spirit of modern assemblies a few successful attempts of this nature might rouze the genius of the nation excite the emulation of the youth and accustom our ears to a more sublime and more pathetic elocution than what we have been hitherto entertained with there is certainly something accidental in the first rise and the progress of the arts in any nation doubt whether a very satisfactory reason can be given why ancient rome though it received all its refinements from greece could attain only to a relish for statuary painting and architecture without reaching the practice of these arts while modern rome has been excited by a few remains found among the ruins of antiquity and has produced artists of the greatest eminence and distinction had such a cultivated genius for oratory as wallerse for poetry arisen during the civil wars when liberty began to be fully established and popular assemblies to enter into all the most material points of government am persuaded so illustrious an example would have given a quite different turn to british eloquence and made us reach the perfection of the ancient model our orators would then have done honour to their country as well as our poets geometers and philosophers and british ciceros have appeared as well as british archimedesesf and virgils g it is seldom or never found when a false taste in poetry or eloquence prevails among any people that it has been preferred to a true upon comparison and reflection it commonly prevails merely from ignorance of the true and from the want of perfect models to lead men into a juster apprehension and more refined relish of those productions of genius when these appear they soon unite all suffrages in their favour and by their natural and powerful charms gain over even the most prejudiced to the love and admiration of them the principles of every passion and of every sentiment is in every man and when touched properly they rise to life and warm the heart and convey that satisfaction by which a work of genius is distinguished from the adulterate beauties of a capricious wit and fancy and if this observation be true with regard to all the liberal arts it must be peculiarly so with regard to eloquence which being merely calculated for the public and for men of the world cannot with any pretence of reason appeal from the people to more refined judges but must submit to the public verdict without reserve or limitation whoever upon comparison is deemed by a common audience the greatest orator ought most certainly to be pronounced such by men of science and erudition and though an indifferent speaker may triumph for a long time and be esteemed altogether perfect by the vulgar who are satisfied with his accomplishments and know not in what he is defective yet whenever the true genius arises he draws to him the attention of every one and immediately appears superior to his rival now to judge by this rule ancient eloquence that is the sublime and passionate is of a much juster taste than the modern or the argumentative and rational and if properly executed will always have more command and authority over mankind we are satisfied with our mediocrity because we have had no experience of any thing better but the ancients had experience of both and upon comparison gave the preference to that kind of which they have left us such applauded models for if mistake not our modern eloquence is of the same stile or species with that which ancient critics denominated attic eloquence that is calm elegant and subtile which instructed the reason more than affected the passions and never raised its tone above argument or common discourse such was the eloquence of lysias among the athenians and of calvus among the romans these were esteemed in their time but when compared with demosthenes and cicero were eclipsed like a taper when set in the rays of a meridian sun those latter orators possessed the same elegance and subtilty and force of argument with the former but what rendered them chiefly admirable was that pathetic and sublime which on proper occasions they threw into their discourse and by which they commanded the resolution of their audience of this species of eloquence we have scarcely had any instance in england at least in our public speakers in our writers we have had some instances which have met with great applause and might assure our ambitious youth of equal or superior glory in attempts for the revival of ancient eloquence lord bolingbrokes productions with all their defects in argument method and precisionh contain a force and energy which our orators scarcely ever aim at though it is evident that such an elevated stile has much better grace in a speaker than in a writer and is assured of more prompt and more astonishing success it is there seconded by the graces of voice and action the movements are mutually communicated between the orator and the audience and the very aspect of a large assembly attentive to the discourse of one man must inspire him with a peculiar elevation sufficient to give a propriety to the strongest figures and expressions it is true there is a great prejudice against set speeches and a man cannot escape ridicule who repeats a discourse as a schoolboy does his lesson and takes no notice of any thing that has been advanced in the course of the debate but where is the necessity of falling into this absurdity a public speaker must know beforehand the question under debate he may compose all the arguments objections and answers such as he thinks will be most proper for his discourse if any thing new occur he may supply it from his invention nor will the difference be very apparent between his elaborate and his extemporary compositions the mind naturally continues with the same impetus or force which it has acquired by its motion as a vessel once impelled by the oars carries on its course for some time when the original impulse is suspended shall conclude this subject with observing that even though our modern orators should not elevate their stile or aspire to a rivalship with the ancient yet is there in most of their speeches a material defect which they might correct without departing from that composed air of argument and reasoning to which they limit their ambition their great affectation of extemporary discourses has made them reject all order and method which seems so requisite to argument and without which it is scarcely possible to produce an entire conviction on the mind it is not that one would recommend many divisions in a public discourse unless the subject very evidently offer them but it is easy without this formality to observe a method and make that method conspicuous to the hearers who will be infinitely pleased to see the arguments rise naturally from one another and will retain a more thorough persuasion than can arise from the strongest reasons which are thrown together in confusion essay of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences nothing requires greater nicety in our enquiries concerning human affairs than to distinguish exactly what is owing to chance and what proceeds from causes nor is there any subject in which an author is more liable to deceive himself by false subtilties and refinements to say that any event is derived from chance cuts short all farther enquiry concerning it and leaves the writer in the same state of ignorance with the rest of mankind but when the event is supposed to proceed from certain and stable causes he may then display his ingenuity in assigning these causes and as a man of any subtilty can never be at a loss in this particular he has thereby an opportunity of swelling his volumes and discovering his profound knowledge in observing what escapes the vulgar and ignorant the distinguishing between chance and causes must depend upon every particular mans sagacity in considering every particular incident but if were to assign any general rule to help us in applying this distinction it would be the following what depends upon a few persons is in a great measure to be ascribed to chance or secret and unknown causes what arises from a great number may often be accounted for by determinate and known causes two natural reasons may be assigned for this rule first if you suppose a dye to have any biass however small to a particular side this biass though perhaps it may not appear in a few throws will certainly prevail in a great number and will cast the balance entirely to that side in like manner when any causes beget a particular inclination or passion at a certain time and among a certain people though many individuals may escape the contagion and be ruled by passions peculiar to themselves yet the multitude will certainly be seized by the common affection and be governed by it in all their actions secondly those principles or causes which are fitted to operate on a multitude are always of a grosser and more stubborn nature less subject to accidents and less influenced by whim and private fancy than those which operate on a few only the latter are commonly so delicate and refined that the smallest incident in the health education or fortune of a particular person is sufficient to divert their course and retard their operation nor is it possible to reduce them to any general maxims or observations their influence at one time will never assure us concerning their influence at another even though all the general circumstances should be the same in both cases to judge by this rule the domestic and the gradual revolutions of a state must be a more proper subject of reasoning and observation than the foreign and the violent which are commonly produced by single persons and are more influenced by whim folly or caprice than by general passions and interests the depression of the lords and rise of the commons in england after the statutes of alienation and the encrease of trade and industry are more easily accounted for by general principles than the depression of the spanish and rise of the french monarchy after the death of charles quint had harry cardinal richlieu and louis been spaniards and philip and and charles been frenchmen the history of these two nations had been entirely reversed for the same reason it is more easy to account for the rise and progress of commerce in any kingdom than for that of learning and a state which should apply itself to the encouragement of the one would be more assured of success than one which should cultivate the other avarice or the desire of gain is an universal passion which operates at all times in all places and upon all persons but curiosity or the love of knowledge has a very limited influence and requires youth leisure education genius and example to make it govern any person you will never want booksellers while there are buyers of books but there may frequently be readers where there are no authors multitudes of people necessity and liberty have begotten commerce in holland but study and application have scarcely produced any eminent writers we may therefore conclude that there is no subject in which we must proceed with more caution than in tracing the history of the arts and sciences lest we assign causes which never existed and reduce what is merely contingent to stable and universal principles those who cultivate the sciences in any state are always few in number the passion which governs them limited their taste and judgment delicate and easily perverted and their application disturbed with the smallest accident chance therefore or secret and unknown causes must have a great influence on the rise and progress of all the refined arts but there is a reason which induces me not to ascribe the matter altogether to chance though the persons who cultivate the sciences with such astonishing success as to attract the admiration of posterity be always few in all nations and all ages it is impossible but a share of the same spirit and genius must be antecedently diffused throughout the people among whom they arise in order to produce form and cultivate from their earliest infancy the taste and judgment of those eminent writers the mass cannot be altogether insipid from which such refined spirits are extracted there is a god within us says ovid who breathes that divine fire by which we are animated poets in all ages have advanced this claim to inspiration there is not however any thing supernatural in the case their fire is not kindled from heaven it only runs along the earth is caught from one breast to another and burns brightest where the materials are best prepared and most happily disposed the question therefore concerning the rise and progress of the arts and sciences is not altogether a question concerning the taste genius and spirit of a few but concerning those of a whole people and may therefore be accounted for in some measure by general causes and principles grant that a man who should enquire why such a particular poet as homer for instance existed at such a place in such a time would throw himself headlong into chimæra and could never treat of such a subject without a multitude of false subtilties and refinements he might as well pretend to give a reason why such particular generals as fabius and scipio lived in rome at such a time and why fabius came into the world before scipio for such incidents as these no other reason can be given than that of horace scit genius natale comes qui temperat astrum naturæ deus humanæ mortalis in unum quodque caput vultu mutabilis albus ater but am persuaded that in many cases good reasons might be given why such a nation is more polite and learned at a particular time than any of its neighbours at least this is so curious a subject that it were a pity to abandon it entirely before we have found whether it be susceptible of reasoning and can be reduced to any general principlesa my first observation on this head is that it is impossible for the arts and sciences to arise at first among any people unless that people enjoy the blessing of a free government in the first ages of the world when men are as yet barbarous and ignorant they seek no farther security against mutual violence and injustice than the choice of some rulers few or many in whom they place an implicit confidence without providing any security by laws or political institutions against the violence and injustice of these rulers if the authority be centered in a single person and if the people either by conquest or by the ordinary course of propagation encrease to a great multitude the monarch finding it impossible in his own person to execute every office of sovereignty in every place must delegate his authority to inferior magistrates who preserve peace and order in their respective districts as experience and education have not yet refined the judgments of men to any considerable degree the prince who is himself unrestrained never dreams of restraining his ministers but delegates his full authority to every one whom he sets over any portion of the people all general laws are attended with inconveniencies when applied to particular cases and it requires great penetration and experience both to perceive that these inconveniencies are fewer than what result from full discretionary powers in every magistrate and also to discern what general laws are upon the whole attended with fewest inconveniencies this is a matter of so great difficulty that men may have made some advances even in the sublime arts of poetry and eloquence where a rapidity of genius and imagination assists their progress before they have arrived at any great refinement in their municipal laws where frequent trials and diligent observation can alone direct their improvements it is not therefore to be supposed that a barbarous monarch unrestrained and uninstructed will ever become a legislator or think of restraining his bashaws in every province or even his cadis in every village we are told that the late czar though actuated with a noble genius and smit with the love and admiration of european arts yet professed an esteem for the turkish policy in this particular and approved of such summary decisions of causes as are practised in that barbarous monarchy where the judges are not restrained by any methods forms or laws he did not perceive how contrary such a practice would have been to all his other endeavours for refining his people arbitrary power in all cases is somewhat oppressive and debasing but it is altogether ruinous and intolerable when contracted into a small compass and becomes still worse when the person who possesses it knows that the time of his authority is limited and uncertain habet subjectos tanquam suos viles ut alienos he governs the subjects with full authority as if they were his own and with negligence or tyranny as belonging to another a people governed after such a manner are slaves in the full and proper sense of the word and it is impossible they can ever aspire to any refinements of taste or reason they dare not so much as pretend to enjoy the necessaries of life in plenty or security to expect therefore that the arts and sciences should take their first rise in a monarchy is to expect a contradiction before these refinements have taken place the monarch is ignorant and uninstructed and not having knowledge sufficient to make him sensible of the necessity of balancing his government upon general laws he delegates his full power to all inferior magistrates this barbarous policy debases the people and for ever prevents all improvements were it possible that before science were known in the world a monarch could possess so much wisdom as to become a legislator and govern his people by law not by the arbitrary will of their fellowsubjects it might be possible for that species of government to be the first nursery of arts and sciences but that supposition seems scarcely to be consistent or rational it may happen that a republic in its infant state may be supported by as few laws as a barbarous monarchy and may entrust as unlimited an authority to its magistrates or judges but besides that the frequent elections by the people are a considerable check upon authority it is impossible but in time the necessity of restraining the magistrates in order to preserve liberty must at last appear and give rise to general laws and statutes the roman consuls for some time decided all causes without being confined by any positive statutes till the people bearing this yoke with impatience created the decemvirs who promulgated the twelve tables a body of laws which though perhaps they were not equal in bulk to one english act of parliament were almost the only written rules which regulated property and punishment for some ages in that famous republic they were however sufficient together with the forms of a free government to secure the lives and properties of the citizens to exempt one man from the dominion of another and to protect every one against the violence or tyranny of his fellowcitizens in such a situation the sciences may raise their heads and flourish but never can have being amidst such a scene of oppression and slavery as always results from barbarous monarchies where the people alone are restrained by the authority of the magistrates and the magistrates are not restrained by any law or statute an unlimited despotism of this nature while it exists effectually puts a stop to all improvements and keeps men from attaining that knowledge which is requisite to instruct them in the advantages arising from a better police and more moderate authority here then are the advantages of free states though a republic should be barbarous it necessarily by an infallible operation gives rise to law even before mankind have made any considerable advances in the other sciences from law arises security from security curiosity and from curiosity knowledge the latter steps of this progress may be more accidental but the former are altogether necessary a republic without laws can never have any duration on the contrary in a monarchical government law arises not necessarily from the forms of government monarchy when absolute contains even something repugnant to law great wisdom and reflexion can alone reconcile them but such a degree of wisdom can never be expected before the greater refinements and improvements of human reason these refinements require curiosity security and law the first growth therefore of the arts and sciences can never be expected in despotic governmentsb there are other causes which discourage the rise of the refined arts in despotic governments though take the want of laws and the delegation of full powers to every petty magistrate to be the principal eloquence certainly springs up more naturally in popular governments emulation too in every accomplishment must there be more animated and enlivened and genius and capacity have a fuller scope and career all these causes render free governments the only proper nursery for the arts and sciences the next observation which shall make on this head is that nothing is more favourable to the rise of politeness and learning than a number of neighbouring and independent states connected together by commerce and policy the emulation which naturally arises among those neighbouring states is an obvious source of improvement but what would chiefly insist on is the stop which such limited territories give both to power and to authority extended governments where a single person has great influence soon become absolute but small ones change naturally into commonwealths a large government is accustomed by degrees to tyranny because each act of violence is at first performed upon a part which being distant from the majority is not taken notice of nor excites any violent ferment besides a large government though the whole be discontented may by a little art be kept in obedience while each part ignorant of the resolutions of the rest is afraid to begin any commotion or insurrection not to mention that there is a superstitious reverence for princes which mankind naturally contract when they do not often see the sovereign and when many of them become not acquainted with him so as to perceive his weaknesses and as large states can afford a great expence in order to support the pomp of majesty this is a kind of fascination on men and naturally contributes to the enslaving of them in a small government any act of oppression is immediately known throughout the whole the murmurs and discontents proceeding from it are easily communicated and the indignation arises the higher because the subjects are not apt to apprehend in such states that the distance is very wide between themselves and their sovereign no man said the prince of conde is a hero to his valet de chambre it is certain that admiration and acquaintance are altogether incompatible towards any mortal creaturec sleep and love convinced even alexander himself that he was not a god but suppose that such as daily attended him could easily from the numberless weaknesses to which he was subject have given him many still more convincing proofs of his humanity but the divisions into small states are favourable to learning by stopping the progress of authority as well as that of power reputation is often as great a fascination upon men as sovereignty and is equally destructive to the freedom of thought and examination but where a number of neighbouring states have a great intercourse of arts and commerce their mutual jealousy keeps them from receiving too lightly the law from each other in matters of taste and of reasoning and makes them examine every work of art with the greatest care and accuracy the contagion of popular opinion spreads not so easily from one place to another it readily receives a check in some state or other where it concurs not with the prevailing prejudices and nothing but nature and reason or at least what bears them a strong resemblanced can force its way through all obstacles and unite the most rival nations into an esteem and admiration of it greece was a cluster of little principalities which soon became republics and being united both by their near neighbourhood and by the ties of the same language and interest they entered into the closest intercourse of commerce and learning there concurred a happy climate a soil not unfertile and a most harmonious and comprehensive language so that every circumstance among that people seemed to favour the rise of the arts and sciences each city produced its several artists and philosophers who refused to yield the preference to those of the neighbouring republics their contention and debates sharpened the wits of men a variety of objects was presented to the judgment while each challenged the preference to the rest and the sciences not being dwarfed by the restraint of authority were enabled to make such considerable shoots as are even at this time the objects of our admiration after the romanchristian or catholic church had spread itself over the civilized world and had engrossed all the learning of the times being really one large state within itself and united under one head this variety of sects immediately disappeared and the peripatetic philosophy was alone admitted into all the schools to the utter depravation of every kind of learning but mankind having at length thrown off this yoke affairs are now returned nearly to the same situation as before and europe is at present a copy at large of what greece was formerly a pattern in miniature we have seen the advantage of this situation in several instances what checked the progress of the cartesian philosophy to which the french nation shewed such a strong propensity towards the end of the last century but the opposition made to it by the other nations of europe who soon discovered the weak sides of that philosophy the severest scrutiny which newtons theory has undergone proceeded not from his own countrymen but from foreigners and if it can overcome the obstacles which it meets with at present in all parts of europe it will probably go down triumphant to the latest posterity the english are become sensible of the scandalous licentiousness of their stage from the example of the french decency and morals the french are convinced that their theatre has become somewhat effeminate by too much love and gallantry and begin to approve of the more masculine taste of some neighbouring nations in china there seems to be a pretty considerable stock of politeness and science which in the course of so many centuries might naturally be expected to ripen into something more perfect and finished than what has yet arisen from them but china is one vast empire speaking one language governed by one law and sympathizing in the same manners the authority of any teacher such as confucius was propagated easily from one corner of the empire to the other none had courage to resist the torrent of popular opinion and posterity was not bold enough to dispute what had been universally received by their ancestors this seems to be one natural reason why the sciences have made so slow a progress in that mighty empire if we consider the face of the globe europe of all the four parts of the world is the most broken by seas rivers and mountains and greece of all countries of europe hence these regions were naturally divided into several distinct governments and hence the sciences arose in greece and europe has been hitherto the most constant habitation of them have sometimes been inclined to think that interruptions in the periods of learning were they not attended with such a destruction of ancient books and the records of history would be rather favourable to the arts and sciences by breaking the progress of authority and dethroning the tyrannical usurpers over human reason in this particular they have the same influence as interruptions in political governments and societies consider the blind submission of the ancient philosophers to the several masters in each school and you will be convinced that little good could be expected from a hundred centuries of such a servile philosophy even the eclectics who arose about the age of augustus notwithstanding their professing to chuse freely what pleased them from every different sect were yet in the main as slavish and dependent as any of their brethren since they sought for truth not in nature but in the several schools where they supposed she must necessarily be found though not united in a body yet dispersed in parts upon the revival of learning those sects of stoics and epicureans platonists and pythagoricians could never regain any credit or authority and at the same time by the example of their fall kept men from submitting with such blind deference to those new sects which have attempted to gain an ascendant over them the third observation which shall form on this head of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences is that though the only proper nursery of these noble plants be a free state yet may they be transplanted into any government and that a republic is most favourable to the growth of the sciences a civilized monarchy to that of the polite arts to balance a large state or society whether monarchical or republican on general laws is a work of so great difficulty that no human genius however comprehensive is able by the mere dint of reason and reflection to effect it the judgments of many must unite in this work experience must guide their labour time must bring it to perfection and the feeling of inconveniencies must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into in their first trials and experiments hence appears the impossibility that this undertaking should be begun and carried on in any monarchy since such a form of government ere civilized knows no other secret or policy than that of entrusting unlimited powers to every governor or magistrate and subdividing the people into so many classes and orders of slavery from such a situation no improvement can ever be expected in the sciences in the liberal arts in laws and scarcely in the manual arts and manufactures the same barbarism and ignorance with which the government commences is propagated to all posterity and can never come to a period by the efforts or ingenuity of such unhappy slaves but though law the source of all security and happiness arises late in any government and is the slow product of order and of liberty it is not preserved with the same difficulty with which it is produced but when it has once taken root is a hardy plant which will scarcely ever perish through the ill culture of men or the rigour of the seasons the arts of luxury and much more the liberal arts which depend on a refined taste or sentiment are easily lost because they are always relished by a few only whose leisure fortune and genius fit them for such amusements but what is profitable to every mortal and in common life when once discovered can scarcely fall into oblivion but by the total subversion of society and by such furious inundations of barbarous invaders as obliterate all memory of former arts and civility imitation also is apt to transport these coarser and more useful arts from one climate to another and make them precede the refined arts in their progress though perhaps they sprang after them in their first rise and propagation from these causes proceed civilized monarchies where the arts of government first invented in free states are preserved to the mutual advantage and security of sovereign and subject however perfect therefore the monarchical form may appear to some politicians it owes all its perfection to the republican nor is it possible that a pure despotism established among a barbarous people can ever by its native force and energy refine and polish itself it must borrow its laws and methods and institutions and consequently its stability and order from free governments these advantages are the sole growth of republics the extensive despotism of a barbarous monarchy by entering into the detail of the government as well as into the principal points of administration for ever prevents all such improvements in a civilized monarchy the prince alone is unrestrained in the exercise of his authority and possesses alone a power which is not bounded by any thing but custom example and the sense of his own interest every minister or magistrate however eminent must submit to the general laws which govern the whole society and must exert the authority delegated to him after the manner which is prescribed the people depend on none but their sovereign for the security of their property he is so far removed from them and is so much exempt from private jealousies or interests that this dependence is scarcely felt and thus a species of government arises to which in a high political rant we may give the name of tyranny but which by a just and prudent administration may afford tolerable security to the people and may answer most of the ends of political society but though in a civilized monarchy as well as in a republic the people have security for the enjoyment of their property yet in both these forms of government those who possess the supreme authority have the disposal of many honours and advantages which excite the ambition and avarice of mankind the only difference is that in a republic the candidates for office must look downwards to gain the suffrages of the people in a monarchy they must turn their attention upwards to court the good graces and favour of the great to be successful in the former way it is necessary for a man to make himself useful by his industry capacity or knowledge to be prosperous in the latter way it is requisite for him to render himself agreeable by his wit complaisance or civility a strong genius succeeds best in republics a refined taste in monarchies and consequently the sciences are the more natural growth of the one and the polite arts of the other not to mention that monarchies receiving their chief stability from a superstitious reverence to priests and princes have commonly abridged the liberty of reasoning with regard to religion and politics and consequently metaphysics and morals all these form the most considerable branches of science mathematics and natural philosophy which only remain are not half so valuablee among the arts of conversation no one pleases more than mutual deference or civility which leads us to resign our own inclinations to those of our companion and to curb and conceal that presumption and arrogance so natural to the human mind a goodnatured man who is well educated practises this civility to every mortal without premeditation or interest but in order to render that valuable quality general among any people it seems necessary to assist the natural disposition by some general motive where power rises upwards from the people to the great as in all republics such refinements of civility are apt to be little practised since the whole state is by that means brought near to a level and every member of it is rendered in a great measure independent of another the people have the advantage by the authority of their suffrages the great by the superiority of their station but in a civilized monarchy there is a long train of dependence from the prince to the peasant which is not great enough to render property precarious or depress the minds of the people but is sufficient to beget in every one an inclination to please his superiors and to form himself upon those models which are most acceptable to people of condition and education politeness of manners therefore arises most naturally in monarchies and courts and where that flourishes none of the liberal arts will be altogether neglected or despised the republics in europe are at present noted for want of politeness the goodmanners of aswisscivilized inholland is an expression for rusticity among the french the english in some degree fall under the same censure notwithstanding their learning and genius and if the venetians be an exception to the rule they owe it perhaps to their communication with the other italians most of whose governments beget a dependence more than sufficient for civilizing their manners it is difficult to pronounce any judgment concerning the refinements of the ancient republics in this particular but am apt to suspect that the arts of conversation were not brought so near to perfection among them as the arts of writing and composition the scurrility of the ancient orators in many instances is quite shocking and exceeds all belief vanity too is often not a little offensive in authors of those ages as well as the common licentiousness and immodesty of their stile quicunque impudicus adulter ganeo manu ventre pene bona patria laceraverat says sallust in one of the gravest and most moral passages of his historynam fuit ante helenam cunnus teterrima belli causa is an expression of horace in tracing the origin of moral good and evilovid and lucretius are almost as licentious in their stile as lord rochester though the former were fine gentlemen and delicate writers and the latterg from the corruptions of that court in which he lived seems to have thrown off all regard to shame and decency juvenal inculcates modesty with great zeal but sets a very bad example of it if we consider the impudence of his expressions shall also be bold to affirm that among the ancients there was not much delicacy of breeding or that polite deference and respect which civility obliges us either to express or counterfeit towards the persons with whom we converse cicero was certainly one of the finest gentlemen of his age yet must confess have frequently been shocked with the poor figure under which he represents his friend atticus in those dialogues where he himself is introduced as a speaker that learned and virtuous roman whose dignity though he was only a private gentleman was inferior to that of no one in rome is there shewn in rather a more pitiful light than philalethess friend in our modern dialogues he is a humble admirer of the orator pays him frequent compliments and receives his instructions with all the deference which a scholar owes to his master even cato is treated in somewhat of a cavalier manner in the dialogues de finibus h one of the most particular details of a real dialogue which we meet with in antiquity is related by polybius when philip king of macedon a prince of wit and parts met with titus flamininus one of the politest of the romans as we learn from plutarch accompanied with ambassadors from almost all the greek cities the ætolian ambassador very abruptly tells the king that he talked like a fool or a madman ληρειν thats evident says his majesty even to a blind man which was a raillery on the blindness of his excellency yet all this did not pass the usual bounds for the conference was not disturbed and flamininus was very well diverted with these strokes of humour at the end when philip craved a little time to consult with his friends of whom he had none present the roman general being desirous also to shew his wit as the historian says tells him that perhaps the reason why he had none of his friends with him was because he had murdered them all which was actually the case this unprovoked piece of rusticity is not condemned by the historian caused no farther resentment in philip than to excite a sardonian smile or what we call a grin and hindered him not from renewing the conference next day plutarch too mentions this raillery amongst the witty and agreeable sayings of flamininusi j cardinal wolsey apologized for his famous piece of insolence in saying ego et rex meus and my king by observing that this expression was conformable to the latin idiom and that a roman always named himself before the person to whom or of whom he spake yet this seems to have been an instance of want of civility among that people the ancients made it a rule that the person of the greatest dignity should be mentioned first in the discourse insomuch that we find the spring of a quarrel and jealousy between the romans and ætolians to have been a poets naming the ætolians before the romans in celebrating a victory gained by their united arms over the macedonians thus livia disgusted tiberius by placing her own name before his in an inscription k no advantages in this world are pure and unmixed in like manner as modern politeness which is naturally so ornamental runs often into affectation and foppery disguise and insincerity so the ancient simplicity which is naturally so amiable and affecting often degenerates into rusticity and abuse scurrility and obscenity if the superiority in politeness should be allowed to modern times the modern notions of gallantry the natural produce of courts and monarchies will probably be assigned as the causes of this refinement no one denies this invention to be modern but some of the more zealous partizans of the ancients have asserted it to be foppish and ridiculous and a reproach rather than a credit to the present age it may here be proper to examine this question nature has implanted in all living creatures an affection between the sexes which even in the fiercest and most rapacious animals is not merely confined to the satisfaction of the bodily appetite but begets a friendship and mutual sympathy which runs through the whole tenor of their lives nay even in those species where nature limits the indulgence of this appetite to one season and to one object and forms a kind of marriage or association between a single male and female there is yet a visible complacency and benevolence which extends farther and mutually softens the affections of the sexes towards each otherl how much more must this have place in man where the confinement of the appetite is not natural but either is derived accidentally from some strong charm of love or arises from reflections on duty and convenience nothing therefore can proceed less from affectation than the passion of gallantry it is natural in the highest degree art and education in the most elegant courts make no more alteration on it than on all the other laudable passions they only turn the mind more towards it they refine it they polish it and give it a proper grace and expression but gallantry is as generous as it is natural to correct such gross vices as lead us to commit real injury on others is the part of morals and the object of the most ordinary education where that is not attended to in some degree no human society can subsist but in order to render conversation and the intercourse of minds more easy and agreeable goodmanners have been invented and have carried the matter somewhat farther wherever nature has given the mind a propensity to any vice or to any passion disagreeable to others refined breeding has taught men to throw the biass on the opposite side and to preserve in all their behaviour the appearance of sentiments different from those to which they naturally incline thus as we are commonly proud and selfish and apt to assume the preference above others a polite man learns to behave with deference towards his companions and to yield the superiority to them in all the common incidents of society in like manner wherever a persons situation may naturally beget any disagreeable suspicion in him it is the part of goodmanners to prevent it by a studied display of sentiments directly contrary to those of which he is apt to be jealous thus old men know their infirmities and naturally dread contempt from the youth hence welleducated youth redouble the instances of respect and deference to their elders strangers and foreigners are without protection hence in all polite countries they receive the highest civilities and are entitled to the first place in every company a man is lord in his own family and his guests are in a manner subject to his authority hence he is always the lowest person in the company attentive to the wants of every one and giving himself all the trouble in order to please which may not betray too visible an affectation or impose too much constraint on his guests gallantry is nothing but an instance of the same generous attention as nature has given man the superiority above woman by endowing him with greater strength both of mind and body it is his part to alleviate that superiority as much as possible by the generosity of his behaviour and by a studied deference and complaisance for all her inclinations and opinions barbarous nations display this superiority by reducing their females to the most abject slavery by confining them by beating them by selling them by killing them but the male sex among a polite people discover their authority in a more generous though not a less evident manner by civility by respect by complaisance and in a word by gallantry in good company you need not ask who is the master of the feast the man who sits in the lowest place and who is always industrious in helping every one is certainly the person we must either condemn all such instances of generosity as foppish and affected or admit of gallantry among the rest the ancient muscovites wedded their wives with a whip instead of a ring the same people in their own houses took always the precedency above foreigners even foreign ambassadors these two instances of their generosity and politeness are much of a piece gallantry is not less compatible with wisdom and prudence than with nature and generosity and when under proper regulations contributes more than any other invention to the entertainment and improvement of the youth of both sexesm among every species of animals nature has founded on the love between the sexes their sweetest and best enjoyment but the satisfaction of the bodily appetite is not alone sufficient to gratify the mind and even among brutecreatures we find that their play and dalliance and other expressions of fondness form the greatest part of the entertainment in rational beings we must certainly admit the mind for a considerable share were we to rob the feast of all its garniture of reason discourse sympathy friendship and gaiety what remains would scarcely be worth acceptance in the judgment of the truly elegant and luxurious what better school for manners than the company of virtuous women where the mutual endeavour to please must insensibly polish the mind where the example of the female softness and modesty must communicate itself to their admirers and where the delicacy of that sex puts every one on his guard lest he give offence by any breach of decencyn among the ancients the character of the fairsex was considered as altogether domestic nor were they regarded as part of the polite world or of good company this perhaps is the true reason why the ancients have not left us one piece of pleasantry that is excellent unless one may except the banquet of xenophon and the dialogues of lucian though many of their serious compositions are altogether inimitable horace condemns the coarse railleries and cold jests of plautus but though the most easy agreeable and judicious writer in the world is his own talent for ridicule very striking or refined this therefore is one considerable improvement which the polite arts have received from gallantry and from courts where it first aroseo but to return from this digression shall advance it as a fourth observation on this subject of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences that when the arts and sciences come to perfection in any state from that moment they naturally or rather necessarily decline and seldom or never revive in that nation where they formerly flourished it must be confessed that this maxim though conformable to experience may at first sight be esteemed contrary to reason if the natural genius of mankind be the same in all ages and in almost all countries as seems to be the truth it must very much forward and cultivate this genius to be possessed of patterns in every art which may regulate the taste and fix the objects of imitation the models left us by the ancients gave birth to all the arts about years ago and have mightily advanced their progress in every country of europe why had they not a like effect during the reign of trajan and his successors when they were much more entire and were still admired and studied by the whole world so late as the emperor justinian the poet by way of distinction was understood among the greeks to be homer among the romans virgil such admiration still remained for these divine geniuses though no poet had appeared for many centuries who could justly pretend to have imitated them a mans genius is always in the beginning of life as much unknown to himself as to others and it is only after frequent trials attended with success that he dares think himself equal to those undertakings in which those who have succeeded have fixed the admiration of mankind if his own nation be already possessed of many models of eloquence he naturally compares his own juvenile exercises with these and being sensible of the great disproportion is discouraged from any farther attempts and never aims at a rivalship with those authors whom he so much admires a noble emulation is the source of every excellence admiration and modesty naturally extinguish this emulation and no one is so liable to an excess of admiration and modesty as a truly great genius next to emulation the greatest encourager of the noble arts is praise and glory a writer is animated with new force when he hears the applauses of the world for his former productions and being roused by such a motive he often reaches a pitch of perfection which is equally surprizing to himself and to his readers but when the posts of honour are all occupied his first attempts are but coldly received by the public being compared to productions which are both in themselves more excellent and have already the advantage of an established reputation were moliere and corneille to bring upon the stage at present their early productions which were formerly so well received it would discourage the young poets to see the indifference and disdain of the public the ignorance of the age alone could have given admission to the prince oftyre but it is to that we owe the moor had every man in his humour been rejected we had never seen volpone perhaps it may not be for the advantage of any nation to have the arts imported from their neighbours in too great perfection this extinguishes emulation and sinks the ardour of the generous youth so many models of italian painting brought into england instead of exciting our artists is the cause of their small progress in that noble art the same perhaps was the case of rome when it received the arts from greece that multitude of polite productions in the french language dispersed all over germany and the north hinder these nations from cultivating their own language and keep them still dependent on their neighbours for those elegant entertainments it is true the ancients had left us models in every kind of writing which are highly worthy of admiration but besides that they were written in languages known only to the learned besides this say the comparison is not so perfect or entire between modern wits and those who lived in so remote an age had waller been born in rome during the reign of tiberius his first productions had been despised when compared to the finished odes of horace but in this island the superiority of the roman poet diminished nothing from the fame of the english we esteemed ourselves sufficiently happy that our climate and language could produce but a faint copy of so excellent an original in short the arts and sciences like some plants require a fresh soil and however rich the land may be and however you may recruit it by art or care it will never when once exhausted produce any thing that is perfect or finished in the kind essay the epicurean it is a great mortification to the vanity of man that his utmost art and industry can never equal the meanest of natures productions either for beauty or value art is only the underworkman and is employed to give a few strokes of embellishment to those pieces which come from the hand of the master some of the drapery may be of his drawing but he is not allowed to touch the principal figure art may make a suit of clothes but nature must produce a man even in those productions commonly denominated works of art we find that the noblest of the kind are beholden for their chief beauty to the force and happy influence of nature to thea native enthusiasm of the poets we owe whatever is admirable in their productions the greatest genius where nature at any time fails him for she is not equal throws aside the lyre and hopes not from the rules of art to reach that divine harmony which must proceed from her inspiration alone how poor are those songs where a happy flow of fancy has not furnished materials for art to embellish and refine but of all the fruitless attempts of art no one is so ridiculous as that which the severe philosophers have undertaken the producing of an artificial happiness and making us be pleased by rules of reason and by reflection why did none of them claim the reward which xerxes promised to him who should invent a new pleasure unless perhaps they invented so many pleasures for their own use that they despised riches and stood in no need of any enjoyments which the rewards of that monarch could procure them am apt indeed to think that they were not willing to furnish the persian court with a new pleasure by presenting it with so new and unusual an object of ridicule their speculations when confined to theory and gravely delivered in the schools of greece might excite admiration in their ignorant pupils but the attempting to reduce such principles to practice would soon have betrayed their absurdity you pretend to make me happy by reason and by rules of art you must then create me anew by rules of art for on my original frame and structure does my happiness depend but you want power to effect this and skill too am afraid nor can entertain a less opinion of natures wisdom than of yours and let her conduct the machine which she has so wisely framed find that should only spoil it by my tampering to what purpose should pretend to regulate refine or invigorate any of those springs or principles which nature has implanted in me is this the road by which must reach happiness but happiness implies ease contentment repose and pleasure not watchfulness care and fatigue the health of my body consists in the facility with which all its operations are performed the stomach digests the aliments the heart circulates the blood the brain separates and refines the spirits and all this without my concerning myself in the matter when by my will alone can stop the blood as it runs with impetuosity along its canals then may hope to change the course of my sentiments and passions in vain should strain my faculties and endeavour to receive pleasure from an object which is not fitted by nature to affect my organs with delight may give myself pain by my fruitless endeavours but shall never reach any pleasure away then with all those vain pretences of making ourselves happy within ourselves of feasting on our own thoughts of being satisfied with the consciousness of welldoing and of despising all assistance and all supplies from external objects this is the voice of pride not of nature and it were well if even this pride could support itself and communicate a real inward pleasure however melancholy or severe but this impotent pride can do no more than regulate the outside and with infinite pains and attention compose the language and countenance to a philosophical dignity in order to deceive the ignorant vulgar the heart mean while is empty of all enjoyment and the mind unsupported by its proper objects sinks into the deepest sorrow and dejection miserable but vain mortal thy mind be happy within itself with what resources is it endowed to fill so immense a void and supply the place of all thy bodily senses and faculties can thy head subsist without thy other members in such a situation what foolish figure must it make do nothing else but sleep and ake into such a lethargy or such a melancholy must thy mind be plunged when deprived of foreign occupations and enjoyments keep me therefore no longer in this violent constraint confine me not within myself but point out to me those objects and pleasures which afford the chief enjoyment but why do apply to you proud and ignorant sages to shew me the road to happiness let me consult my own passions and inclinations in them must read the dictates of nature not in your frivolous discourses but see propitious to my wishes the divine the amiable pleasure the supreme love of gods and men advances towards me at her approach my heart beats with genial heat and every sense and every faculty is dissolved in joy while she pours around me all the embellishments of the spring and all the treasures of the autumn the melody of her voice charms my ears with the softest music as she invites me to partake of those delicious fruits which with a smile that diffuses a glory on the heavens and the earth she presents to me the sportive cupids who attend her or fan me with their odoriferous wings or pour on my head the most fragrant oils or offer me their sparkling nectar in golden goblets o for ever let me spread my limbs on this bed of roses and thus thus feel the delicious moments with soft and downy steps glide along but cruel chance whither do you fly so fast why do my ardent wishes and that load of pleasures under which you labour rather hasten than retard your unrelenting pace suffer me to enjoy this soft repose after all my fatigues in search of happiness suffer me to satiate myself with these delicacies after the pains of so long and so foolish an abstinence but it will not do the roses have lost their hue the fruit its flavour and that delicious wine whose fumes so late intoxicated all my senses with such delight now solicits in vain the sated palate pleasure smiles at my languor she beckons her sister virtue to come to her assistance the gay the frolic virtue observes the call and brings along the whole troop of my jovial friends welcome thrice welcome my ever dear companions to these shady bowers and to this luxurious repast your presence has restored to the rose its hue and to the fruit its flavour the vapours of this sprightly nectar now again play around my heart while you partake of my delights and discover in your chearful looks the pleasure which you receive from my happiness and satisfaction the like do receive from yours and encouraged by your joyous presence shall again renew the feast with which from too much enjoyment my senses were well nigh sated while the mind kept not pace with the body nor afforded relief to her oerburthened partner in our chearful discourses better than in the formal reasonings of the schools is true wisdom to be found in our friendly endearments better than in the hollow debates of statesmen and pretended patriots does true virtue display itself forgetful of the past secure of the future let us here enjoy the present and while we yet possess a being let us fix some good beyond the power of fate or fortune tomorrow will bring its own pleasures along with it or should it disappoint our fond wishes we shall at least enjoy the pleasure of reflecting on the pleasures of today fear not my friends that the barbarous dissonance of bacchus and of his revellers should break in upon this entertainment and confound us with their turbulent and clamorous pleasures the sprightly muses wait around and with their charming symphony sufficient to soften the wolves and tygers of the savage desert inspire a soft joy into every bosom peace harmony and concord reign in this retreat nor is the silence ever broken but by the music of our songs or the chearful accents of our friendly voices but hark the favourite of the muses the gentle damon strikes the lyre and while he accompanies its harmonious notes with his more harmonious song he inspires us with the same happy debauch of fancy by which he is himself transported ye happy youth he sings ye favoured of heaven while the wanton spring pours upon you all her blooming honours let not glory seduce you with her delusive blaze to pass in perils and dangers this delicious season this prime of life wisdom points out to you the road to pleasure nature too beckons you to follow her in that smooth and flowery path will you shut your ears to their commanding voice will you harden your heart to their soft allurements oh deluded mortals thus to lose your youth thus to throw away so invaluable a present to trifle with so perishing a blessing contemplate well your recompence consider that glory which so allures your proud hearts and seduces you with your own praises it is an echo a dream nay the shadow of a dream dissipated by every wind and lost by every contrary breath of the ignorant and illjudging multitude you fear not that even death itself shall ravish it from you but behold while you are yet alive calumny bereaves you of it ignorance neglects it nature enjoys it not fancy alone renouncing every pleasure receives this airy recompence empty and unstable as herself thus the hours pass unperceived along and lead in their wanton train all the pleasures of sense and all the joys of harmony and friendship smiling innocence closes the procession and while she presents herself to our ravished eyes she embellishes the whole scene and renders the view of these pleasures as transporting after they have past us as when with laughing countenances they were yet advancing towards us but the sun has sunk below the horizon and darkness stealing silently upon us has now buried all nature in an universal shade rejoice my friends continue your repast or change it for soft repose though absent your joy or your tranquillity shall still be mine but whither do you go or what new pleasures call you from our society is there aught agreeable without your friends and can aught please in which we partake not yes my friends the joy which now seek admits not of your participation here alone wish your absence and here alone can find a sufficient compensation for the loss of your society but have not advanced far through the shades of the thick wood which spreads a double night around me ere methinks perceive through the gloom the charming cælia the mistress of my wishes who wanders impatient through the grove and preventing the appointed hour silently chides my tardy steps but the joy which she receives from my presence best pleads my excuse and dissipating every anxious and every angry thought leaves room for nought but mutual joy and rapture with what words my fair one shall express my tenderness or describe the emotions which now warm my transported bosom words are too faint to describe my love and if alas you feel not the same flame within you in vain shall endeavour to convey to you a just conception of it but your every word and every motion suffice to remove this doubt and while they express your passion serve also to enflame mine how amiable this solitude this silence this darkness no objects now importune the ravished soul the thought the sense all full of nothing but our mutual happiness wholly possess the mind and convey a pleasure which deluded mortals vainly seek for in every other enjoyment but whyb does your bosom heave with these sighs while tears bathe your glowing cheeks why distract your heart with such vain anxieties why so often ask me how long my love shall yet endure alas my cælia can resolve this question do know how long my life shall yet endure but does this also disturb your tender breast and is the image of our frail mortality for ever present with you to throw a damp on your gayest hours and poison even those joys which love inspires consider rather that if life be frail if youth be transitory we should well employ the present moment and lose no part of so perishable an existence yet a little moment and these shall be no more we shall be as if we had never been not a memory of us be left upon earth and even the fabulous shades below will not afford us a habitation our fruitless anxieties our vain projects our uncertain speculations shall all be swallowed up and lost our present doubts concerning the original cause of all things must never alas be resolved this alone we may be certain of that if any governing mind preside he must be pleased to see us fulfil the ends of our being and enjoy that pleasure for which alone we were created let this reflection give ease to your anxious thoughts but render not your joys too serious by dwelling for ever upon it it is sufficient once to be acquainted with this philosophy in order to give an unbounded loose to love and jollity and remove all the scruples of a vain superstition but while youth and passion my fair one prompt our eager desires we must find gayer subjects of discourse to intermix with these amorous caresses essay the stoic there is this obvious and material difference in the conduct of nature with regard to man and other animals that having endowed the former with a sublime celestial spirit and having given him an affinity with superior beings she allows not such noble faculties to lie lethargic or idle but urges him by necessity to employ on every emergence his utmost art and industry brutecreatures have many of their necessities supplied by nature being cloathed and armed by this beneficent parent of all things and where their own industry is requisite on any occasion nature by implanting instincts still supplies them with the art and guides them to their good by her unerring precepts but man exposed naked and indigent to the rude elements rises slowly from that helpless state by the care and vigilance of his parents and having attained his utmost growth and perfection reaches only a capacity of subsisting by his own care and vigilance every thing is sold to skill and labour and where nature furnishes the materials they are still rude and unfinished till industry ever active and intelligent refines them from their brute state and fits them for human use and convenience acknowledge therefore o man the beneficence of nature for she has given thee that intelligence which supplies all thy necessities but let not indolence under the false appearance of gratitude persuade thee to rest contented with her presents wouldest thou return to the raw herbage for thy food to the open sky for thy covering and to stones and clubs for thy defence against the ravenous animals of the desert then return also to thy savage manners to thy timorous superstition to thy brutal ignorance and sink thyself below those animals whose condition thou admirest and wouldest so fondly imitate thy kind parent nature having given thee art and intelligence has filled the whole globe with materials to employ these talents hearken to her voice which so plainly tells thee that thou thyself shouldest also be the object of thy industry and that by art and attention alone thou canst acquire that ability which will raise thee to thy proper station in the universe behold this artizan who converts a rude and shapeless stone into a noble metal and molding that metal by his cunning hands creates as it were by magic every weapon for his defence and every utensil for his convenience he has not this skill from nature use and practice have taught it him and if thou wouldest emulate his success thou must follow his laborious footsteps but while thou ambitiously aspirest to perfecting thy bodily powers and faculties wouldest thou meanly neglect thy mind and from a preposterous sloth leave it still rude and uncultivated as it came from the hands of nature far be such folly and negligence from every rational being if nature has been frugal in her gifts and endowments there is the more need of art to supply her defects if she has been generous and liberal know that she still expects industry and application on our part and revenges herself in proportion to our negligent ingratitude the richest genius like the most fertile soil when uncultivated shoots up into the rankest weeds and instead of vines and olives for the pleasure and use of man produces to its slothful owner the most abundant crop of poisons the great end of all human industry is the attainment of happiness for this were arts invented sciences cultivated laws ordained and societies modelled by the most profound wisdom of patriots and legislators even the lonely savage who lies exposed to the inclemency of the elements and the fury of wild beasts forgets not for a moment this grand object of his being ignorant as he is of every art of life he still keeps in view the end of all those arts and eagerly seeks for felicity amidst that darkness with which he is environed but as much as the wildest savage is inferior to the polished citizen who under the protection of laws enjoys every convenience which industry has invented so much is this citizen himself inferior to the man of virtue and the true philosopher who governs his appetites subdues his passions and has learned from reason to set a just value on every pursuit and enjoyment for is there an art and apprenticeship necessary for every other attainment and is there no art of life no rule no precepts to direct us in this principal concern can no particular pleasure be attained without skill and can the whole be regulated without reflection or intelligence by the blind guidance of appetite and instinct surely then no mistakes are ever committed in this affair but every man however dissolute and negligent proceeds in the pursuit of happiness with as unerring a motion as that which the celestial bodies observe when conducted by the hand of the almighty they roll along the ethereal plains but if mistakes be often be inevitably committed let us register these mistakes let us consider their causes let us weigh their importance let us enquire for their remedies when from this we have fixed all the rules of conduct we are philosophers when we have reduced these rules to practice we are sages like many subordinate artists employed to form the several wheels and springs of a machine such are those who excel in all the particular arts of life he is the master workman who puts those several parts together moves them according to just harmony and proportion and produces true felicity as the result of their conspiring order while thou hast such an alluring object in view shall that labour and attention requisite to the attainment of thy end ever seem burdensome and intolerable know that this labour itself is the chief ingredient of the felicity to which thou aspirest and that every enjoyment soon becomes insipid and distasteful when not acquired by fatigue and industry see the hardy hunters rise from their downy couches shake off the slumbers which still weigh down their heavy eyelids and ere aurora has yet covered the heavens with her flaming mantle hasten to the forest they leave behind in their own houses and in the neighbouring plains animals of every kind whose flesh furnishes the most delicious fare and which offer themselves to the fatal stroke laborious man disdains so easy a purchase he seeks for a prey which hides itself from his search or flies from his pursuit or defends itself from his violence having exerted in the chace every passion of the mind and every member of the body he then finds the charms of repose and with joy compares its pleasures to those of his engaging labours and can vigorous industry give pleasure to the pursuit even of the most worthless prey which frequently escapes our toils and cannot the same industry render the cultivating of our mind the moderating of our passions the enlightening of our reason an agreeable occupation while we are every day sensible of our progress and behold our inward features and countenance brightening incessantly with new charms begin by curing yourself of this lethargic indolence the task is not difficult you need but taste the sweets of honest labour proceed to learn the just value of every pursuit long study is not requisite compare though but for once the mind to the body virtue to fortune and glory to pleasure you will then perceive the advantages of industry you will then be sensible what are the proper objects of your industry in vain do you seek repose from beds of roses in vain do you hope for enjoyment from the most delicious wines and fruits your indolence itself becomes a fatigue your pleasure itself creates disgust the mind unexercised finds every delight insipid and loathsome and ere yet the body full of noxious humours feels the torment of its multiplied diseases your nobler part is sensible of the invading poison and seeks in vain to relieve its anxiety by new pleasures which still augment the fatal malady need not tell you that by this eager pursuit of pleasure you more and more expose yourself to fortune and accidents and rivet your affections on external objects which chance may in a moment ravish from you shall suppose that your indulgent stars favour you still with the enjoyment of your riches and possessions prove to you that even in the midst of your luxurious pleasures you are unhappy and that by too much indulgence you are incapable of enjoying what prosperous fortune still allows you to possess but surely the instability of fortune is a consideration not to be overlooked or neglected happiness cannot possibly exist where there is no security and security can have no place where fortune has any dominion though that unstable deity should not exert her rage against you the dread of it would still torment you would disturb your slumbers haunt your dreams and throw a damp on the jollity of your most delicious banquets the temple of wisdom is seated on a rock above the rage of the fighting elements and inaccessible to all the malice of man the rolling thunder breaks below and those more terrible instruments of human fury reach not to so sublime a height the sage while he breathes that serene air looks down with pleasure mixed with compassion on the errors of mistaken mortals who blindly seek for the true path of life and pursue riches nobility honour or power for genuine felicity the greater part he beholds disappointed of their fond wishes some lament that having once possessed the object of their desires it is ravished from them by envious fortune and all complain that even their own vows though granted cannot give them happiness or relieve the anxiety of their distracted minds but does the sage always preserve himself in this philosophical indifference and rest contented with lamenting the miseries of mankind without ever employing himself for their relief does he constantly indulge this severe wisdom which by pretending to elevate him above human accidents does in reality harden his heart and render him careless of the interests of mankind and of society no he knows that in this sullen apathy neither true wisdom nor true happiness can be found he feels too strongly the charm of the social affections ever to counteract so sweet so natural so virtuous a propensity even when bathed in tears he laments the miseries of human race of his country of his friends and unable to give succour can only relieve them by compassion he yet rejoices in the generous disposition and feels a satisfaction superior to that of the most indulged sense so engaging are the sentiments of humanity that they brighten up the very face of sorrow and operate like the sun which shining on a dusky cloud or falling rain paints on them the most glorious colours which are to be found in the whole circle of nature but it is not here alone that the social virtues display their energy with whatever ingredient you mix them they are still predominant as sorrow cannot overcome them so neither can sensual pleasure obscure them the joys of love however tumultuous banish not the tender sentiments of sympathy and affection they even derive their chief influence from that generous passion and when presented alone afford nothing to the unhappy mind but lassitude and disgust behold this sprightly debauchee who professes a contempt of all other pleasures but those of wine and jollity separate him from his companions like a spark from a fire where before it contributed to the general blaze his alacrity suddenly extinguishes and though surrounded with every other means of delight he lothes the sumptuous banquet and prefers even the most abstracted study and speculation as more agreeable and entertaining but the social passions never afford such transporting pleasures or make so glorious an appearance in the eyes both of god and man as when shaking off every earthly mixture they associate themselves with the sentiments of virtue and prompt us to laudable and worthy actions as harmonious colours mutually give and receive a lustre by their friendly union so do these ennobling sentiments of the human mind see the triumph of nature in parental affection what selfish passion what sensual delight is a match for it whether a man exults in the prosperity and virtue of his offspring or flies to their succour through the most threatening and tremendous dangers proceed still in purifying the generous passion you will still the more admire its shining glories what charms are there in the harmony of minds and in a friendship founded on mutual esteem and gratitude what satisfaction in relieving the distressed in comforting the afflicted in raising the fallen and in stopping the career of cruel fortune or of more cruel man in their insults over the good and virtuous but what supreme joy in the victories over vice as well as misery when by virtuous example or wise exhortation our fellowcreatures are taught to govern their passions reform their vices and subdue their worst enemies which inhabit within their own bosoms but these objects are still too limited for the human mind which being of celestial origin swells with the divinest and most enlarged affections and carrying its attention beyond kindred and acquaintance extends its benevolent wishes to the most distant posterity it views liberty and laws as the source of human happiness and devotes itself with the utmost alacrity to their guardianship and protection toils dangers death itself carry their charms when we brave them for the public good and ennoble that being which we generously sacrifice for the interests of our country happy the man whom indulgent fortune allows to pay to virtue what he owes to nature and to make a generous gift of what must otherwise be ravished from him by cruel necessity in the true sage and patriot are united whatever can distinguish human nature or elevate mortal man to a resemblance with the divinity the softest benevolence the most undaunted resolution the tenderest sentiments the most sublime love of virtue all these animate successively his transported bosom what satisfaction when he looks within to find the most turbulent passions tuned to just harmony and concord and every jarring sound banished from this enchanting music if the contemplation even of inanimate beauty is so delightful if it ravishes the senses even when the fair form is foreign to us what must be the effects of moral beauty and what influence must it have when it embellishes our own mind and is the result of our own reflection and industry but where is the reward of virtue and what recompence has nature provided for such important sacrifices as those of life and fortune which we must often make to it oh sons of earth are ye ignorant of the value of this celestial mistress and do ye meanly enquire for her portion when ye observe her genuine charms but know that nature has been indulgent to human weakness and has not left this favourite child naked and unendowed she has provided virtue with the richest dowry but being careful lest the allurements of interest should engage such suitors as were insensible of the native worth of so divine a beauty she has wisely provided that this dowry can have no charms but in the eyes of those who are already transported with the love of virtue glory is the portion of virtue the sweet reward of honourable toils the triumphant crown which covers the thoughtful head of the disinterested patriot or the dusty brow of the victorious warrior elevated by so sublime a prize the man of virtue looks down with contempt on all the allurements of pleasure and all the menaces of danger death itself loses its terrors when he considers that its dominion extends only over a part of him and that in spite of death and time the rage of the elements and the endless vicissitude of human affairs he is assured of an immortal fame among all the sons of men there surely is a being who presides over the universe and who with infinite wisdom and power has reduced the jarring elements into just order and proportion let speculative reasoners dispute how far this beneficent being extends his care and whether he prolongs our existence beyond the grave in order to bestow on virtue its just reward and render it fully triumphant the man of morals without deciding any thing on so dubious a subject is satisfied with the portion marked out to him by the supreme disposer of all things gratefully he accepts of that farther reward prepared for him but if disappointed he thinks not virtue an empty name but justly esteeming it its own reward he gratefully acknowledges the bounty of his creator who by calling him into existence has thereby afforded him an opportunity of once acquiring so invaluable a possession essay the platonist to some philosophers it appears matter of surprize that all mankind possessing the same nature and being endowed with the same faculties should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations and that one should utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by another to some it appears matter of still more surprize that a man should differ so widely from himself at different times and after possession reject with disdain what before was the object of all his vows and wishes to me this feverish uncertainty and irresolution in human conduct seems altogether unavoidable nor can a rational soul made for the contemplation of the supreme being and of his works ever enjoy tranquillity or satisfaction while detained in the ignoble pursuits of sensual pleasure or popular applause the divinity is a boundless ocean of bliss and glory human minds are smaller streams which arising at first from this ocean seek still amid all their wanderings to return to it and to lose themselves in that immensity of perfection when checked in this natural course by vice or folly they become furious and enraged and swelling to a torrent do then spread horror and devastation on the neighbouring plains in vain by pompous phrase and passionate expression each recommends his own pursuit and invites the credulous hearers to an imitation of his life and manners the heart belies the countenance and sensibly feels even amid the highest success the unsatisfactory nature of all those pleasures which detain it from its true object examine the voluptuous man before enjoyment measure the vehemence of his desire and the importance of his object find that all his happiness proceeds only from that hurry of thought which takes him from himself and turns his view from his guilt and misery consider him a moment after he has now enjoyed the pleasure which he fondly sought after the sense of his guilt and misery returns upon him with double anguish his mind tormented with fear and remorse his body depressed with disgust and satiety but a more august at least a more haughty personage presents himself boldly to our censure and assuming the title of a philosopher and man of morals offers to submit to the most rigid examination he challenges with a visible though concealed impatience our approbation and applause and seems offended that we should hesitate a moment before we break out into admiration of his virtue seeing this impatience hesitate still more begin to examine the motives of his seeming virtue but behold ere can enter upon this enquiry he flings himself from me and addressing his discourse to that crowd of heedless auditors fondly abuses them by his magnificent pretensions o philosopher thy wisdom is vain and thy virtue unprofitable thou seekest the ignorant applauses of men not the solid reflections of thy own conscience or the more solid approbation of that being who with one regard of his allseeing eye penetrates the universe thou surely art conscious of the hollowness of thy pretended probity whilst calling thyself a citizen a son a friend thou forgettest thy higher sovereign thy true father thy greatest benefactor where is the adoration due to infinite perfection whence every thing good and valuable is derived where is the gratitude owing to thy creator who called thee forth from nothing who placed thee in all these relations to thy fellowcreatures and requiring thee to fulfil the duty of each relation forbids thee to neglect what thou owest to himself the most perfect being to whom thou art connected by the closest tye but thou art thyself thy own idol thou worshippest thy imaginary perfections or rather sensible of thy real imperfections thou seekest only to deceive the world and to please thy fancy by multiplying thy ignorant admirers thus not content with neglecting what is most excellent in the universe thou desirest to substitute in his place what is most vile and contemptible consider all the works of mens hands all the inventions of human wit in which thou affectest so nice a discernment thou wilt find that the most perfect production still proceeds from the most perfect thought and that it is mind alone which we admire while we bestow our applause on the graces of a wellproportioned statue or the symmetry of a noble pile the statuary the architect comes still in view and makes us reflect on the beauty of his art and contrivance which from a heap of unformed matter could extract such expressions and proportions this superior beauty of thought and intelligence thou thyself acknowledgest while thou invitest us to contemplate in thy conduct the harmony of affections the dignity of sentiments and all those graces of a mind which chiefly merit our attention but why stoppest thou short seest thou nothing farther that is valuable amid thy rapturous applauses of beauty and order art thou still ignorant where is to be found the most consummate beauty the most perfect order compare the works of art with those of nature the one are but imitations of the other the nearer art approaches to nature the more perfect is it esteemed but still how wide are its nearest approaches and what an immense interval may be observed between them art copies only the outside of nature leaving the inward and more admirable springs and principles as exceeding her imitation as beyond her comprehension art copies only the minute productions of nature despairing to reach that grandeur and magnificence which are so astonishing in the masterly works of her original can we then be so blind as not to discover an intelligence and a design in the exquisite and most stupendous contrivance of the universe can we be so stupid as not to feel the warmest raptures of worship and adoration upon the contemplation of that intelligent being so infinitely good and wise the most perfect happiness surely must arise from the contemplation of the most perfect object but what more perfect than beauty and virtue and where is beauty to be found equal to that of the universe or virtue which can be compared to the benevolence and justice of the deity if aught can diminish the pleasure of this contemplation it must be either the narrowness of our faculties which conceals from us the greatest part of these beauties and perfections or the shortness of our lives which allows not time sufficient to instruct us in them but it is our comfort that if we employ worthily the faculties here assigned us they will be enlarged in another state of existence so as to render us more suitable worshippers of our maker and that the task which can never be finished in time will be the business of an eternity essay the sceptic have long entertained a suspicion with regard to the decisions of philosophers upon all subjects and found in myself a greater inclination to dispute than assent to their conclusions there is one mistake to which they seem liable almost without exception they confine too much their principles and make no account of that vast variety which nature has so much affected in all her operations when a philosopher has once laid hold of a favourite principle which perhaps accounts for many natural effects he extends the same principle over the whole creation and reduces to it every phænomenon though by the most violent and absurd reasoning our own mind being narrow and contracted we cannot extend our conception to the variety and extent of nature but imagine that she is as much bounded in her operations as we are in our speculation but if ever this infirmity of philosophers is to be suspected on any occasion it is in their reasonings concerning human life and the methods of attaining happiness in that case they are led astray not only by the narrowness of their understandings but by that also of their passions almost every one has a predominant inclination to which his other desires and affections submit and which governs him though perhaps with some intervals through the whole course of his life it is difficult for him to apprehend that any thing which appears totally indifferent to him can ever give enjoyment to any person or can possess charms which altogether escape his observation his own pursuits are always in his account the most engaging the objects of his passion the most valuable and the road which he pursues the only one that leads to happiness but would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment there are many obvious instances and arguments sufficient to undeceive them and make them enlarge their maxims and principles do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour do they not feel in themselves that what pleases at one time displeases at another by the change of inclination and that it is not in their power by their utmost efforts to recall that taste or appetite which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable what is the meaning therefore of those general preferences of the town or country life of a life of action or one of pleasure of retirement or society when besides the different inclinations of different men every ones experience may convince him that each of these kinds of life is agreeable in its turn and that their variety or their judicious mixture chiefly contributes to the rendering all of them agreeable but shall this business be allowed to go altogether at adventures and must a man consult only his humour and inclination in order to determine his course of life without employing his reason to inform him what road is preferable and leads most surely to happiness is there no difference then between one mans conduct and another answer there is a great difference one man following his inclination in chusing his course of life may employ much surer means for succeeding than another who is led by his inclination into the same course of life and pursues the same object are riches the chief object of your desires acquire skill in your profession be diligent in the exercise of it enlarge the circle of your friends and acquaintance avoid pleasure and expence and never be generous but with a view of gaining more than you could save by frugality would you acquire the public esteem guard equally against the extremes of arrogance and fawning let it appear that you set a value upon yourself but without despising others if you fall into either of the extremes you either provoke mens pride by your insolence or teach them to despise you by your timorous submission and by the mean opinion which you seem to entertain of yourself these you say are the maxims of common prudence and discretion what every parent inculcates on his child and what every man of sense pursues in the course of life which he has chosenwhat is it then you desire more do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man to learn something by magic or witchcraft beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretionyes we come to a philosopher to be instructed how we shall chuse our ends more than the means for attaining these ends we want to know what desire we shall gratify what passion we shall comply with what appetite we shall indulge as to the rest we trust to common sense and the general maxims of the world for our instruction am sorry then have pretended to be a philosopher for find your questions very perplexing and am in danger if my answer be too rigid and severe of passing for a pedant and scholastic if it be too easy and free of being taken for a preacher of vice and immorality however to satisfy you shall deliver my opinion upon the matter and shall only desire you to esteem it of as little consequence as do myself by that means you will neither think it worthy of your ridicule nor your anger if we can depend upon any principle which we learn from philosophy this think may be considered as certain and undoubted that there is nothing in itself valuable or despicable desirable or hateful beautiful or deformed but that these attributes arise from the particular constitution and fabric of human sentiment and affection what seems the most delicious food to one animal appears loathsome to another what affects the feeling of one with delight produces uneasiness in another this is confessedly the case with regard to all the bodily senses but if we examine the matter more accurately we shall find that the same observation holds even where the mind concurs with the body and mingles its sentiment with the exterior appetite desire this passionate lover to give you a character of his mistress he will tell you that he is at a loss for words to describe her charms and will ask you very seriously if ever you were acquainted with a goddess or an angel if you answer that you never were he will then say that it is impossible for you to form a conception of such divine beauties as those which his charmer possesses so complete a shape such wellonline library of liberty essays moral political literary lf ed proportioned features so engaging an air such sweetness of disposition such gaiety of humour you can infer nothing however from all this discourse but that the poor man is in love and that the general appetite between the sexes which nature has infused into all animals is in him determined to a particular object by some qualities which give him pleasure the same divine creature not only to a different animal but also to a different man appears a mere mortal being and is beheld with the utmost indifference nature has given all animals a like prejudice in favour of their offspring as soon as the helpless infant sees the light though in every other eye it appears a despicable and a miserable creature it is regarded by its fond parent with the utmost affection and is preferred to every other object however perfect and accomplished the passion alone arising from the original structure and formation of human nature bestows a value on the most insignificant object we may push the same observation further and may conclude that even when the mind operates alone and feeling the sentiment of blame or approbation pronounces one object deformed and odious another beautiful and amiable say that even in this case those qualities are not really in the objects but belong entirely to the sentiment of that mind which blames or praises grant that it will be more difficult to make this proposition evident and as it were palpable to negligent thinkers because nature is more uniform in the sentiments of the mind than in most feelings of the body and produces a nearer resemblance in the inward than in the outward part of human kind there is something approaching to principles in mental taste and critics can reason and dispute more plausibly than cooks or perfumers we may observe however that this uniformity among human kind hinders not but that there is a considerable diversity in the sentiments of beauty and worth and that education custom prejudice caprice and humour frequently vary our taste of this kind you will never convince a man who is not accustomed to italian music and has not an ear to follow its intricacies that a scotch tune is not preferable you have not even any single argument beyond your own taste which you can employ in your behalf and to your antagonist his particular taste will always appear a more convincing argument to the contrary if you be wise each of you will allow that the other may be in the right and having many other instances of this diversity of taste you will both confess that beauty and worth are merely of a relative nature and consist in an agreeable sentiment produced by an object in a particular mind according to the peculiar structure and constitution of that mind by this diversity of sentiment observable in human kind nature has perhaps intended to make us sensible of her authority and let us see what surprizing changes she could produce on the passions and desires of mankind merely by the change of their inward fabric without any alteration on the objects the vulgar may even be convinced by this argument but men accustomed to thinking may draw a more convincing at least a more general argument from the very nature of the subject in the operation of reasoning the mind does nothing but run over its objects as they are supposed to stand in reality without adding any thing to them or diminishing any thing from them if examine the ptolomaic and copernican systems endeavour only by my enquiries to know the real situation of the planets that is in other words endeavour to give them in my conception the same relations that they bear towards each other in the heavens to this operation of the mind therefore there seems to be always a real though often an unknown standard in the nature of things nor is truth or falsehood variable by the various apprehensions of mankind though all human race should for ever conclude that the sun moves and the earth remains at rest the sun stirs not an inch from his place for all these reasonings and such conclusions are eternally false and erroneous but the case is not the same with the qualities of beautiful and deformed desirable and odious as with truth and falsehood in the former case the mind is not content with merely surveying its objects as they stand in themselves it also feels a sentiment of delight or uneasiness approbation or blame consequent to that survey and this sentiment determines it to affix the epithet beautiful or deformed desirable or odious now it is evident that this sentiment must depend upon the particular fabric or structure of the mind which enables such particular forms to operate in such a particular manner and produces a sympathy or conformity between the mind and its objects vary the structure of the mind or inward organs the sentiment no longer follows though the form remains the same the sentiment being different from the object and arising from its operation upon the organs of the mind an alteration upon the latter must vary the effect nor can the same object presented to a mind totally different produce the same sentiment this conclusion every one is apt to draw of himself without much philosophy where the sentiment is evidently distinguishable from the object who is not sensible that power and glory and vengeance are not desirable of themselves but derive all their value from the structure of human passions which begets a desire towards such particular pursuits but with regard to beauty either natural or moral the case is commonly supposed to be different the agreeable quality is thought to lie in the object not in the sentiment and that merely because the sentiment is not so turbulent and violent as to distinguish itself in an evident manner from the perception of the object but a little reflection suffices to distinguish them a man may know exactly all the circles and ellipses of the copernican system and all the irregular spirals of the ptolomaic without perceiving that the former is more beautiful than the latter euclid has fully explained every quality of the circle but has not in any proposition said a word of its beauty the reason is evident beauty is not a quality of the circle it lies not in any part of the line whose parts are all equally distant from a common center it is only the effect which that figure produces upon a mind whose particular fabric or structure renders it susceptible of such sentiments in vain would you look for it in the circle or seek it either by your senses or by mathematical reasonings in all the properties of that figure the mathematician who took no other pleasure in reading virgil but that of examining eneass voyage by the map might perfectly understand the meaning of every latin word employed by that divine author and consequently might have a distinct idea of the whole narration he would even have a more distinct idea of it than they could attain who had not studied so exactly the geography of the poem he knew therefore every thing in the poem but he was ignorant of its beauty because the beauty properly speaking lies not in the poem but in the sentiment or taste of the reader and where a man has no such delicacy of temper as to make him feel this sentiment he must be ignorant of the beauty though possessed of the science and understanding of an angel the inference upon the whole is that it is not from the value or worth of the object which any person pursues that we can determine his enjoyment but merely from the passion with which he pursues it and the success which he meets with in his pursuit objects have absolutely no worth or value in themselves they derive their worth merely from the passion if that be strong and steady and successful the person is happy it cannot reasonably be doubted but a little miss dressed in a new gown for a dancingschool ball receives as compleat enjoyment as the greatest orator who triumphs in the spendor of his eloquence while he governs the passions and resolutions of a numerous assembly all the difference therefore between one man and another with regard to life consists either in the passion or in the enjoyment and these differences are sufficient to produce the wide extremes of happiness and misery to be happy the passion must neither be too violent nor too remiss in the first case the mind is in a perpetual hurry and tumult in the second it sinks into a disagreeable indolence and lethargy to be happy the passion must be benign and social not rough or fierce the affections of the latter kind are not near so agreeable to the feeling as those of the former who will compare rancour and animosity envy and revenge to friendship benignity clemency and gratitude to be happy the passion must be chearful and gay not gloomy and melancholy a propensity to hope and joy is real riches one to fear and sorrow real poverty some passions or inclinations in the enjoyment of their object are not so steady or constant as others nor convey such durable pleasure and satisfaction philosophical devotion for instance like the enthusiasm of a poet is the transitory effect of high spirits great leisure a fine genius and a habit of study and contemplation but notwithstanding all these circumstances an abstract invisible object like that which natural religion alone presents to us cannot long actuate the mind or be of any moment in life to render the passion of continuance we must find some method of affecting the senses and imagination and must embrace some historical as well as philosophical account of the divinity popular superstitions and observances are even found to be of use in this particular though the tempers of men be very different yet we may safely pronounce in general that a life of pleasure cannot support itself so long as one of business but is much more subject to satiety and disgust the amusements which are the most durable have all a mixture of application and attention in them such as gaming and hunting and in general business and action fill up all the great vacancies in human life but where the temper is the best disposed for any enjoyment the object is often wanting and in this respect the passions which pursue external objects contribute not so much to happiness as those which rest in ourselves since we are neither so certain of attaining such objects nor so secure in possessing them a passion for learning is preferable with regard to happiness to one for riches some men are possessed of great strength of mind and even when they pursue external objects are not much affected by a disappointment but renew their application and industry with the greatest chearfulness nothing contributes more to happiness than such a turn of mind according to this short and imperfect sketch of human life the happiest disposition of mind is the virtuous or in other words that which leads to action and employment renders us sensible to the social passions steels the heart against the assaults of fortune reduces the affections to a just moderation makes our own thoughts an entertainment to us and inclines us rather to the pleasures of society and conversation than to those of the senses this in the mean time must be obvious to the most careless reasoner that all dispositions of mind are not alike favourable to happiness and that one passion or humour may be extremely desirable while another is equally disagreeable and indeed all the difference between the conditions of life depends upon the mind nor is there any one situation of affairs in itself preferable to another good and ill both natural and moral are entirely relative to human sentiment and affection no man would ever be unhappy could he alter his feelings proteuslike he would elude all attacks by the continual alterations of his shape and form but of this resource nature has in a great measure deprived us the fabric and constitution of our mind no more depends on our choice than that of our body the generality of men have not even the smallest notion that any alteration in this respect can ever be desirable as a stream necessarily follows the several inclinations of the ground on which it runs so are the ignorant and thoughtless part of mankind actuated by their natural propensities such are effectually excluded from all pretensions to philosophy and the medicine of the mind so much boasted but even upon the wise and thoughtful nature has a prodigious influence nor is it always in a mans power by the utmost art and industry to correct his temper and attain that virtuous character to which he aspires the empire of philosophy extends over a few and with regard to these too her authority is very weak and limited men may well be sensible of the value of virtue and may desire to attain it but it is not always certain that they will be successful in their wishes whoever considers without prejudice the course of human actions will find that mankind are almost entirely guided by constitution and temper and that general maxims have little influence but so far as they affect our taste or sentiment if a man have a lively sense of honour and virtue with moderate passions his conduct will always be conformable to the rules of morality or if he depart from them his return will be easy and expeditious on the other hand where one is born of so perverse a frame of mind of so callous and insensible a disposition as to have no relish for virtue and humanity no sympathy with his fellowcreatures no desire of esteem and applause such a one must be allowed entirely incurable nor is there any remedy in philosophy he reaps no satisfaction but from low and sensual objects or from the indulgence of malignant passions he feels no remorse to controul his vicious inclinations he has not even that sense or taste which is requisite to make him desire a better character for my part know not how should address myself to such a one or by what arguments should endeavour to reform him should tell him of the inward satisfaction which results from laudable and humane actions the delicate pleasure of disinterested love and friendship the lasting enjoyments of a good name and an established character he might still reply that these were perhaps pleasures to such as were susceptible of them but that for his part he finds himself of a quite different turn and disposition must repeat it my philosophy affords no remedy in such a case nor could do any thing but lament this persons unhappy condition but then ask if any other philosophy can afford a remedy or if it be possible by any system to render all mankind virtuous however perverse may be their natural frame of mind experience will soon convince us of the contrary and will venture to affirm that perhaps the chief benefit which results from philosophy arises in an indirect mannera and proceeds more from its secret insensible influence than from its immediate application it is certain that a serious attention to the sciences and liberal arts softens and humanizes the temper and cherishes those fine emotions in which true virtue and honour consists it rarely very rarely happens that a man of taste and learning is not at least an honest man whatever frailties may attend him the bent of his mind to speculative studies must mortify in him the passions of interest and ambition and must at the same time give him a greater sensibility of all the decencies and duties of life he feels more fully a moral distinction in characters and manners nor is his sense of this kind diminished but on the contrary it is much encreased by speculation besides such insensible changes upon the temper and disposition it is highly probable that others may be produced by study and application the prodigious effects of education may convince us that the mind is not altogether stubborn and inflexible but will admit of many alterations from its original make and structure let a man propose to himself the model of a character which he approves let him be well acquainted with those particulars in which his own character deviates from this model let him keep a constant watch over himself and bend his mind by a continual effort from the vices towards the virtues and doubt not but in time he will find in his temper an alteration for the better habit is another powerful means of reforming the mind and implanting in it good dispositions and inclinations a man who continues in a course of sobriety and temperance will hate riot and disorder if he engage in business or study indolence will seem a punishment to him if he constrain himself to practise beneficence and affability he will soon abhor all instances of pride and violence where one is thoroughly convinced that the virtuous course of life is preferable if he have but resolution enough for some time to impose a violence on himself his reformation needs not be despaired of the misfortune is that this conviction and this resolution never can have place unless a man be beforehand tolerably virtuous here then is the chief triumph of art and philosophy it insensibly refines the temper and it points out to us those dispositions which we should endeavour to attain by a constant bent of mind and by repeated habit beyond this cannot acknowledge it to have great influence and must entertain doubts concerning all those exhortations and consolations which are in such vogue among speculative reasoners we have already observed that no objects are in themselves desirable or odious valuable or despicable but that objects acquire these qualities from the particular character and constitution of the mind which surveys them to diminish therefore or augment any persons value for an object to excite or moderate his passions there are no direct arguments or reasons which can be employed with any force or influence the catching of flies like domitian if it give more pleasure is preferable to the hunting of wild beasts like william rufus or conquering of kingdoms like alexander but though the value of every object can be determined only by the sentiment or passion of every individual we may observe that the passion in pronouncing its verdict considers not the object simply as it is in itself but surveys it with all the circumstances which attend it a man transported with joy on account of his possessing a diamond confines not his view to the glistering stone before him he also considers its rarity and thence chiefly arises his pleasure and exultation here therefore a philosopher may step in and suggest particular views and considerations and circumstances which otherwise would have escaped us and by that means he may either moderate or excite any particular passion it may seem unreasonable absolutely to deny the authority of philosophy in this respect but it must be confessed that there lies this strong presumption against it that if these views be natural and obvious they would have occurred of themselves without the assistance of philosophy if they be not natural they never can have any influence on the affections these are of a very delicate nature and cannot be forced or constrained by the utmost art or industry a consideration which we seek for on purpose which we enter into with difficulty which we cannot retain without care and attention will never produce those genuine and durable movements of passion which are the result of nature and the constitution of the mind a man may as well pretend to cure himself of love by viewing his mistress through the artificial medium of a microscope or prospect and beholding there the coarseness of her skin and monstrous disproportion of her features as hope to excite or moderate any passion by the artificial arguments of a seneca or an epictetus the remembrance of the natural aspect and situation of the object will in both cases still recur upon him the reflections of philosophy are too subtile and distant to take place in common life or eradicate any affection the air is too fine to breathe in where it is above the winds and clouds of the atmosphere another defect of those refined reflections which philosophy suggests to us is that commonly they cannot diminish or extinguish our vicious passions without diminishing or extinguishing such as are virtuous and rendering the mind totally indifferent and unactive they are for the most part general and are applicable to all our affections in vain do we hope to direct their influence only to one side if by incessant study and meditation we have rendered them intimate and present to us they will operate throughout and spread an universal insensibility over the mind when we destroy the nerves we extinguish the sense of pleasure together with that of pain in the human body it will be easy by one glance of the eye to find one or other of these defects in most of those philosophical reflections so much celebrated both in ancient and modern times let not the injuries or violence of men say the philosophersever discompose you by anger or hatred would you be angry at the ape for its malice or the tyger for its ferocity this reflection leads us into a bad opinion of human nature and must extinguish the social affections it tends also to prevent all remorse for a mans own crimes when he considers that vice is as natural to mankind as the particular instincts to brutecreatures all ills arise from the order of the universe which is absolutely perfect would you wish to disturb so divine an order for the sake of your own particular interest what if the ills suffer arise from malice or oppression but the vices and imperfections of men are also comprehended in the order of the universe if plagues and earthquakes break not heavns design why then aborgiaor acatiline let this be allowed and my own vices will also be a part of the same order to one who said that none were happy who were not above opinion a spartan replied then none are happy but knaves and robbers b man is born to be miserable and is he surprized at any particular misfortune and can he give way to sorrow and lamentation upon account of any disaster yes he very reasonably laments that he should be born to be miserable your consolation presents a hundred ills for one of which you pretend to ease him you should always have before your eyes death disease poverty blindness exile calumny and infamy as ills which are incident to human nature if any one of these ills falls to your lot you will bear it the better when you have reckoned upon it answer if we confine ourselves to a general and distant reflection on the ills of human life that can have no effect to prepare us for them if by close and intense meditation we render them present and intimate to us that is the true secret for poisoning all our pleasures and rendering us perpetually miserable your sorrow is fruitless and will not change the course of destiny very true and for that very reason am sorry ciceros consolation for deafness is somewhat curious how many languages are there says he which you do not understand thepunic spanish gallic ægyptian c with regard to all these you are as if you were deaf

his blindness what says he do you think there are no pleasures in the dark nothing can be more destructive says fontenelleto ambition and the passion for conquest than the true system of astronomy what a poor thing is even the whole globe in comparison of the infinite extent of nature this consideration is evidently too distant ever to have any effect or if it had any would it not destroy patriotism as well as ambition the same gallant author adds with some reason that the bright eyes of the ladies are the only objects which lose nothing of their lustre or value from the most extensive views of astronomy but stand proof against every system would philosophers advise us to limit our affection to them cexile says plutarch to a friend in banishment is no evil mathematicians tell us that the whole earth is but a point compared to the heavens to change ones country then is little more than to remove from one street to another man is not a plant rooted to a certain spot of earth all soils and all climates are alike suited to him these topics are admirable could they fall only into the hands of banished persons but what if they come also to the knowledge of those who are employed in public affairs and destroy all their attachment to their native country or will they operate like the quacks medicine which is equally good for a diabetes and a dropsy it is certain were a superior being thrust into a human body that the whole of life would to him appear so mean contemptible and puerile that he never could be induced to take part in any thing and would scarcely give attention to what passes around him to engage him to such a condescension as to play even the part of a philip with zeal and alacrity would be much more difficult than to constrain the same philip after having been a king and a conqueror during fifty years to mend old shoes with proper care and attention the occupation which lucian assigns him in the infernal regions now all the same topics of disdain towards human affairs which could operate on this supposed being occur also to a philosopher but being in some measure disproportioned to human capacity and not being fortified by the experience of any thing better they make not a full impression on him he sees but he feels not sufficiently their truth and is always a sublime philosopher when he needs not that is as long as nothing disturbs him or rouzes his affections while others play he wonders at their keenness and ardour but he no sooner puts in his own stake than he is commonly transported with the same passions that he had so much condemned while he remained a simple spectator there are two considerations chiefly to be met with in books of philosophy from which any important effect is to be expected and that because these considerations are drawn from common life and occur upon the most superficial view of human affairs when we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty of life how despicable seem all our pursuits of happiness and even if we would extend our concern beyond our own life how frivolous appear our most enlarged and most generous projects when we consider the incessant changes and revolutions of human affairs by which laws and learning books and governments are hurried away by time as by a rapid stream and are lost in the immense ocean of matter such a reflection certainly tends to mortify all our passions but does it not thereby counterwork the artifice of nature who has happily deceived us into an opinion that human life is of some importance and may not such a reflection be employed with success by voluptuous reasoners in order to lead us from the paths of action and virtue into the flowery fields of indolence and pleasure we are informed by thucydides that during the famous plague of athens when death seemed present to every one a dissolute mirth and gaiety prevailed among the people who exhorted one another to make the most of life as long as it endured the same observation is made by boccace with regard to the plague of florence d a like principle makes soldiers during war be more addicted to riot and expence than any other race of men present pleasure is always of importance and whatever diminishes the importance of all other objects must bestow on it an additional influence and valuee the second philosophical consideration which may often have an influence on the affections is derived from a comparison of our own condition with the condition of others this comparison we are continually making even in common life but the misfortune is that we are rather apt to compare our situation with that of our superiors than with that of our inferiors a philosopher corrects this natural infirmity by turning his view to the other side in order to render himself easy in the situation to which fortune has confined him there are few people who are not susceptible of some consolation from this reflection though to a very goodnatured man the view of human miseries should rather produce sorrow than comfort and add to his lamentations for his own misfortunes a deep compassion for those of others such is the imperfection even of the best of these philosophical topics of consolation shall conclude this subject with observing that though virtue be undoubtedly the best choice when it is attainable yet such is the disorder and confusion of human affairs that no perfect or regular distribution of happiness and misery is ever in this life to be expected not only the goods of fortune and the endowments of the body both of which are important not only these advantages say are unequally divided between the virtuous and vicious but even the mind itself partakes in some degree of this disorder and the most worthy character by the very constitution of the passions enjoys not always the highest felicity it is observable that though every bodily pain proceeds from some disorder in the part or organ yet the pain is not always proportioned to the disorder but is greater or less according to the greater or less sensibility of the part upon which the noxious humours exert their influence a toothach produces more violent convulsions of pain than a phthisis or a dropsy in like manner with regard to the œconomy of the mind we may observe that all vice is indeed pernicious yet the disturbance or pain is not measured out by nature with exact proportion to the degree of vice nor is the man of highest virtue even abstracting from external accidents always the most happy a gloomy and melancholy disposition is certainly to our sentiments a vice or imperfection but as it may be accompanied with great sense of honour and great integrity it may be found in very worthy characters though it is sufficient alone to imbitter life and render the person affected with it completely miserable on the other hand a selfish villain may possess a spring and alacrity of temper a certain gaiety of heartf which is indeed a good quality but which is rewarded much beyond its merit and when attended with good fortune will compensate for the uneasiness and remorse arising from all the other vices shall add as an observation to the same purpose that if a man be liable to a vice or imperfection it may often happen that a good quality which he possesses along with it will render him more miserable than if he were completely vicious a person of such imbecility of temper as to be easily broken by affliction is more unhappy for being endowed with a generous and friendly disposition which gives him a lively concern for others and exposes him the more to fortune and accidents a sense of shame in an imperfect character is certainly a virtue but produces great uneasiness and remorse from which the abandoned villain is entirely free a very amorous complexion with a heart incapable of friendship is happier than the same excess in love with a generosity of temper which transports a man beyond himself and renders him a total slave to the object of his passion in a word human life is more governed by fortune than by reason is to be regarded more as a dull pastime than as a serious occupation and is more influenced by particular humour than by general principles shall we engage ourselves in it with passion and anxiety it is not worthy of so much concern shall we be indifferent about what happens we lose all the pleasure of the game by our phlegm and carelessness while we are reasoning concerning life life is gone and death though perhaps they receive him differently yet treats alike the fool and the philosopher to reduce life to exact rule and method is commonly a painful oft a fruitless occupation and is it not also a proof that we overvalue the prize for which we contend even to reason so carefully concerning it and to fix with accuracy its just idea would be overvaluing it were it not that to some tempers this occupation is one of the most amusing in which life could possibly be employed essay of polygamy and divorces as marriage is an engagement entered into by mutual consent and has for its end the propagation of the species it is evident that it must be susceptible of all the variety of conditions which consent establishes provided they be not contrary to this end a man in conjoining himself to a woman is bound to her according to the terms of his engagement in begetting children he is bound by all the ties of nature and humanity to provide for their subsistence and education when he has performed these two parts of duty no one can reproach him with injustice or injury and as the terms of his engagement as well as the methods of subsisting his offspring may be various it is mere superstition to imagine that marriage can be entirely uniform and will admit only of one mode or form did not human laws restrain the natural liberty of men every particular marriage would be as different as contracts or bargains of any other kind or species as circumstances vary and the laws propose different advantages we find that in different times and places they impose different conditions on this important contract in tonquin it is usual for the sailors when the ships come into harbour to marry for the season and notwithstanding this precarious engagement they are assured it is said of the strictest fidelity to their bed as well as in the whole management of their affairs from those temporary spouses cannot at present recollect my authorities but have somewhere read that the republic of athens having lost many of its citizens by war and pestilence allowed every man to marry two wives in order the sooner to repair the waste which had been made by these calamities the poet euripides happened to be coupled to two noisy vixens who so plagued him with their jealousies and quarrels that he became ever after a professed woman hater and is the only theatrical writer perhaps the only poet that ever entertained an aversion to the sex in that agreeable romance called the history of thesevarambians where a great many men and a few women are supposed to be shipwrecked on a desert coast the captain of the troop in order to obviate those endless quarrels which arose regulates their marriages after the following manner he takes a handsome female to himself alone assigns one to every couple of inferior officers and to five of the lowest rank he gives one wife in commona the ancient britons had a singular kind of marriage to be met with among no other people any number of them as ten or a dozen joined in a society together which was perhaps requisite for mutual defence in those barbarous times in order to link this society the closer they took an equal number of wives in common and whatever children were born were reputed to belong to all of them and were accordingly provided for by the whole community among the inferior creatures nature herself being the supreme legislator prescribes all the laws which regulate their marriages and varies those laws according to the different circumstances of the creature where she furnishes with ease food and defence to the newborn animal the present embrace terminates the marriage and the care of the offspring is committed entirely to the female where the food is of more difficult purchase the marriage continues for one season till the common progeny can provide for itself and then the union immediately dissolves and leaves each of the parties free to enter into a new engagement at the ensuing season but nature having endowed man with reason has not so exactly regulated every article of his marriage contract but has left him to adjust them by his own prudence according to his particular circumstances and situation municipal laws are a supply to the wisdom of each individual and at the same time by restraining the natural liberty of men make private interest submit to the interest of the public all regulations therefore on this head are equally lawful and equally conformable to the principles of nature though they are not all equally convenient or equally useful to society the laws may allow of polygamy as among the eastern nations or of voluntary divorces as among the greeks and romans or they may confine one man to one woman during the whole course of their lives as among the modern europeans it may not be disagreeable to consider the advantages and disadvantages which result from each of these institutions the advocates for polygamy may recommend it as the only effectual remedy for the disorders of love and the only expedient for freeing men from that slavery to the females which the natural violence of our passions has imposed upon us by this means alone can we regain our right of sovereignty and sating our appetite reestablish the authority of reason in our minds and of consequence our own authority in our families man like a weak sovereign being unable to support himself against the wiles and intrigues of his subjects must play one faction against another and become absolute by the mutual jealousy of the females to divide and to govern is an universal maxim and by neglecting it the europeans undergo a more grievous and a more ignominious slavery than the turks or persians who are subjected indeed to a sovereign that lies at a distance from them but in their domestic affairs rule with an uncontroulable swayb on the other hand it may be urged with better reason that this sovereignty of the male is a real usurpation and destroys that nearness of rank not to say equality which nature has established between the sexes we are by nature their lovers their friends their patrons would we willingly exchange such endearing appellations for the barbarous title of master and tyrant in what capacity shall we gain by this inhuman proceeding as lovers or as husbands the lover is totally annihilated and courtship the most agreeable scene in life can no longer have place where women have not the free disposal of themselves but are bought and sold like the meanest animal the husband is as little a gainer having found the admirable secret of extinguishing every part of love except its jealousy no rose without its thorn but he must be a foolish wretch indeed that throws away the rose and preserves only the thornc but the asiatic manners are as destructive to friendship as to love jealousy excludes men from all intimacies and familiarities with each other no one dares bring his friend to his house or table lest he bring a lover to his numerous wives hence all over the east each family is as much separate from another as if they were so many distinct kingdoms no wonder then that solomon living like an eastern prince with his seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines without one friend could write so pathetically concerning the vanity of the world had he tried the secret of one wife or mistress a few friends and a great many companions he might have found life somewhat more agreeable destroy love and friendship what remains in the world worth accepting the bad education of children especially children of condition is another unavoidable consequence of these eastern institutions those who pass the early part of life among slaves are only qualified to be themselves slaves and tyrants and in every future intercourse either with their inferiors or superiors are apt to forget the natural equality of mankind what attention too can it be supposed a parent whose seraglio affords him fifty sons will give to instilling principles of morality or science into a progeny with whom he himself is scarcely acquainted and whom he loves with so divided an affection barbarism therefore appears from reason as well as experience to be the inseparable attendant of polygamyd to render polygamy more odious need not recount the frightful effects of jealousy and the constraint in which it holds the fairsex all over the east in those countries men are not allowed to have any commerce with the females not even physicians when sickness may be supposed to have extinguished all wanton passions in the bosoms of the fair and at the same time has rendered them unfit objects of desire tournefort tells us that when he was brought into the grand signiors seraglio as a physician he was not a little surprized in looking along a gallery to see a great number of naked arms standing out from the sides of the room he could not imagine what this could mean till he was told that those arms belonged to bodies which he must cure without knowing any more about them than what he could learn from the arms he was not allowed to ask a question of the patient or even of her attendants lest he might find it necessary to enquire concerning circumstances which the delicacy of the seraglio allows not to be revealed hence physicians in the east pretend to know all diseases from the pulse as our quacks in europe undertake to cure a person merely from seeing his water suppose had monsieurtournefort been of this latter kind he would not in constantinople have been allowed by the jealous turks to be furnished with materials requisite for exercising his art in another country where polygamy is also allowed they render their wives cripples and make their feet of no use to them in order to confine them to their own houses but it will perhaps appear strange that in a european country jealousy can yet be carried to such a height that it is indecent so much as to suppose that a woman of rank can have feet or legse witness the following story which we have from very good authority when the mother of the late king of spain was on her road towards madrid she passed through a little town in spain famous for its manufactory of gloves and stockings the magistrates of the place thought they could not better express their joy for the reception of their new queen than by presenting her with a sample of those commodities for which alone their town was remarkable the major domo who conducted the princess received the gloves very graciously but when the stockings were presented he flung them away with great indignation and severely reprimanded the magistrates for this egregious piece of indecency know says he that a queen ofspainhas no legs the young queen who at that time understood the language but imperfectly and had often been frightened with stories of spanish jealousy imagined that they were to cut off her legs upon which she fell a crying and begged them to conduct her back to germany for that she never could endure the operation and it was with some difficulty they could appease her philip is said never in his life to have laughed heartily but at the recital of this storyf having rejected polygamy and matched one man with one woman let us now consider what duration we shall assign to their union and whether we shall admit of those voluntary divorces which were customary among the greeks and romans those who would defend this practice may employ the following reasons how often does disgust and aversion arise after marriage from the most trivial accidents or from an incompatibility of humour where time instead of curing the wounds proceeding from mutual injuries festers them every day the more by new quarrels and reproaches let us separate hearts which were not made to associate together each of them may perhaps find another for which it is better fitted at least nothing can be more cruel than to preserve by violence an union which at first was made by mutual love and is now in effect dissolved by mutual hatred but the liberty of divorces is not only a cure to hatred and domestic quarrels it is also an admirable preservative against them and the only secret for keeping alive that love which first united the married couple the heart of man delights in liberty the very image of constraint is grievous to it when you would confine it by violence to what would otherwise have been its choice the inclination immediately changes and desire is turned into aversion if the public interest will not allow us to enjoy in polygamy that variety which is so agreeable in love at least deprive us not of that liberty which is so essentially requisite in vain you tell me that had my choice of the person with whom would conjoin myself had my choice it is true of my prison but this is but a small comfort since it must still be a prison such are the arguments which may be urged in favour of divorces but there seem to be these three unanswerable objections against them first what must become of the children upon the separation of the parents must they be committed to the care of a stepmother and instead of the fond attention and concern of a parent feel all the indifference or hatred of a stranger or an enemy these inconveniencies are sufficiently felt where nature has made the divorce by the doom inevitable to all mortals and shall we seek to multiply those inconveniencies by multiplying divorces and putting it in the power of parents upon every caprice to render their posterity miserable secondly if it be true on the one hand that the heart of man naturally delights in liberty and hates every thing to which it is confined it is also true on the other that the heart of man naturally submits to necessity and soon loses an inclination when there appears an absolute impossibility of gratifying it these principles of human nature youll say are contradictory but what is man but a heap of contradictions though it is remarkable that where principles are after this manner contrary in their operation they do not always destroy each other but the one or the other may predominate on any particular occasion according as circumstances are more or less favourable to it for instance love is a restless and impatient passion full of caprices and variations arising in a moment from a feature from an air from nothing and suddenly extinguishing after the same manner such a passion requires liberty above all things and therefore eloisa had reason when in order to preserve this passion she refused to marry her beloved abelard how oft when prest to marriage have said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies but friendship is a calm and sedate affection conducted by reason and cemented by habit springing from long acquaintance and mutual obligations without jealousies or fears and without those feverish fits of heat and cold which cause such an agreeable torment in the amorous passion so sober an affection therefore as friendship rather thrives under constraint and never rises to such a height as when any strong interest or necessity binds two persons together and gives them some common object of pursuitg we need not therefore be afraid of drawing the marriageknot which chiefly subsists by friendship the closest possible the amity between the persons where it is solid and sincere will rather gain by it and where it is wavering and uncertain this is the best expedient for fixing it how many frivolous quarrels and disgusts are there which people of common prudence endeavour to forget when they lie under a necessity of passing their lives together but which would soon be inflamed into the most deadly hatred were they pursued to the utmost under the prospect of an easy separation in the third place we must consider that nothing is more dangerous than to unite two persons so closely in all their interests and concerns as man and wife without rendering the union entire and total the least possibility of a separate interest must be the source of endless quarrels and suspicions the wife not secure of her establishment will still be driving some separate end or projecth and the husbands selfishness being accompanied with more power may be still more dangerous should these reasons against voluntary divorces be deemed insufficient hope no body will pretend to refuse the testimony of experience at the time when divorces were most frequent among the romans marriages were most rare and augustus was obliged by penal laws to force men of fashion into the married state a circumstance which is scarcely to be found in any other age or nationi the more ancient laws of rome which prohibited divorces are extremely praised by dionysius halycarnassæus wonderful was the harmony says the historian which this inseparable union of interests produced between married persons while each of them considered the inevitable necessity by which they were linked together and abandoned all prospect of any other choice or establishment the exclusion of polygamy and divorces sufficiently recommends our present european practice with regard to marriage essay of simplicity and refinement in writing fine writing according to mr addison consists of sentiments which are natural without being obvious there cannot be a juster and more concise definition of fine writing sentiments which are merely natural affect not the mind with any pleasure and seem not worthy of our attention the pleasantries of a waterman the observations of a peasant the ribaldry of a porter or hackney coachman all of these are natural and disagreeable what an insipid comedy should we make of the chitchat of the teatable copied faithfully and at full length nothing can please persons of taste but nature drawn with all her graces and ornaments la belle nature or if we copy low life the strokes must be strong and remarkable and must convey a lively image to the mind the absurd naivetya of sancho pancho is represented in such inimitable colours by cervantes that it entertains as much as the picture of the most magnanimous hero or softest lover the case is the same with orators philosophers critics or any author who speaks in his own person without introducing other speakers or actors if his language be not elegant his observations uncommon his sense strong and masculine he will in vain boast his nature and simplicity he may be correct but he never will be agreeable it is the unhappiness of such authors that they are never blamed or censured the good fortune of a book and that of a man are not the same the secret deceiving path of life which horace talks of fallentis semita vitæ may be the happiest lot of the one but is the greatest misfortune which the other can possibly fall into on the other hand productions which are merely surprising without being natural can never give any lasting entertainment to the mind to draw chimeras is not properly speaking to copy or imitate the justness of the representation is lost and the mind is displeased to find a picture which bears no resemblance to any original nor are such excessive refinements more agreeable in the epistolary or philosophic style than in the epic or tragic too much ornament is a fault in every kind of production uncommon expressions strong flashes of wit pointed similies and epigrammatic turns especially when they recur too frequently are a disfigurement rather than any embellishment of discourse as the eye in surveying a gothic building is distracted by the multiplicity of ornaments and loses the whole by its minute attention to the parts so the mind in perusing a work overstocked with wit is fatigued and disgusted with the constant endeavour to shine and surprize this is the case where a writer overabounds in wit even though that wit in itself should be just and agreeable but it commonly happens to such writers that they seek for their favourite ornaments even where the subject does not afford them and by that means have twenty insipid conceits for one thought which is really beautiful there is no subject in critical learning more copious than this of the just mixture of simplicity and refinement in writing and therefore not to wander in too large a field shall confine myself to a few general observations on that head first observe that though excesses of both kinds are to be avoided and though a proper medium ought to be studied in all productions yet this medium lies not in a point but admits of a considerable latitude consider the wide distance in this respect between mr pope and lucretius these seem to lie in the two greatest extremes of refinement and simplicity in which a poet can indulge himself without being guilty of any blameable excess all this interval may be filled with poets who may differ from each other but may be equally admirable each in his peculiar stile and manner corneille and congreve who carry their wit and refinement somewhat farther than mr pope if poets of so different a kind can be compared together and sophocles and terence who are more simple than lucretius seem to have gone out of that medium in which the most perfect productions are found and to be guilty of some excess in these opposite characters of all the great poets virgil and racine in my opinion lie nearest the center and are the farthest removed from both the extremities my second observation on this head is that it is very difficult if not impossible to explain by words where the just medium lies between the excesses of simplicity and refinement or to give any rule by which we can know precisely the bounds between the fault and the beauty a critic may not only discourse very judiciously on this head without instructing his readers but even without understanding the matter perfectly himself there is not a finer piece of criticism than the dissertation on pastorals by fontenelle in which by a number of reflections and philosophical reasonings he endeavours to fix the just medium which is suitable to that species of writing but let any one read the pastorals of that author and he will be convinced that this judicious critic notwithstanding his fine reasonings had a false taste and fixed the point of perfection much nearer the extreme of refinement than pastoral poetry will admit of the sentiments of his shepherds are better suited to the toilettes of paris than to the forests of arcadia but this it is impossible to discover from his critical reasonings he blames all excessive painting and ornament as much as virgil could have done had that great poet writ a dissertation on this species of poetry however different the tastes of men their general discourse on these subjects is commonly the same no criticism can be instructive which descends not to particulars and is not full of examples and illustrations it is allowed on all hands that beauty as well as virtue always lies in a medium but where this medium is placed is the great question and can never be sufficiently explained by general reasonings shall deliver it as a third observation on this subject that we ought to be more on our guard against the excess of refinement than that of simplicity and that because the former excess is both less beautiful and more dangerous than the latter it is a certain rule that wit and passion are entirely incompatible when the affections are moved there is no place for the imagination the mind of man being naturally limited it is impossible that all its faculties can operate at once and the more any one predominates the less room is there for the others to exert their vigour for this reason a greater degree of simplicity is required in all compositions where men and actions and passions are painted than in such as consist of reflections and observations and as the former species of writing is the more engaging and beautiful one may safely upon this account give the preference to the extreme of simplicity above that of refinement we may also observe that those compositions which we read the oftenest and which every man of taste has got by heart have the recommendation of simplicity and have nothing surprizing in the thought when divested of that elegance of expression and harmony of numbers with which it is cloathed if the merit of the composition lie in a point of wit it may strike at first but the mind anticipates the thought in the second perusal and is no longer affected by it when read an epigram of martial the first line recalls the whole and have no pleasure in repeating to myself what know already but each line each word in catullus has its merit and am never tired with the perusal of him it is sufficient to run over cowley once but parnel after the fiftieth reading is as fresh as at the first besides it is with books as with women where a certain plainness of manner and of dress is more engaging than that glare of paint and airs and apparel which may dazzle the eye but reaches not the affections terence is a modest and bashful beauty to whom we grant every thing because he assumes nothing and whose purity and nature make a durable though not a violent impression on us but refinement as it is the less beautiful so is it the more dangerous extreme and what we are the aptest to fall into simplicity passes for dulness when it is not accompanied with great elegance and propriety on the contrary there is something surprizing in a blaze of wit and conceit ordinary readers are mightily struck with it and falsely imagine it to be the most difficult as well as most excellent way of writing seneca abounds with agreeable faults says quintilian abundat dulcibus vitiis and for that reason is the more dangerous and the more apt to pervert the taste of the young and inconsiderate shall add that the excess of refinement is now more to be guarded against than ever because it is the extreme which men are the most apt to fall into after learning has made some progress and after eminent writers have appeared in every species of composition the endeavour to please by novelty leads men wide of simplicity and nature and fills their writings with affectation and conceit it was thus the asiatic eloquence degenerated so much from the atticb it was thus the age of claudius and nero became so much inferior to that of augustus in taste and genius and perhaps there are at present some symptoms of a like degeneracy of taste in france as well as in england essay of national characters thevulgar are apt to carry all national characters to extremes and having once established it as a principle that any people are knavish or cowardly or ignorant they will admit of no exception but comprehend every individual under the same censure men of sense condemn these undistinguishing judgments though at the same time they allow that each nation has a peculiar set of manners and that some particular qualities are more frequently to be met with among one people than among their neighbours the common people in switzerland have probably more honesty than those of the same rank in ireland and every prudent man will from that circumstance alone make a difference in the trust which he reposes in each we have reason to expect greater wit and gaiety in a frenchman than in a spaniard though cervantes was born in spain an englishman will naturally be supposed to have more knowledge than a dane though tycho brahe was a native of denmark different reasons are assigned for these national characters while some account for them from moral others from physical causes by moral causes mean all circumstances which are fitted to work on the mind as motives or reasons and which render a peculiar set of manners habitual to us of this kind are the nature of the government the revolutions of public affairs the plenty or penury in which the people live the situation of the nation with regard to its neighbours and such like circumstances by physical causes mean those qualities of the air and climate which are supposed to work insensibly on the temper by altering the tone and habit of the body and giving a particular complexion which though reflection and reason may sometimes overcome it will yet prevail among the generality of mankind and have an influence on their manners that the character of a nation will much depend on moral causes must be evident to the most superficial observer since a nation is nothing but a collection of individuals and the manners of individuals are frequently determined by these causes as poverty and hard labour debase the minds of the common people and render them unfit for any science and ingenious profession so where any government becomes very oppressive to all its subjects it must have a proportional effect on their temper and genius and must banish all the liberal arts from among thema the same principle of moral causes fixes the character of different professions and alters even that disposition which the particular members receive from the hand of nature a soldier and a priest are different characters in all nations and all ages and this difference is founded on circumstances whose operation is eternal and unalterable the uncertainty of their life makes soldiers lavish and generous as well as brave their idleness together with the large societies which they form in camps or garrisons inclines them to pleasure and gallantry by their frequent change of company they acquire good breeding and an openness of behaviour being employed only against a public and an open enemy they become candid honest and undesigning and as they use more the labour of the body than that of the mind they are commonly thoughtless and ignorant it is a trite but not altogether a false maxim that priests of all religions are the same and though the character of the profession will not in every instance prevail over the personal character yet is it sure always to predominate with the greater number for as chymists observe that spirits when raised to a certain height are all the same from whatever materials they be extracted so these men being elevated above humanity acquire a uniform character which is entirely their own and which in my opinion is generally speaking not the most amiable that is to be met with in human society it is in most points opposite to that of a soldier as is the way of life from which it is derived as to physical causes am inclined to doubt altogether of their operation in this particular nor do think that men owe any thing of their temper or genius to the air food or climate confess that the contrary opinion may justly at first sight seem probable since we find that these circumstances have an influence over every other animal and that even those creatures which are fitted to live in all climates such as dogs horses c do not attain the same perfection in all the courage of bulldogs and gamecocks seems peculiar to england flanders is remarkable for large and heavy horses spain for horses light and of good mettle and any breed of these creatures transplanted from one country to another will soon lose the qualities which they derived from their native climate it may be asked why not the same with men d there are few questions more curious than this or which will oftener occur in our enquiries concerning human affairs and therefore it may be proper to give it a full examination the human mind is of a very imitative nature nor is it possible for any set of men to converse often together without acquiring a similitude of manners and communicating to each other their vices as well as virtues the propensity to company and society is strong in all rational creatures and the same disposition which gives us this propensity makes us enter deeply into each others sentiments and causes like passions and inclinations to run as it were by contagion through the whole club or knot of companions where a number of men are united into one political body the occasions of their intercourse must be so frequent for defence commerce and government that together with the same speech or language they must acquire a resemblance in their manners and have a common or national character as well as a personal one peculiar to each individual now though nature produces all kinds of temper and understanding in great abundance it does not follow that she always produces them in like proportions and that in every society the ingredients of industry and indolence valour and cowardice humanity and brutality wisdom and folly will be mixed after the same manner in the infancy of society if any of these dispositions be found in greater abundance than the rest it will naturally prevail in the composition and give a tincture to the national character or should it be asserted that no species of temper can reasonably be presumed to predominate even in those contracted societies and that the same proportions will always be preserved in the mixture yet surely the persons in credit and authority being still a more contracted body cannot always be presumed to be of the same character and their influence on the manners of the people must at all times be very considerable if on the first establishment of a republic a brutus should be placed in authority and be transported with such an enthusiasm for liberty and public good as to overlook all the ties of nature as well as private interest such an illustrious example will naturally have an effect on the whole society and kindle the same passion in every bosom whatever it be that forms the manners of one generation the next must imbibe a deeper tincture of the same dye men being more susceptible of all impressions during infancy and retaining these impressions as long as they remain in the world assert then that all national characters where they depend not on fixed moral causes proceed from such accidents as these and that physical causes have no discernible operation on the human mind it is a maxim in all philosophy that causes which do not appear are to be considered as not existingf if we run over the globe or revolve the annals of history we shall discover every where signs of a sympathy or contagion of manners none of the influence of air or climate first we may observe that where a very extensive government has been established for many centuries it spreads a national character over the whole empire and communicates to every part a similarity of manners thus the chinese have the greatest uniformity of character imaginable though the air and climate in different parts of those vast dominions admit of very considerable variations secondly in small governments which are contiguous the people have notwithstanding a different character and are often as distinguishable in their manners as the most distant nations athens and thebes were but a short days journey from each other though the athenians were as remarkable for ingenuity politeness and gaiety as the thebans for dulness rusticity and a phlegmatic temper plutarch discoursing of the effects of air on the minds of men observes that the inhabitants of the piræum possessed very different tempers from those of the higher town in athens which was distant about four miles from the former but believe no one attributes the difference of manners in wapping and st jamess to a difference of air or climate thirdly the same national character commonly follows the authority of government to a precise boundary and upon crossing a river or passing a mountain one finds a new set of manners with a new government the languedocians and gascons are the gayest people in france but whenever you pass the pyrenees you are among spaniards is it conceivable that the qualities of the air should change exactly with the limits of an empire which depend so much on the accidents of battles negociations and marriages fourthly where any set of men scattered over distant nations maintain a close society or communication together they acquire a similitude of manners and have but little in common with the nations amongst whom they live thus the jews in europe and the armenians in the east have a peculiar character and the former are as much noted for fraud as the latter for probity the jesuits in all romancatholic countries are also observed to have a character peculiar to themselves fifthly where any accident as a difference in language or religion keeps two nations inhabiting the same country from mixing with each other they will preserve during several centuries a distinct and even opposite set of manners the integrity gravity and bravery of the turks form an exact contrast to the deceit levity and cowardice of the modern greeks sixthly the same set of manners will follow a nation and adhere to them over the whole globe as well as the same laws and language the spanish english french and dutch colonies are all distinguishable even between the tropics seventhly the manners of a people change very considerably from one age to another either by great alterations in their government by the mixtures of new people or by that inconstancy to which all human affairs are subject the ingenuity industry and activity of the ancient greeks have nothing in common with the stupidity and indolence of the present inhabitants of those regions candour bravery and love of liberty formed the character of the ancient romans as subtilty cowardice and a slavish disposition do that of the modern the old spaniards were restless turbulent and so addicted to war that many of them killed themselves when deprived of their arms by the romans one would find an equal difficulty at present at least one would have found it fifty years ago to rouze up the modern spaniards to arms the batavians were all soldiers of fortune and hired themselves into the roman armies their posterity make use of foreigners for the same purpose that the romans did their ancestors though some few strokes of the french character be the same with that which cæsar has ascribed to the gauls yet what comparison between the civility humanity and knowledge of the modern inhabitants of that country and the ignorance barbarity and grossness of the ancient not to insist upon the great difference between the present possessors of britain and those before the roman conquest we may observe that our ancestors a few centuries ago were sunk into the most abject superstition last century they were inflamed with the most furious enthusiasm and are now settled into the most cool indifference with regard to religious matters that is to be found in any nation of the worldh eighthly where several neighbouring nations have a very close communication together either by policy commerce or travelling they acquire a similitude of manners proportioned to the communication thus all the franks appear to have a uniform character to the eastern nations the differences among them are like the peculiar accents of different provinces which are not distinguishable except by an ear accustomed to them and which commonly escape a foreigner ninthly we may often remark a wonderful mixture of manners and characters in the same nation speaking the same language and subject to the same government and in this particular the english are the most remarkable of any people that perhaps ever were in the world nor is this to be ascribed to the mutability and uncertainty of their climate or to any other physical causes since all these causes take place in the neighbouring country of scotland without having the same effect where the government of a nation is altogether republican it is apt to beget a peculiar set of manners where it is altogether monarchical it is more apt to have the same effect the imitation of superiors spreading the national manners faster among the people if the governing part of a state consist altogether of merchants as in holland their uniform way of life will fix their character if it consists chiefly of nobles and landed gentry like germany france and spain the same effect follows the genius of a particular sect or religion is also apt to mould the manners of a people but the english government is a mixture of monarchy aristocracy and democracy the people in authority are composed of gentry and merchants all sects of religion are to be found among them and the great liberty and independency which every man enjoys allows him to display the manners peculiar to him hence the english of any people in the universe have the least of a national character unless this very singularity may pass for such if the characters of men depended on the air and climate the degrees of heat and cold should naturally be expected to have a mighty influence since nothing has a greater effect on all plants and irrational animals and indeed there is some reason to think that all the nations which live beyond the polar circles or between the tropics are inferior to the rest of the species and are incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind the poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe and the indolence of the southern from their few necessities may perhaps account for this remarkable difference without our having recourse to physical causes this however is certain that the characters of nations are very promiscuous in the temperate climates and that almost all the general observations which have been formed of the more southern or more northern people in these climates are found to be uncertain and fallacious shall we say that the neighbourhood of the sun inflames the imagination of men and gives it a peculiar spirit and vivacity the french greeks egyptians and persians are remarkable for gaiety the spaniards turks and chinese are noted for gravity and a serious deportment without any such difference of climate as to produce this difference of temper the greeks and romans who called all other nations barbarians confined genius and a fine understanding to the more southern climates and pronounced the northern nations incapable of all knowledge and civility but our island has produced as great men either for action or learning as greece or italy has to boast of it is pretended that the sentiments of men become more delicate as the country approaches nearer to the sun and that the taste of beauty and elegance receives proportional improvements in every latitude as we may particularly observe of the languages of which the more southern are smooth and melodious the northern harsh and untuneable but this observation holds not universally the arabic is uncouth and disagreeable the muscovite soft and musical energy strength and harshness form the character of the latin tongue the italian is the most liquid smooth and effeminate language that can possibly be imagined every language will depend somewhat on the manners of the people but much more on that original stock of words and sounds which they received from their ancestors and which remain unchangeable even while their manners admit of the greatest alterations who can doubt but the english are at present a more polite and knowing people than the greeks were for several ages after the siege of troy yet is there no comparison between the language of milton and that of homer nay the greater are the alterations and improvements which happen in the manners of a people the less can be expected in their language a few eminent and refined geniuses will communicate their taste and knowledge to a whole people and produce the greatest improvements but they fix the tongue by their writings and prevent in some degree its farther changes lord bacon has observed that the inhabitants of the south are in general more ingenious than those of the north but that where the native of a cold climate has genius he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits this observation a late writer confirms by comparing the southern wits to cucumbers which are commonly all good in their kind but at best are an insipid fruit while the northern geniuses are like melons of which not one in fifty is good but when it is so it has an exquisite relish believe this remark may be allowed just when confined to the european nations and to the present age or rather to the preceding one but think it may be accounted for from moral causes all the sciences and liberal arts have been imported to us from the south and it is easy to imagine that in the first ardor of application when excited by emulation and by glory the few who were addicted to them would carry them to the greatest height and stretch every nerve and every faculty to reach the pinnacle of perfection such illustrious examples spread knowledge every where and begot an universal esteem for the sciences after which it is no wonder that industry relaxes while men meet not with suitable encouragement nor arrive at such distinction by their attainments the universal diffusion of learning among a people and the entire banishment of gross ignorance and rusticity is therefore seldom attended with any remarkable perfection in particular persons it seems to be taken for granted in the dialogue de oratoribus that knowledge was much more common in vespasians age than in that of cicero and augustus quintilian also complains of the profanation of learning by its becoming too commonj formerly says juvenal science was confined to greece and italy now the whole world emulates athens and rome eloquent gaul has taught britain knowing in the laws even thule entertains thoughts of hiring rhetoricians for its instruction this state of learning is remarkable because juvenal is himself the last of the roman writers that possessed any degree of genius those who succeeded are valued for nothing but the matters of fact of which they give us information hope the late conversion of muscovy to the study of the sciences will not prove a like prognostic to the present period of learning cardinal bentivoglio gives the preference to the northern nations above the southern with regard to candour and sincerity and mentions on the one hand the spaniards and italians and on the other the flemings and germans but am apt to think that this has happened by accident the ancient romans seem to have been a candid sincere people as are the modern turks but if we must needs suppose that this event has arisen from fixed causes we may only conclude from it that all extremes are apt to concur and are commonly attended with the same consequences treachery is the usual concomitant of ignorance and barbarism and if civilized nations ever embrace subtle and crooked politics it is from an excess of refinement which makes them disdain the plain direct path to power and glory most conquests have gone from north to south and it has hence been inferred that the northern nations possess a superior degree of courage and ferocity but it would have been juster to have said that most conquests are made by poverty and want upon plenty and riches the saracens leaving the deserts of arabia carried their conquests northwards upon all the fertile provinces of the roman empire and met the turks half way who were coming southwards from the deserts of tartary an eminent writer has remarked that all courageous animals are also carnivorous and that greater courage is to be expected in a people such as the english whose food is strong and hearty than in the halfstarved commonalty of other countries but the swedes notwithstanding their disadvantages in this particular are not inferior in martial courage to any nation that ever was in the world in general we may observe that courage of all national qualities is the most precarious because it is exerted only at intervals and by a few in every nation whereas industry knowledge civility may be of constant and universal use and for several ages may become habitual to the whole people if courage be preserved it must be by discipline example and opinion the tenth legion of cæsar and the regiment of picardy in france were formed promiscuously from among the citizens but having once entertained a notion that they were the best troops in the service this very opinion really made them such as a proof how much courage depends on opinion we may observe that of the two chief tribes of the greeks the dorians and ionians the former were always esteemed and always appeared more brave and manly than the latter though the colonies of both the tribes were interspersed and intermingled throughout all the extent of greece the lesser asia sicily italy and the islands of the ægean sea the athenians were the only ionians that ever had any reputation for valour or military atchievements though even these were deemed inferior to the lacedemonians the bravest of the dorians the only observation with regard to the difference of men in different climates on which we can rest any weight is the vulgar one that people in the northern regions have a greater inclination to strong liquors and those in the southern to love and women one can assign a very probable physical cause for this difference wine and distilled waters warm the frozen blood in the colder climates and fortify men against the injuries of the weather as the genial heat of the sun in the countries exposed to his beams inflames the blood and exalts the passion between the sexes perhaps too the matter may be accounted for by moral causes all strong liquors are rarer in the north and consequently are more coveted diodorus siculus tells us that the gauls in his time were great drunkards and much addicted to wine chiefly suppose from its rarity and novelty on the other hand the heat in the southern climates obliging men and women to go half naked thereby renders their frequent commerce more dangerous and inflames their mutual passion this makes parents and husbands more jealous and reserved which still farther inflames the passion not to mention that as women ripen sooner in the southern regions it is necessary to observe greater jealousy and care in their education it being evident that a girl of twelve cannot possess equal discretion to govern this passion with one who feels not its violence till she be seventeen or eighteen nothing so much encourages the passion of love as ease and leisure or is more destructive to it than industry and hard labour and as the necessities of men are evidently fewer in the warm climates than in the cold ones this circumstance alone may make a considerable difference between theml but perhaps the fact is doubtful that nature has either from moral or physical causes distributed these respective inclinations to the different climates the ancient greeks though born in a warm climate seem to have been much addicted to the bottle nor were their parties of pleasure any thing but matches of drinking among men who passed their time altogether apart from the fair yet when alexander led the greeks into persia a still more southern climate they multiplied their debauches of this kind in imitation of the persian manners so honourable was the character of a drunkard among the persians that cyrus the younger soliciting the sober lacedemonians for succour against his brother artaxerxes claims it chiefly on account of his superior endowments as more valorous more bountiful and a better drinkerdarius hystaspes made it be inscribed on his tombstone among his other virtues and princely qualities that no one could bear a greater quantity of liquor you may obtain any thing of the negroes by offering them strong drink and may easily prevail with them to sell not only their children but their wives and mistresses for a cask of brandy in france and italy few drink pure wine except in the greatest heats of summer and indeed it is then almost as necessary in order to recruit the spirits evaporated by heat as it is in sweden during the winter in order to warm the bodies congealed by the rigour of the season if jealousy be regarded as a proof of an amorous disposition no people were more jealous than the muscovites before their communication with europe had somewhat altered their manners in this particular but supposing the fact true that nature by physical principles has regularly distributed these two passions the one to the northern the other to the southern regions we can only infer that the climate may affect the grosser and more bodily organs of our frame not that it can work upon those finer organs on which the operations of the mind and understanding depend and this is agreeable to the analogy of nature the races of animals never degenerate when carefully tended and horses in particular always show their blood in their shape spirit and swiftness but a coxcomb may beget a philosopher as a man of virtue may leave a worthless progeny shall conclude this subject with observing that though the passion for liquor be more brutal and debasing than love which when properly managed is the source of all politeness and refinement yet this gives not so great an advantage to the southern climates as we may be apt at first sight to imagine when love goes beyond a certain pitch it renders men jealous and cuts off the free intercourse between the sexes on which the politeness of a nation will commonly much depend and if we would subtilize and refine upon this point we might observe that the people in very temperate climates are the most likely to attain all sorts of improvement their blood not being so inflamed as to render them jealous and yet being warm enough to make them set a due value on the charms and endowments of the fair sex essay of tragedy it seems an unaccountable pleasure which the spectators of a wellwritten tragedy receive from sorrow terror anxiety and other passions that are in themselves disagreeable and uneasy the more they are touched and affected the more are they delighted with the spectacle and as soon as the uneasy passions cease to operate the piece is at an end one scene of full joy and contentment and security is the utmost that any composition of this kind can bear and it is sure always to be the concluding one if in the texture of the piece there be interwoven any scenes of satisfaction they afford only faint gleams of pleasure which are thrown in by way of variety and in order to plunge the actors into deeper distress by means of that contrast and disappointment the whole art of the poet is employed in rouzing and supporting the compassion and indignation the anxiety and resentment of his audience they are pleased in proportion as they are afflicted and never are so happy as when they employ tears sobs and cries to give vent to their sorrow and relieve their heart swoln with the tenderest sympathy and compassion the few critics who have had some tincture of philosophy have remarked this singular phænomenon and have endeavoured to account for it labbe dubos in his reflections on poetry and painting asserts that nothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the languid listless state of indolence into which it falls upon the removal of all passion and occupation to get rid of this painful situation it seeks every amusement and pursuit business gaming shews executions whatever will rouze the passions and take its attention from itself no matter what the passion is let it be disagreeable afflicting melancholy disordered it is still better than that insipid languor which arises from perfect tranquillity and repose it is impossible not to admit this account as being at least in part satisfactory you may observe when there are several tables of gaming that all the company run to those where the deepest play is even though they find not there the best players the view or at least imagination of high passions arising from great loss or gain affects the spectator by sympathy gives him some touches of the same passions and serves him for a momentary entertainment it makes the time pass the easier with him and is some relief to that oppression under which men commonly labour when left entirely to their own thoughts and meditations we find that common liars always magnify in their narrations all kinds of danger pain distress sickness deaths murders and cruelties as well as joy beauty mirth and magnificence it is an absurd secret which they have for pleasing their company fixing their attention and attaching them to such marvellous relations by the passions and emotions which they excite there is however a difficulty in applying to the present subject in its full extent this solution however ingenious and satisfactory it may appear it is certain that the same object of distress which pleases in a tragedy were it really set before us would give the most unfeigned uneasiness though it be then the most effectual cure to languor and indolence monsieur fontenelle seems to have been sensible of this difficulty and accordingly attempts another solution of the phænomenon at least makes some addition to the theory above mentioned pleasure and pain says he which are two sentiments so different in themselves differ not so much in their cause from the instance of tickling it appears that the movement of pleasure pushed a little too far becomes pain and that the movement of pain a little moderated becomes pleasure hence it proceeds that there is such a thing as a sorrow soft and agreeable it is a pain weakened and diminished the heart likes naturally to be moved and affected melancholy objects suit it and even disastrous and sorrowful provided they are softened by some circumstance it is certain that on the theatre the representation has almost the effect of reality yet it has not altogether that effect however we may be hurried away by the spectacle whatever dominion the senses and imagination may usurp over the reason there still lurks at the bottom a certain idea of falsehood in the whole of what we see this idea though weak and disguised suffices to diminish the pain which we suffer from the misfortunes of those whom we love and to reduce that affliction to such a pitch as converts it into a pleasure we weep for the misfortune of a hero to whom we are attached in the same instant we comfort ourselves by reflecting that it is nothing but a fiction and it is precisely that mixture of sentiments which composes an agreeable sorrow and tears that delight us but as that affliction which is caused by exterior and sensible objects is stronger than the consolation which arises from an internal reflection they are the effects and symptoms of sorrow that ought to predominate in the composition this solution seems just and convincing but perhaps it wants still some new addition in order to make it answer fully the phænomenon which we here examine all the passions excited by eloquence are agreeable in the highest degree as well as those which are moved by painting and the theatre the epilogues of cicero are on this account chiefly the delight of every reader of taste and it is difficult to read some of them without the deepest sympathy and sorrow his merit as an orator no doubt depends much on his success in this particular when he had raised tears in his judges and all his audience they were then the most highly delighted and expressed the greatest satisfaction with the pleader the pathetic description of the butchery made by verres of the sicilian captains is a masterpiece of this kind but believe none will affirm that the being present at a melancholy scene of that nature would afford any entertainment neither is the sorrow here softened by fiction for the audience were convinced of the reality of every circumstance what is it then which in this case raises a pleasure from the bosom of uneasiness so to speak and a pleasure which still retains all the features and outward symptoms of distress and sorrow answer this extraordinary effect proceeds from that very eloquence with which the melancholy scene is represented the genius required to paint objects in a lively manner the art employed in collecting all the pathetic circumstances the judgment displayed in disposing them the exercise say of these noble talents together with the force of expression and beauty of oratorial numbers diffuse the highest satisfaction on the audience and excite the most delightful movements by this means the uneasiness of the melancholy passions is not only overpowered and effaced by something stronger of an opposite kind but the whole impulse of those passions is converted into pleasure and swells the delight which the eloquence raises in us the same force of oratory employed on an uninteresting subject would not please half so much or rather would appear altogether ridiculous and the mind being left in absolute calmness and indifference would relish none of those beauties of imagination or expression which if joined to passion give it such exquisite entertainment the impulse or vehemence arising from sorrow compassion indignation receives a new direction from the sentiments of beauty the latter being the predominant emotion seize the whole mind and convert the former into themselves at least tincture them so strongly as totally to alter their nature and the soul being at the same time rouzed by passion and charmed by eloquence feels on the whole a strong movement which is altogether delightful the same principle takes place in tragedy with this addition that tragedy is an imitation and imitation is always of itself agreeable this circumstance serves still farther to smooth the motions of passion and convert the whole feeling into one uniform and strong enjoyment objects of the greatest terror and distress please in painting and please more than the most beautiful objects that appear calm and indifferent the affection rouzing the mind excites a large stock of spirit and vehemence which is all transformed into pleasure by the force of the prevailing movement it is thus the fiction of tragedy softens the passion by an infusion of a new feeling not merely by weakening or diminishing the sorrow you may by degrees weaken a real sorrow till it totally disappears yet in none of its gradations will it ever give pleasure except perhaps by accident to a man sunk under lethargic indolence whom it rouzes from that languid state to confirm this theory it will be sufficient to produce other instances where the subordinate movement is converted into the predominant and gives force to it though of a different and even sometimes though of a contrary nature novelty naturally rouzes the mind and attracts our attention and the movements which it causes are always converted into any passion belonging to the object and join their force to it whether an event excite joy or sorrow pride or shame anger or goodwill it is sure to produce a stronger affection when new or unusual and though novelty of itself be agreeable it fortifies the painful as well as agreeable passions had you any intention to move a person extremely by the narration of any event the best method of encreasing its effect would be artfully to delay informing him of it and first to excite his curiosity and impatience before you let him into the secret this is the artifice practised by iago in the famous scene of shakespeare and every spectator is sensible that othellos jealousy acquires additional force from his preceding impatience and that the subordinate passion is here readily transformed into the predominant one difficulties encrease passions of every kind and by rouzing our attention and exciting our active powers they produce an emotion which nourishes the prevailing affection parents commonly love that child most whose sickly infirm frame of body has occasioned them the greatest pains trouble and anxiety in rearing him the agreeable sentiment of affection here acquires force from sentiments of uneasiness nothing endears so much a friend as sorrow for his death the pleasure of his company has not so powerful an influence jealousy is a painful passion yet without some share of it the agreeable affection of love has difficulty to subsist in its full force and violence absence is also a great source of complaint among lovers and gives them the greatest uneasiness yet nothing is more favourable to their mutual passion than short intervals of that kind and if long intervals often prove fatal it is only because through time men are accustomed to them and they cease to give uneasiness jealousy and absence in love compose the dolce peccante of the italians which they suppose so essential to all pleasure there is a fine observation of the elder pliny which illustrates the principle here insisted on it is very remarkable says he that the last works of celebrated artists which they left imperfect are always the most prized such as theirisofaristides thetyndaridesofnicomachus themedeaoftimomachus and thevenusofapelles these are valued even above their finished productions the broken lineaments of the piece and the halfformed idea of the painter are carefully studied and our very grief for that curious hand which had been stopped by death is an additional encrease to our pleasure these instances and many more might be collected are sufficient to afford us some insight into the analogy of nature and to show us that the pleasure which poets orators and musicians give us by exciting grief sorrow indignation compassion is not so extraordinary or paradoxical as it may at first sight appear the force of imagination the energy of expression the power of numbers the charms of imitation all these are naturally of themselves delightful to the mind and when the object presented lays also hold of some affection the pleasure still rises upon us by the conversion of this subordinate movement into that which is predominant the passion though perhaps naturally and when excited by the simple appearance of a real object it may be painful yet is so smoothed and softened and mollified when raised by the finer arts that it affords the highest entertainment to confirm this reasoning we may observe that if the movements of the imagination be not predominant above those of the passion a contrary effect follows and the former being now subordinate is converted into the latter and still farther encreases the pain and affliction of the sufferer who could ever think of it as a good expedient for comforting an afflicted parent to exaggerate with all the force of elocution the irreparable loss which he has met with by the death of a favourite child the more power of imagination and expression you here employ the more you encrease his despair and affliction the shame confusion and terror of verres no doubt rose in proportion to the noble eloquence and vehemence of cicero so also did his pain and uneasiness these former passions were too strong for the pleasure arising from the beauties of elocution and operated though from the same principle yet in a contrary manner to the sympathy compassion and indignation of the audience lord clarendon when he approaches towards the catastrophe of the royal party supposes that his narration must then become infinitely disagreeable and he hurries over the kings death without giving us one circumstance of it he considers it as too horrid a scene to be contemplated with any satisfaction or even without the utmost pain and aversion he himself as well as the readers of that age were too deeply concerned in the events and felt a pain from subjects which an historian and a reader of another age would regard as the most pathetic and most interesting and by consequence the most agreeable an action represented in tragedy may be too bloody and atrocious it may excite such movements of horror as will not soften into pleasure and the greatest energy of expression bestowed on descriptions of that nature serves only to augment our uneasiness such is that action represented in the ambitious stepmother where a venerable old man raised to the height of fury and despair rushes against a pillar and striking his head upon it besmears it all over with mingled brains and gore the english theatre abounds too much with such shocking images even the common sentiments of compassion require to be softened by some agreeable affection in order to give a thorough satisfaction to the audience the mere suffering of plaintive virtue under the triumphant tyranny and oppression of vice forms a disagreeable spectacle and is carefully avoided by all masters of the drama in order to dismiss the audience with entire satisfaction and contentment the virtue must either convert itself into a noble courageous despair or the vice receive its proper punishment most painters appear in this light to have been very unhappy in their subjects as they wrought much for churches and convents they have chiefly represented such horrible subjects as crucifixions and martyrdoms where nothing appears but tortures wounds executions and passive suffering without any action or affection when they turned their pencil from this ghastly mythology they had commonly recourse to ovid whose fictions though passionate and agreeable are scarcely natural or probable enough for painting the same inversion of that principle which is here insisted on displays itself in common life as in the effects of oratory and poetry raise so the subordinate passion that it becomes the predominant it swallows up that affection which it before nourished and encreased too much jealousy extinguishes love too much difficulty renders us indifferent too much sickness and infirmity disgusts a selfish and unkind parent what so disagreeable as the dismal gloomy disastrous stories with which melancholy people entertain their companions the uneasy passion being there raised alone unaccompanied with any spirit genius or eloquence conveys a pure uneasiness and is attended with nothing that can soften it into pleasure or satisfaction essay of the standard of taste the great variety of taste as well as of opinion which prevails in the world is too obvious not to have fallen under every ones observation men of the most confined knowledge are able to remark a difference of taste in the narrow circle of their acquaintance even where the persons have been educated under the same government and have early imbibed the same prejudices but those who can enlarge their view to contemplate distant nations and remote ages are still more surprized at the great inconsistence and contrariety we are apt to call barbarous whatever departs widely from our own taste and apprehension but soon find the epithet of reproach retorted on us and the highest arrogance and selfconceit is at last startled on observing an equal assurance on all sides and scruples amidst such a contest of sentiment to pronounce positively in its own favour as this variety of taste is obvious to the most careless enquirer so will it be found on examination to be still greater in reality than in appearance the sentiments of men often differ with regard to beauty and deformity of all kinds even while their general discourse is the same there are certain terms in every language which import blame and others praise and all men who use the same tongue must agree in their application of them every voice is united in applauding elegance propriety simplicity spirit in writing and in blaming fustian affectation coldness and a false brilliancy but when critics come to particulars this seeming unanimity vanishes and it is found that they had affixed a very different meaning to their expressions in all matters of opinion and science the case is opposite the difference among men is there oftener found to lie in generals than in particulars and to be less in reality than in appearance an explanation of the terms commonly ends the controversy and the disputants are surprized to find that they had been quarrelling while at bottom they agreed in their judgment those who found morality on sentiment more than on reason are inclined to comprehend ethics under the former observation and to maintain that in all questions which regard conduct and manners the difference among men is really greater than at first sight it appears it is indeed obvious that writers of all nations and all ages concur in applauding justice humanity magnanimity prudence veracity and in blaming the opposite qualities even poets and other authors whose compositions are chiefly calculated to please the imagination are yet found from homer down to fenelon to inculcate the same moral precepts and to bestow their applause and blame on the same virtues and vices this great unanimity is usually ascribed to the influence of plain reason which in all these cases maintains similar sentiments in all men and prevents those controversies to which the abstract sciences are so much exposed so far as the unanimity is real this account may be admitted as satisfactory but we must also allow that some part of the seeming harmony in morals may be accounted for from the very nature of language the word virtue with its equivalent in every tongue implies praise as that of vice does blame and no one without the most obvious and grossest impropriety could affix reproach to a term which in general acceptation is understood in a good sense or bestow applause where the idiom requires disapprobation homers general precepts where he delivers any such will never be controverted but it is obvious that when he draws particular pictures of manners and represents heroism in achilles and prudence in ulysses he intermixes a much greater degree of ferocity in the former and of cunning and fraud in the latter than fenelon would admit of the sage ulysses in the greek poet seems to delight in lies and fictions and often employs them without any necessity or even advantage but his more scrupulous son in the french epic writer exposes himself to the most imminent perils rather than depart from the most exact line of truth and veracity the admirers and followers of the alcoran insist on the excellent moral precepts interspersed throughout that wild and absurd performance but it is to be supposed that the arabic words which correspond to the english equity justice temperance meekness charity were such as from the constant use of that tongue must always be taken in a good sense and it would have argued the greatest ignorance not of morals but of language to have mentioned them with any epithets besides those of applause and approbation but would we know whether the pretended prophet had really attained a just sentiment of morals let us attend to his narration and we shall soon find that he bestows praise on such instances of treachery inhumanity cruelty revenge bigotry as are utterly incompatible with civilized society no steady rule of right seems there to be attended to and every action is blamed or praised so far only as it is beneficial or hurtful to the true believers the merit of delivering true general precepts in ethics is indeed very small whoever recommends any moral virtues really does no more than is implied in the terms themselves that people who invented the word charity and used it in a good sense inculcated more clearly and much more efficaciously the precept be charitable than any pretended legislator or prophet who should insert such a maxim in his writings of all expressions those which together with their other meaning imply a degree either of blame or approbation are the least liable to be perverted or mistaken it is natural for us to seek a standard of taste a rule by which the various sentiments of men may be reconciled at least a decision afforded confirming one sentiment and condemning another there is a species of philosophy which cuts off all hopes of success in such an attempt and represents the impossibility of ever attaining any standard of taste the difference it is said is very wide between judgment and sentiment all sentiment is right because sentiment has a reference to nothing beyond itself and is always real wherever a man is conscious of it but all determinations of the understanding are not right because they have a reference to something beyond themselves to wit real matter of fact and are not always conformable to that standard among a thousand different opinions which different men may entertain of the same subject there is one and but one that is just and true and the only difficulty is to fix and ascertain it on the contrary a thousand different sentiments excited by the same object are all right because no sentiment represents what is really in the object it only marks a certain conformity or relation between the object and the organs or faculties of the mind and if that conformity did not really exist the sentiment could never possibly have being beauty is no quality in things themselves it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them and each mind perceives a different beauty one person may even perceive deformity where another is sensible of beauty and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment without pretending to regulate those of others to seek the real beauty or real deformity is as fruitless an enquiry as to pretend to ascertain the real sweet or real bitter according to the disposition of the organs the same object may be both sweet and bitter and the proverb has justly determined it to be fruitless to dispute concerning tastes it is very natural and even quite necessary to extend this axiom to mental as well as bodily taste and thus common sense which is so often at variance with philosophy especially with the sceptical kind is found in one instance at least to agree in pronouncing the same decision but though this axiom by passing into a proverb seems to have attained the sanction of common sense there is certainly a species of common sense which opposes it at least serves to modify and restrain it whoever would assert an equality of genius and elegance between ogilby and milton or bunyan and addison would be thought to defend no less an extravagance than if he had maintained a molehill to be as high as teneriffe or a pond as extensive as the ocean though there may be found persons who give the preference to the former authors no one pays attention to such a taste and we pronounce without scruple the sentiment of these pretended critics to be absurd and ridiculous the principle of the natural equality of tastes is then totally forgot and while we admit it on some occasions where the objects seem near an equality it appears an extravagant paradox or rather a palpable absurdity where objects so disproportioned are compared together it is evident that none of the rules of composition are fixed by reasonings a priori or can be esteemed abstract conclusions of the understanding from comparing those habitudes and relations of ideas which are eternal and immutable their foundation is the same with that of all the practical sciences experience nor are they any thing but general observations concerning what has been universally found to please in all countries and in all ages many of the beauties of poetry and even of eloquence are founded on falsehood and fiction on hyperboles metaphors and an abuse or perversion of terms from their natural meaning to check the sallies of the imagination and to reduce every expression to geometrical truth and exactness would be the most contrary to the laws of criticism because it would produce a work which by universal experience has been found the most insipid and disagreeable but though poetry can never submit to exact truth it must be confined by rules of art discovered to the author either by genius or observation if some negligent or irregular writers have pleased they have not pleased by their transgressions of rule or order but in spite of these transgressions they have possessed other beauties which were conformable to just criticism and the force of these beauties has been able to overpower censure and give the mind a satisfaction superior to the disgust arising from the blemishes ariosto pleases but not by his monstrous and improbable fictions by his bizarre mixture of the serious and comic styles by the want of coherence in his stories or by the continual interruptions of his narration he charms by the force and clearness of his expression by the readiness and variety of his inventions and by his natural pictures of the passions especially those of the gay and amorous kind and however his faults may diminish our satisfaction they are not able entirely to destroy it did our pleasure really arise from those parts of his poem which we denominate faults this would be no objection to criticism in general it would only be an objection to those particular rules of criticism which would establish such circumstances to be faults and would represent them as universally blameable if they are found to please they cannot be faults let the pleasure which they produce be ever so unexpected and unaccountable but though all the general rules of art are founded only on experience and on the observation of the common sentiments of human nature we must not imagine that on every occasion the feelings of men will be conformable to these rules those finer emotions of the mind are of a very tender and delicate nature and require the concurrence of many favourable circumstances to make them play with facility and exactness according to their general and established principles the least exterior hindrance to such small springs or the least internal disorder disturbs their motion and confounds the operation of the whole machine when we would make an experiment of this nature and would try the force of any beauty or deformity we must choose with care a proper time and place and bring the fancy to a suitable situation and disposition a perfect serenity of mind a recollection of thought a due attention to the object if any of these circumstances be wanting our experiment will be fallacious and we shall be unable to judge of the catholic and universal beauty the relation which nature has placed between the form and the sentiment will at least be more obscure and it will require greater accuracy to trace and discern it we shall be able to ascertain its influence not so much from the operation of each particular beauty as from the durable admiration which attends those works that have survived all the caprices of mode and fashion all the mistakes of ignorance and envy the same homer who pleased at athens and rome two thousand years ago is still admired at paris and at london all the changes of climate government religion and language have not been able to obscure his glory authority or prejudice may give a temporary vogue to a bad poet or orator but his reputation will never be durable or general when his compositions are examined by posterity or by foreigners the enchantment is dissipated and his faults appear in their true colours on the contrary a real genius the longer his works endure and the more wide they are spread the more sincere is the admiration which he meets with envy and jealousy have too much place in a narrow circle and even familiar acquaintance with his person may diminish the applause due to his performances but when these obstructions are removed the beauties which are naturally fitted to excite agreeable sentiments immediately display their energy and while the world endures they maintain their authority over the minds of men it appears then that amidst all the variety and caprice of taste there are certain general principles of approbation or blame whose influence a careful eye may trace in all operations of the mind some particular forms or qualities from the original structure of the internal fabric are calculated to please and others to displease and if they fail of their effect in any particular instance it is from some apparent defect or imperfection in the organ a man in a fever would not insist on his palate as able to decide concerning flavours nor would one affected with the jaundice pretend to give a verdict with regard to colours in each creature there is a sound and a defective state and the former alone can be supposed to afford us a true standard of taste and sentiment if in the sound state of the organ there be an entire or a considerable uniformity of sentiment among men we may thence derive an idea of the perfect beauty in like manner as the appearance of objects in daylight to the eye of a man in health is denominated their true and real colour even while colour is allowed to be merely a phantasm of the senses many and frequent are the defects in the internal organs which prevent or weaken the influence of those general principles on which depends our sentiment of beauty or deformity though some objects by the structure of the mind be naturally calculated to give pleasure it is not to be expected that in every individual the pleasure will be equally felt particular incidents and situations occur which either throw a false light on the objects or hinder the true from conveying to the imagination the proper sentiment and perception one obvious cause why many feel not the proper sentiment of beauty is the want of that delicacy of imagination which is requisite to convey a sensibility of those finer emotions this delicacy every one pretends to every one talks of it and would reduce every kind of taste or sentiment to its standard but as our intention in this essay is to mingle some light of the understanding with the feelings of sentiment it will be proper to give a more accurate definition of delicacy than has hitherto been attempted and not to draw our philosophy from too profound a source we shall have recourse to a noted story in don quixote it is with good reason says sancho to the squire with the great nose that pretend to have a judgment in wine this is a quality hereditary in our family two of my kinsmen were once called to give their opinion of a hogshead which was supposed to be excellent being old and of a good vintage one of them tastes it considers it and after mature reflection pronounces the wine to be good were it not for a small taste of leather which he perceived in it the other after using the same precautions gives also his verdict in favour of the wine but with the reserve of a taste of iron which he could easily distinguish you cannot imagine how much they were both ridiculed for their judgment but who laughed in the end on emptying the hogshead there was found at the bottom an old key with a leathern thong tied to it the great resemblance between mental and bodily taste will easily teach us to apply this story though it be certain that beauty and deformity more than sweet and bitter are not qualities in objects but belong entirely to the sentiment internal or external it must be allowed that there are certain qualities in objects which are fitted by nature to produce those particular feelings now as these qualities may be found in a small degree or may be mixed and confounded with each other it often happens that the taste is not affected with such minute qualities or is not able to distinguish all the particular flavours amidst the disorder in which they are presented where the organs are so fine as to allow nothing to escape them and at the same time so exact as to perceive every ingredient in the composition this we call delicacy of taste whether we employ these terms in the literal or metaphorical sense here then the general rules of beauty are of use being drawn from established models and from the observation of what pleases or displeases when presented singly and in a high degree and if the same qualities in a continued composition and in a smaller degree affect not the organs with a sensible delight or uneasiness we exclude the person from all pretensions to this delicacy to produce these general rules or avowed patterns of composition is like finding the key with the leathern thong which justified the verdict of sanchos kinsmen and confounded those pretended judges who had condemned them though the hogshead had never been emptied the taste of the one was still equally delicate and that of the other equally dull and languid but it would have been more difficult to have proved the superiority of the former to the conviction of every bystander in like manner though the beauties of writing had never been methodized or reduced to general principles though no excellent models had ever been acknowledged the different degrees of taste would still have subsisted and the judgment of one man been preferable to that of another but it would not have been so easy to silence the bad critic who might always insist upon his particular sentiment and refuse to submit to his antagonist but when we show him an avowed principle of art when we illustrate this principle by examples whose operation from his own particular taste he acknowledges to be conformable to the principle when we prove that the same principle may be applied to the present case where he did not perceive or feel its influence he must conclude upon the whole that the fault lies in himself and that he wants the delicacy which is requisite to make him sensible of every beauty and every blemish in any composition or discourse it is acknowledged to be the perfection of every sense or faculty to perceive with exactness its most minute objects and allow nothing to escape its notice and observation the smaller the objects are which become sensible to the eye the finer is that organ and the more elaborate its make and composition a good palate is not tried by strong flavours but by a mixture of small ingredients where we are still sensible of each part notwithstanding its minuteness and its confusion with the rest in like manner a quick and acute perception of beauty and deformity must be the perfection of our mental taste nor can a man be satisfied with himself while he suspects that any excellence or blemish in a discourse has passed him unobserved in this case the perfection of the man and the perfection of the sense or feeling are found to be united a very delicate palate on many occasions may be a great inconvenience both to a man himself and to his friends but a delicate taste of wit or beauty must always be a desirable quality because it is the source of all the finest and most innocent enjoyments of which human nature is susceptible in this decision the sentiments of all mankind are agreed wherever you can ascertain a delicacy of taste it is sure to meet with approbation and the best way of ascertaining it is to appeal to those models and principles which have been established by the uniform consent and experience of nations and ages but though there be naturally a wide difference in point of delicacy between one person and another nothing tends further to encrease and improve this talent than practice in a particular art and the frequent survey or contemplation of a particular species of beauty when objects of any kind are first presented to the eye or imagination the sentiment which attends them is obscure and confused and the mind is in a great measure incapable of pronouncing concerning their merits or defects the taste cannot perceive the several excellencies of the performance much less distinguish the particular character of each excellency and ascertain its quality and degree if it pronounce the whole in general to be beautiful or deformed it is the utmost that can be expected and even this judgment a person so unpractised will be apt to deliver with great hesitation and reserve but allow him to acquire experience in those objects his feeling becomes more exact and nice he not only perceives the beauties and defects of each part but marks the distinguishing species of each quality and assigns it suitable praise or blame a clear and distinct sentiment attends him through the whole survey of the objects and he discerns that very degree and kind of approbation or displeasure which each part is naturally fitted to produce the mist dissipates which seemed formerly to hang over the object the organ acquires greater perfection in its operations and can pronounce without danger of mistake concerning the merits of every performance in a word the same address and dexterity which practice gives to the execution of any work is also acquired by the same means in the judging of it so advantageous is practice to the discernment of beauty that before we can give judgment on any work of importance it will even be requisite that that very individual performance be more than once perused by us and be surveyed in different lights with attention and deliberation there is a flutter or hurry of thought which attends the first perusal of any piece and which confounds the genuine sentiment of beauty the relation of the parts is not discerned the true characters of style are little distinguished the several perfections and defects seem wrapped up in a species of confusion and present themselves indistinctly to the imagination not to mention that there is a species of beauty which as it is florid and superficial pleases at first but being found incompatible with a just expression either of reason or passion soon palls upon the taste and is then rejected with disdain at least rated at a much lower value it is impossible to continue in the practice of contemplating any order of beauty without being frequently obliged to form comparisons between the several species and degrees of excellence and estimating their proportion to each other a man who has had no opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beauty is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opinion with regard to any object presented to him by comparison alone we fix the epithets of praise or blame and learn how to assign the due degree of each the coarsest daubing contains a certain lustre of colours and exactness of imitation which are so far beauties and would affect the mind of a peasant or indian with the highest admiration the most vulgar ballads are not entirely destitute of harmony or nature and none but a person familiarized to superior beauties would pronounce their numbers harsh or narration uninteresting a great inferiority of beauty gives pain to a person conversant in the highest excellence of the kind and is for that reason pronounced a deformity as the most finished object with which we are acquainted is naturally supposed to have reached the pinnacle of perfection and to be entitled to the highest applause one accustomed to see and examine and weigh the several performances admired in different ages and nations can alone rate the merits of a work exhibited to his view and assign its proper rank among the productions of genius but to enable a critic the more fully to execute this undertaking he must preserve his mind free from all prejudice and allow nothing to enter into his consideration but the very object which is submitted to his examination we may observe that every work of art in order to produce its due effect on the mind must be surveyed in a certain point of view and cannot be fully relished by persons whose situation real or imaginary is not conformable to that which is required by the performance an orator addresses himself to a particular audience and must have a regard to their particular genius interests opinions passions and prejudices otherwise he hopes in vain to govern their resolutions and inflame their affections should they even have entertained some prepossessions against him however unreasonable he must not overlook this disadvantage but before he enters upon the subject must endeavour to conciliate their affection and acquire their good graces a critic of a different age or nation who should peruse this discourse must have all these circumstances in his eye and must place himself in the same situation as the audience in order to form a true judgment of the oration in like manner when any work is addressed to the public though should have a friendship or enmity with the author must depart from this situation and considering myself as a man in general forget if possible my individual being and my peculiar circumstances a person influenced by prejudice complies not with this condition but obstinately maintains his natural position without placing himself in that point of view which the performance supposes if the work be addressed to persons of a different age or nation he makes no allowance for their peculiar views and prejudices but full of the manners of his own age and country rashly condemns what seemed admirable in the eyes of those for whom alone the discourse was calculated if the work be executed for the public he never sufficiently enlarges his comprehension or forgets his interest as a friend or enemy as a rival or commentator by this means his sentiments are perverted nor have the same beauties and blemishes the same influence upon him as if he had imposed a proper violence on his imagination and had forgotten himself for a moment so far his taste evidently departs from the true standard and of consequence loses all credit and authority it is well known that in all questions submitted to the understanding prejudice is destructive of sound judgment and perverts all operations of the intellectual faculties it is no less contrary to good taste nor has it less influence to corrupt our sentiment of beauty it belongs to good sense to check its influence in both cases and in this respect as well as in many others reason if not an essential part of taste is at least requisite to the operations of this latter faculty in all the nobler productions of genius there is a mutual relation and correspondence of parts nor can either the beauties or blemishes be perceived by him whose thought is not capacious enough to comprehend all those parts and compare them with each other in order to perceive the consistence and uniformity of the whole every work of art has also a certain end or purpose for which it is calculated and is to be deemed more or less perfect as it is more or less fitted to attain this end the object of eloquence is to persuade of history to instruct of poetry to please by means of the passions and the imagination these ends we must carry constantly in our view when we peruse any performance and we must be able to judge how far the means employed are adapted to their respective purposes besides every kind of composition even the most poetical is nothing but a chain of propositions and reasonings not always indeed the justest and most exact but still plausible and specious however disguised by the colouring of the imagination the persons introduced in tragedy and epic poetry must be represented as reasoning and thinking and concluding and acting suitably to their character and circumstances and without judgment as well as taste and invention a poet can never hope to succeed in so delicate an undertaking not to mention that the same excellence of faculties which contributes to the improvement of reason the same clearness of conception the same exactness of distinction the same vivacity of apprehension are essential to the operations of true taste and are its infallible concomitants it seldom or never happens that a man of sense who has experience in any art cannot judge of its beauty and it is no less rare to meet with a man who has a just taste without a sound understanding thus though the principles of taste be universal and nearly if not entirely the same in all men yet few are qualified to give judgment on any work of art or establish their own sentiment as the standard of beauty the organs of internal sensation are seldom so perfect as to allow the general principles their full play and produce a feeling correspondent to those principles they either labour under some defect or are vitiated by some disorder and by that means excite a sentiment which may be pronounced erroneous when the critic has no delicacy he judges without any distinction and is only affected by the grosser and more palpable qualities of the object the finer touches pass unnoticed and disregarded where he is not aided by practice his verdict is attended with confusion and hesitation where no comparison has been employed the most frivolous beauties such as rather merit the name of defects are the object of his admiration where he lies under the influence of prejudice all his natural sentiments are perverted where good sense is wanting he is not qualified to discern the beauties of design and reasoning which are the highest and most excellent under some or other of these imperfections the generality of men labour and hence a true judge in the finer arts is observed even during the most polished ages to be so rare a character strong sense united to delicate sentiment improved by practice perfected by comparison and cleared of all prejudice can alone entitle critics to this valuable character and the joint verdict of such wherever they are to be found is the true standard of taste and beauty but where are such critics to be found by what marks are they to be known how distinguish them from pretenders these questions are embarrassing and seem to throw us back into the same uncertainty from which during the course of this essay we have endeavoured to extricate ourselves but if we consider the matter aright these are questions of fact not of sentiment whether any particular person be endowed with good sense and a delicate imagination free from prejudice may often be the subject of dispute and be liable to great discussion and enquiry but that such a character is valuable and estimable will be agreed in by all mankind where these doubts occur men can do no more than in other disputable questions which are submitted to the understanding they must produce the best arguments that their invention suggests to them they must acknowledge a true and decisive standard to exist somewhere to wit real existence and matter of fact and they must have indulgence to such as differ from them in their appeals to this standard it is sufficient for our present purpose if we have proved that the taste of all individuals is not upon an equal footing and that some men in general however difficult to be particularly pitched upon will be acknowledged by universal sentiment to have a preference above others but in reality the difficulty of finding even in particulars the standard of taste is not so great as it is represented though in speculation we may readily avow a certain criterion in science and deny it in sentiment the matter is found in practice to be much more hard to ascertain in the former case than in the latter theories of abstract philosophy systems of profound theology have prevailed during one age in a successive period these have been universally exploded their absurdity has been detected other theories and systems have supplied their place which again gave place to their successors and nothing has been experienced more liable to the revolutions of chance and fashion than these pretended decisions of science the case is not the same with the beauties of eloquence and poetry just expressions of passion and nature are sure after a little time to gain public applause which they maintain for ever aristotle and plato and epicurus and descartes may successively yield to each other but terence and virgil maintain an universal undisputed empire over the minds of men the abstract philosophy of cicero has lost its credit the vehemence of his oratory is still the object of our admiration though men of delicate taste be rare they are easily to be distinguished in society by the soundness of their understanding and the superiority of their faculties above the rest of mankind the ascendant which they acquire gives a prevalence to that lively approbation with which they receive any productions of genius and renders it generally predominant many men when left to themselves have but a faint and dubious perception of beauty who yet are capable of relishing any fine stroke which is pointed out to them every convert to the admiration of the real poet or orator is the cause of some new conversion and though prejudices may prevail for a time they never unite in celebrating any rival to the true genius but yield at last to the force of nature and just sentiment thus though a civilized nation may easily be mistaken in the choice of their admired philosopher they never have been found long to err in their affection for a favourite epic or tragic author but notwithstanding all our endeavours to fix a standard of taste and reconcile the discordant apprehensions of men there still remain two sources of variation which are not sufficient indeed to confound all the boundaries of beauty and deformity but will often serve to produce a difference in the degrees of our approbation or blame the one is the different humours of particular men the other the particular manners and opinions of our age and country the general principles of taste are uniform in human nature where men vary in their judgments some defect or perversion in the faculties may commonly be remarked proceeding either from prejudice from want of practice or want of delicacy and there is just reason for approving one taste and condemning another but where there is such a diversity in the internal frame or external situation as is entirely blameless on both sides and leaves no room to give one the preference above the other in that case a certain degree of diversity in judgment is unavoidable and we seek in vain for a standard by which we can reconcile the contrary sentiments a young man whose passions are warm will be more sensibly touched with amorous and tender images than a man more advanced in years who takes pleasure in wise philosophical reflections concerning the conduct of life and moderation of the passions at twenty ovid may be the favourite author horace at forty and perhaps tacitus at fifty vainly would we in such cases endeavour to enter into the sentiments of others and divest ourselves of those propensities which are natural to us we choose our favourite author as we do our friend from a conformity of humour and disposition mirth or passion sentiment or reflection whichever of these most predominates in our temper it gives us a peculiar sympathy with the writer who resembles us one person is more pleased with the sublime another with the tender a third with raillery one has a strong sensibility to blemishes and is extremely studious of correctness another has a more lively feeling of beauties and pardons twenty absurdities and defects for one elevated or pathetic stroke the ear of this man is entirely turned towards conciseness and energy that man is delighted with a copious rich and harmonious expression simplicity is affected by one ornament by another comedy tragedy satire odes have each its partizans who prefer that particular species of writing to all others it is plainly an error in a critic to confine his approbation to one species or style of writing and condemn all the rest but it is almost impossible not to feel a predilection for that which suits our particular turn and disposition such preferences are innocent and unavoidable and can never reasonably be the object of dispute because there is no standard by which they can be decided for a like reason we are more pleased in the course of our reading with pictures and characters that resemble objects which are found in our own age or country than with those which describe a different set of customs it is not without some effort that we reconcile ourselves to the simplicity of ancient manners and behold princesses carrying water from the spring and kings and heroes dressing their own victuals we may allow in general that the representation of such manners is no fault in the author nor deformity in the piece but we are not so sensibly touched with them for this reason comedy is not easily transferred from one age or nation to another a frenchman or englishman is not pleased with the andria of terence or clitia of machiavel where the fine lady upon whom all the play turns never once appears to the spectators but is always kept behind the scenes suitably to the reserved humour of the ancient greeks and modern italians a man of learning and reflection can make allowance for these peculiarities of manners but a common audience can never divest themselves so far of their usual ideas and sentiments as to relish pictures which no wise resemble them but here there occurs a reflection which may perhaps be useful in examining the celebrated controversy concerning ancient and modern learning where we often find the one side excusing any seeming absurdity in the ancients from the manners of the age and the other refusing to admit this excuse or at least admitting it only as an apology for the author not for the performance in my opinion the proper boundaries in this subject have seldom been fixed between the contending parties where any innocent peculiarities of manners are represented such as those above mentioned they ought certainly to be admitted and a man who is shocked with them gives an evident proof of false delicacy and refinement the poets monument more durable than brass must fall to the ground like common brick or clay were men to make no allowance for the continual revolutions of manners and customs and would admit of nothing but what was suitable to the prevailing fashion must we throw aside the pictures of our ancestors because of their ruffs and fardingales but where the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another and where vicious manners are described without being marked with the proper characters of blame and disapprobation this must be allowed to disfigure the poem and to be a real deformity cannot nor is it proper should enter into such sentiments and however may excuse the poet on account of the manners of his age never can relish the composition the want of humanity and of decency so conspicuous in the characters drawn by several of the ancient poets even sometimes by homer and the greek tragedians diminishes considerably the merit of their noble performances and gives modern authors an advantage over them we are not interested in the fortunes and sentiments of such rough heroes we are displeased to find the limits of vice and virtue so much confounded and whatever indulgence we may give to the writer on account of his prejudices we cannot prevail on ourselves to enter into his sentiments or bear an affection to characters which we plainly discover to be blameable the case is not the same with moral principles as with speculative opinions of any kind these are in continual flux and revolution the son embraces a different system from the father nay there scarcely is any man who can boast of great constancy and uniformity in this particular whatever speculative errors may be found in the polite writings of any age or country they detract but little from the value of those compositions there needs but a certain turn of thought or imagination to make us enter into all the opinions which then prevailed and relish the sentiments or conclusions derived from them but a very violent effort is requisite to change our judgment of manners and excite sentiments of approbation or blame love or hatred different from those to which the mind from long custom has been familiarized and where a man is confident of the rectitude of that moral standard by which he judges he is justly jealous of it and will not pervert the sentiments of his heart for a moment in complaisance to any writer whatsoever of all speculative errors those which regard religion are the most excusable in compositions of genius nor is it ever permitted to judge of the civility or wisdom of any people or even of single persons by the grossness or refinement of their theological principles the same good sense that directs men in the ordinary occurrences of life is not hearkened to in religious matters which are supposed to be placed altogether above the cognizance of human reason on this account all the absurdities of the pagan system of theology must be overlooked by every critic who would pretend to form a just notion of ancient poetry and our posterity in their turn must have the same indulgence to their forefathers no religious principles can ever be imputed as a fault to any poet while they remain merely principles and take not such strong possession of his heart as to lay him under the imputation of bigotry or superstition where that happens they confound the sentiments of morality and alter the natural boundaries of vice and virtue they are therefore eternal blemishes according to the principle abovementioned nor are the prejudices and false opinions of the age sufficient to justify them it is essential to the roman catholic religion to inspire a violent hatred of every other worship and to represent all pagans mahometans and heretics as the objects of divine wrath and vengeance such sentiments though they are in reality very blameable are considered as virtues by the zealots of that communion and are represented in their tragedies and epic poems as a kind of divine heroism this bigotry has disfigured two very fine tragedies of the french theatre polieucte and athalia where an intemperate zeal for particular modes of worship is set off with all the pomp imaginable and forms the predominant character of the heroes what is this says the sublime joad to josabet finding her in discourse with mathan the priest of baal does the daughter of david speak to this traitor are you not afraid lest the earth should open and pour forth flames to devour you both or lest these holy walls should fall and crush you together what is his purpose why comes that enemy of god hither to poison the air which we breathe with his horrid presence such sentiments are received with great applause on the theatre of paris but at london the spectators would be full as much pleased to hear achilles tell agamemnon that he was a dog in his forehead and a deer in his heart or jupiter threaten juno with a sound drubbing if she will not be quiet religious principles are also a blemish in any polite composition when they rise up to superstition and intrude themselves into every sentiment however remote from any connection with religion it is no excuse for the poet that the customs of his country had burthened life with so many religious ceremonies and observances that no part of it was exempt from that yoke it must for ever be ridiculous in petrarch to compare his mistress laura to jesus christ nor is it less ridiculous in that agreeable libertine boccace very seriously to give thanks to god almighty and the ladies for their assistance in defending him against his enemies essays moral political and literary part part essays moral political and literary essay of commerce the greater part of mankind may be divided into two classes that of shallow thinkers who fall short of the truth and that of abstruse thinkers who go beyond it the latter class are by far the most rare and may add by far the most useful and valuable they suggest hints at least and start difficulties which they want perhaps skill to pursue but which may produce fine discoveries when handled by men who have a more just way of thinking at worst what they say is uncommon and if it should cost some pains to comprehend it one has however the pleasure of hearing something that is new an author is little to be valued who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffeehouse conversation all people of shallow thought are apt to decry even those of solid understanding as abstruse thinkers and metaphysicians and refiners and never will allow any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak conceptions there are some cases own where an extraordinary refinement affords a strong presumption of falsehood and where no reasoning is to be trusted but what is natural and easy when a man deliberates concerning his conduct in any particular affair and forms schemes in politics trade œconomy or any business in life he never ought to draw his arguments too fine or connect too long a chain of consequences together something is sure to happen that will disconcert his reasoning and produce an event different from what he expected but when we reason upon general subjects one may justly affirm that our speculations can scarcely ever be too fine provided they be just and that the difference between a common man and a man of genius is chiefly seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they proceed general reasonings seem intricate merely because they are general nor is it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish in a great number of particulars that common circumstance in which they all agree or to extract it pure and unmixed from the other superfluous circumstances every judgment or conclusion with them is particular they cannot enlarge their view to those universal propositions which comprehend under them an infinite number of individuals and include a whole science in a single theorem their eye is confounded with such an extensive prospect and the conclusions derived from it even though clearly expressed seem intricate and obscure but however intricate they may seem it is certain that general principles if just and sound must always prevail in the general course of things though they may fail in particular cases and it is the chief business of philosophers to regard the general course of things may add that it is also the chief business of politicians especially in the domestic government of the state where the public good which is or ought to be their object depends on the concurrence of a multitude of causes not as in foreign politics on accidents and chances and the caprices of a few persons this therefore makes the difference between particular deliberations and general reasonings and renders subtilty and refinement much more suitable to the latter than to the former thought this introduction necessary before the following discourses on commerce money interest balance of trade ca where perhaps there will occur some principles which are uncommon and which may seem too refined and subtile for such vulgar subjects if false let them be rejected but no one ought to entertain a prejudice against them merely because they are out of the common road the greatness of a state and the happiness of its subjects how independent soever they may be supposed in some respects are commonly allowed to be inseparable with regard to commerce and as private men receive greater security in the possession of their trade and riches from the power of the public so the public becomes powerful in proportion to the opulence and extensive commerce of private men this maxim is true in general though cannot forbear thinking that it may possibly admit of exceptions and that we often establish it with too little reserve and limitation there may be some circumstances where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals instead of adding strength to the public will serve only to thin its armies and diminish its authority among the neighbouring nations man is a very variable being and susceptible of many different opinions principles and rules of conduct what may be true while he adheres to one way of thinking will be found false when he has embraced an opposite set of manners and opinions the bulk of every state may be divided into husbandmen and manufacturers the former are employed in the culture of the land the latter work up the materials furnished by the former into all the commodities which are necessary or ornamental to human life as soon as men quit their savage state where they live chiefly by hunting and fishing they must fall into these two classes though the arts of agriculture employ at first the most numerous part of the society time and experience improve so much these arts that the land may easily maintain a much greater number of men than those who are immediately employed in its culture or who furnish the more necessary manufactures to such as are so employed if these superfluous hands apply themselves to the finer arts which are commonly denominated the arts of luxury they add to the happiness of the state since they afford to many the opportunity of receiving enjoyments with which they would otherwise have been unacquainted but may not another scheme be proposed for the employment of these superfluous hands may not the sovereign lay claim to them and employ them in fleets and armies to encrease the dominions of the state abroad and spread its fame over distant nations it is certain that the fewer desires and wants are found in the proprietors and labourers of land the fewer hands do they employ and consequently the superfluities of the land instead of maintaining tradesmen and manufacturers may support fleets and armies to a much greater extent than where a great many arts are required to minister to the luxury of particular persons here therefore seems to be a kind of opposition between the greatness of the state and the happiness of the subject a state is never greater than when all its superfluous hands are employed in the service of the public the ease and convenience of private persons require that these hands should be employed in their service the one can never be satisfied but at the expence of the other as the ambition of the sovereign must entrench on the luxury of individuals so the luxury of individuals must diminish the force and check the ambition of the sovereign nor is this reasoning merely chimerical but is founded on history and experience the republic of sparta was certainly more powerful than any state now in the world consisting of an equal number of people and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce and luxury the helotes were the labourers the spartans were the soldiers or gentlemen it is evident that the labour of the helotes could not have maintained so great a number of spartans had these latter lived in ease and delicacy and given employment to a great variety of trades and manufactures the like policy may be remarked in rome and indeed throughout all ancient history it is observable that the smallest republics raised and maintained greater armies than states consisting of triple the number of inhabitants are able to support at present it is computed that in all european nations the proportion between soldiers and people does not exceed one to a hundred but we read that the city of rome alone with its small territory raised and maintained in early times ten legions against the latinsathens the whole of whose dominions was not larger than yorkshire sent to the expedition against sicily near forty thousand mendionysius the elder it is said maintained a standing army of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse besides a large fleet of four hundred sail though his territories extended no farther than the city of syracuse about a third of the island of sicily and some seaport towns and garrisons on the coast of italy and illyricum it is true the ancient armies in time of war subsisted much upon plunder but did not the enemy plunder in their turn which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax than any other that could be devised in short no probable reason can be assigned for the great power of the more ancient states above the modern but their want of commerce and luxury few artizans were maintained by the labour of the farmers and therefore more soldiers might live upon it livy says that rome in his time would find it difficult to raise as large an army as that which in her early days she sent out against the gauls and latins instead of those soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in camilluss time there were in augustuss days musicians painters cooks players and tailors and if the land was equally cultivated at both periods it could certainly maintain equal numbers in the one profession as in the other they added nothing to the mere necessaries of life in the latter period more than in the former it is natural on this occasion to ask whether sovereigns may not return to the maxims of ancient policy and consult their own interest in this respect more than the happiness of their subjects answer that it appears to me almost impossible and that because ancient policy was violent and contrary to the more natural and usual course of things it is well known with what peculiar laws sparta was governed and what a prodigy that republic is justly esteemed by every one who has considered human nature as it has displayed itself in other nations and other ages were the testimony of history less positive and circumstantial such a government would appear a mere philosophical whim or fiction and impossible ever to be reduced to practice and though the roman and other ancient republics were supported on principles somewhat more natural yet was there an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burthens they were free states they were small ones and the age being martial all their neighbours were continually in arms freedom naturally begets public spirit especially in small states and this public spirit this amor patriæ must encrease when the public is almost in continual alarm and men are obliged every moment to expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defence a continual succession of wars makes every citizen a soldier he takes the field in his turn and during his service he is chiefly maintained by himself this service is indeed equivalent to a heavy tax yet is it less felt by a people addicted to arms who fight for honour and revenge more than pay and are unacquainted with gain and industry as well as pleasure not to mention the great equality of fortunes among the inhabitants of the ancient republics where every field belonging to a different proprietor was able to maintain a family and rendered the numbers of citizens very considerable even without trade and manufactures but though the want of trade and manufactures among a free and very martial people may sometimes have no other effect than to render the public more powerful it is certain that in the common course of human affairs it will have a quite contrary tendency sovereigns must take mankind as they find them and cannot pretend to introduce any violent change in their principles and ways of thinking a long course of time with a variety of accidents and circumstances are requisite to produce those great revolutions which so much diversify the face of human affairs and the less natural any set of principles are which support a particular society the more difficulty will a legislator meet with in raising and cultivating them it is his best policy to comply with the common bent of mankind and give it all the improvements of which it is susceptible now according to the most natural course of things industry and arts and trade encrease the power of the sovereign as well as the happiness of the subjects and that policy is violent which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of individuals this will easily appear from a few considerations which will present to us the consequences of sloth and barbarity where manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated the bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture and if their skill and industry encrease there must arise a great superfluity from their labour beyond what suffices to maintain them they have no temptation therefore to encrease their skill and industry since they cannot exchange that superfluity for any commodities which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity a habit of indolence naturally prevails the greater part of the land lies uncultivated what is cultivated yields not its utmost for want of skill and assiduity in the farmers if at any time the public exigencies require that great numbers should be employed in the public service the labour of the people furnishes now no superfluities by which these numbers can be maintained the labourers cannot encrease their skill and industry on a sudden lands uncultivated cannot be brought into tillage for some years the armies mean while must either make sudden and violent conquests or disband for want of subsistence a regular attack or defence therefore is not to be expected from such a people and their soldiers must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers and manufacturers every thing in the world is purchased by labour and our passions are the only causes of labour when a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts the proprietors of land as well as the farmers study agriculture as a science and redouble their industry and attention the superfluity which arises from their labour is not lost but is exchanged with manufactures for those commodities which mens luxury now makes them covet by this means land furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life than what suffices for those who cultivate it in times of peace and tranquillity this superfluity goes to the maintenance of manufacturers and the improvers of liberal arts but it is easy for the public to convert many of these manufacturers into soldiers and maintain them by that superfluity which arises from the labour of the farmers accordingly we find that this is the case in all civilized governments when the sovereign raises an army what is the consequence he imposes a tax this tax obliges all the people to retrench what is least necessary to their subsistence those who labour in such commodities must either enlist in the troops or turn themselves to agriculture and thereby oblige some labourers to enlist for want of business and to consider the matter abstractedly manufactures encrease the power of the state only as they store up so much labour and that of a kind to which the public may lay claim without depriving any one of the necessaries of life the more labour therefore is employed beyond mere necessaries the more powerful is any state since the persons engaged in that labour may easily be converted to the public service in a state without manufactures there may be the same number of hands but there is not the same quantity of labour nor of the same kind all the labour is there bestowed upon necessaries which can admit of little or no abatement thus the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the state are in a great measure united with regard to trade and manufactures it is a violent method and in most cases impracticable to oblige the labourer to toil in order to raise from the land more than what subsists himself and family furnish him with manufactures and commodities and he will do it of himself afterwards you will find it easy to seize some part of his superfluous labour and employ it in the public service without giving him his wonted return being accustomed to industry he will think this less grievous than if at once you obliged him to an augmentation of labour without any reward the case is the same with regard to the other members of the state the greater is the stock of labour of all kinds the greater quantity may be taken from the heap without making any sensible alteration in it a public granary of corn a storehouse of cloth a magazine of arms all these must be allowed real riches and strength in any state trade and industry are really nothing but a stock of labour which in times of peace and tranquillity is employed for the ease and satisfaction of individuals but in the exigencies of state may in part be turned to public advantage could we convert a city into a kind of fortified camp and infuse into each breast so martial a genius and such a passion for public good as to make every one willing to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of the public these affections might now as in ancient times prove alone a sufficient spur to industry and support the community it would then be advantageous as in camps to banish all arts and luxury and by restrictions on equipage and tables make the provisions and forage last longer than if the army were loaded with a number of superfluous retainers but as these principles are too disinterested and too difficult to support it is requisite to govern men by other passions and animate them with a spirit of avarice and industry art and luxury the camp is in this case loaded with a superfluous retinue but the provisions flow in proportionably larger the harmony of the whole is still supported and the natural bent of the mind being more complied with individuals as well as the public find their account in the observance of those maxims the same method of reasoning will let us see the advantage of foreign commerce in augmenting the power of the state as well as the riches and happiness of the subject it encreases the stock of labour in the nation and the sovereign may convert what share of it he finds necessary to the service of the public foreign trade by its imports furnishes materials for new manufactures and by its exports it produces labour in particular commodities which could not be consumed at home in short a kingdom that has a large import and export must abound more with industry and that employed upon delicacies and luxuries than a kingdom which rests contented with its native commodities it is therefore more powerful as well as richer and happier the individuals reap the benefit of these commodities so far as they gratify the senses and appetites and the public is also a gainer while a greater stock of labour is by this means stored up against any public exigency that is a greater number of laborious men are maintained who may be diverted to the public service without robbing any one of the necessaries or even the chief conveniencies of life if we consult history we shall find that in most nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures and given birth to domestic luxury the temptation is stronger to make use of foreign commodities which are ready for use and which are entirely new to us than to make improvements on any domestic commodity which always advance by slow degrees and never affect us by their novelty the profit is also very great in exporting what is superfluous at home and what bears no price to foreign nations whose soil or climate is not favourable to that commodity thus men become acquainted with the pleasures of luxury and the profits of commerce and their delicacy and industry being once awakened carry them on to farther improvements in every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade and this perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from a commerce with strangers it rouses men from their indolence and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury which they never before dreamed of raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoyed and at the same time the few merchants who possess the secret of this importation and exportation make great profits and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce imitation soon diffuses all those arts while domestic manufactures emulate the foreign in their improvements and work up every home commodity to the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible their own steel and iron in such laborious hands become equal to the gold and rubies of the indies when the affairs of the society are once brought to this situation a nation may lose most of its foreign trade and yet continue a great and powerful people if strangers will not take any particular commodity of ours we must cease to labour in it the same hands will turn themselves towards some refinement in other commodities which may be wanted at home and there must always be materials for them to work upon till every person in the state who possesses riches enjoys as great plenty of home commodities and those in as great perfection as he desires which can never possibly happen china is represented as one of the most flourishing empires in the world though it has very little commerce beyond its own territories it will not hope be considered as a superfluous digression if here observe that as the multitude of mechanical arts is advantageous so is the great number of persons to whose share the productions of these arts fall a too great disproportion among the citizens weakens any state every person if possible ought to enjoy the fruits of his labour in a full possession of all the necessaries and many of the conveniencies of life no one can doubt but such an equality is most suitable to human nature and diminishes much less from the happiness of the rich than it adds to that of the poor it also augments the power of the state and makes any extraordinary taxes or impositions be paid with more chearfulness where the riches are engrossed by a few these must contribute very largely to the supplying of the public necessities but when the riches are dispersed among multitudes the burthen feels light on every shoulder and the taxes make not a very sensible difference on any ones way of living add to this that where the riches are in few hands these must enjoy all the power and will readily conspire to lay the whole burthen on the poor and oppress them still farther to the discouragement of all industry in this circumstance consists the great advantage of england above any nation at present in the world or that appears in the records of any story it is true the english feel some disadvantages in foreign trade by the high price of labour which is in part the effect of the riches of their artisans as well as of the plenty of money but as foreign trade is not the most material circumstance it is not to be put in competition with the happiness of so many millions and if there were no more to endear to them that free government under which they live this alone were sufficient the poverty of the common people is a natural if not an infallible effect of absolute monarchy though doubt whether it be always true on the other hand that their riches are an infallible result of liberty liberty must be attended with particular accidents and a certain turn of thinking in order to produce that effect lord bacon accounting for the great advantages obtained by the english in their wars with france ascribes them chiefly to the superior ease and plenty of the common people amongst the former yet the government of the two kingdoms was at that time pretty much alike where the labourers and artisans are accustomed to work for low wages and to retain but a small part of the fruits of their labour it is difficult for them even in a free government to better their condition or conspire among themselves to heighten their wages but even where they are accustomed to a more plentiful way of life it is easy for the rich in an arbitrary government to conspire against them and throw the whole burthen of the taxes on their shoulders it may seem an odd position that the poverty of the common people in france italy and spain is in some measure owing to the superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate yet there want not reasons to justify this paradox in such a fine mould or soil as that of those more southern regions agriculture is an easy art and one man with a couple of sorry horses will be able in a season to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty considerable rent to the proprietor all the art which the farmer knows is to leave his ground fallow for a year as soon as it is exhausted and the warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich it and restore its fertility such poor peasants therefore require only a simple maintenance for their labour they have no stock or riches which claim more and at the same time they are for ever dependant on their landlord who gives no leases nor fears that his land will be spoiled by the ill methods of cultivation in england the land is rich but coarse must be cultivated at a great expence and produces slender crops when not carefully managed and by a method which gives not the full profit but in a course of several years a farmer therefore in england must have a considerable stock and a long lease which beget proportional profits the fine vineyards of champagne and burgundy that often yield to the landlord above five pounds per acre are cultivated by peasants who have scarcely bread the reason is that such peasants need no stock but their own limbs with instruments of husbandry which they can buy for twenty shillings the farmers are commonly in some better circumstances in those countries but the grasiers are most at their ease of all those who cultivate the land the reason is still the same men must have profits proportionable to their expence and hazard where so considerable a number of the labouring poor as the peasants and farmers are in very low circumstances all the rest must partake of their poverty whether the government of that nation be monarchical or republican we may form a similar remark with regard to the general history of mankind what is the reason why no people living between the tropics could ever yet attain to any art or civility or reach even any police in their government and any military discipline while few nations in the temperate climates have been altogether deprived of these advantages it is probable that one cause of this phænomenon is the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid zone which render clothes and houses less requisite for the inhabitants and thereby remove in part that necessity which is the great spur to industry and invention curis acuens mortalia corda not to mention that the fewer goods or possessions of this kind any people enjoy the fewer quarrels are likely to arise amongst them and the less necessity will there be for a settled police or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies or from each other essay of refinement in the artsa luxury is a word of an uncertain signification and may be taken in a good as well as in a bad sense in general it means great refinement in the gratification of the senses and any degree of it may be innocent or blameable according to the age or country or condition of the person the bounds between the virtue and the vice cannot here be exactly fixed more than in other moral subjects to imagine that the gratifying of any sense or the indulging of any delicacy in meat drink or apparel is of itself a vice can never enter into a head that is not disordered by the frenzies of enthusiasm have indeed heard of a monk abroad who because the windows of his cell opened upon a noble prospect made a covenant with his eyes never to turn that way or receive so sensual a gratification and such is the crime of drinking champagne or burgundy preferably to small beer or porter these indulgences are only vices when they are pursued at the expence of some virtue as liberality or charity in like manner as they are follies when for them a man ruins his fortune and reduces himself to want and beggary where they entrench upon no virtue but leave ample subject whence to provide for friends family and every proper object of generosity or compassion they are entirely innocent and have in every age been acknowledged such by almost all moralists to be entirely occupied with the luxury of the table for instance without any relish for the pleasures of ambition study or conversation is a mark of stupidity and is incompatible with any vigour of temper or genius to confine ones expence entirely to such a gratification without regard to friends or family is an indication of a heart destitute of humanity or benevolence but if a man reserve time sufficient for all laudable pursuits and money sufficient for all generous purposes he is free from every shadow of blame or reproach since luxury may be considered either as innocent or blameable one may be surprized at those preposterous opinions which have been entertained concerning it while men of libertine principles bestow praises even on vicious luxury and represent it as highly advantageous to society and on the other hand men of severe morals blame even the most innocent luxury and represent it as the source of all the corruptions disorders and factions incident to civil government we shall here endeavour to correct both these extremes by proving first that the ages of refinement are both the happiest and most virtuous secondly that wherever luxury ceases to be innocent it also ceases to be beneficial and when carried a degree too far is a quality pernicious though perhaps not the most pernicious to political society to prove the first point we need but consider the effects of refinement both on private and on public life human happiness according to the most received notions seems to consist in three ingredients action pleasure and indolence and though these ingredients ought to be mixed in different proportions according to the particular disposition of the person yet no one ingredient can be entirely wanting without destroying in some measure the relish of the whole composition indolence or repose indeed seems not of itself to contribute much to our enjoyment but like sleep is requisite as an indulgence to the weakness of human nature which cannot support an uninterrupted course of business or pleasure that quick march of the spirits which takes a man from himself and chiefly gives satisfaction does in the end exhaust the mind and requires some intervals of repose which though agreeable for a moment yet if prolonged beget a languor and lethargy that destroys all enjoyment education custom and example have a mighty influence in turning the mind to any of these pursuits and it must be owned that where they promote a relish for action and pleasure they are so far favourable to human happiness in times when industry and the arts flourish men are kept in perpetual occupation and enjoy as their reward the occupation itself as well as those pleasures which are the fruit of their labour the mind acquires new vigour enlarges its powers and faculties and by an assiduity in honest industry both satisfies its natural appetites and prevents the growth of unnatural ones which commonly spring up when nourished by ease and idleness banish those arts from society you deprive men both of action and of pleasure and leaving nothing but indolence in their place you even destroy the relish of indolence which never is agreeable but when it succeeds to labour and recruits the spirits exhausted by too much application and fatigue another advantage of industry and of refinements in the mechanical arts is that they commonly produce some refinements in the liberal nor can one be carried to perfection without being accompanied in some degree with the other the same age which produces great philosophers and politicians renowned generals and poets usually abounds with skilful weavers and shipcarpenters we cannot reasonably expect that a piece of woollen cloth will be wrought to perfection in a nation which is ignorant of astronomy or where ethics are neglected the spirit of the age affects all the arts and the minds of men being once roused from their lethargy and put into a fermentation turn themselves on all sides and carry improvements into every art and science profound ignorance is totally banished and men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures to think as well as to act to cultivate the pleasures of the mind as well as those of the body the more these refined arts advance the more sociable men become nor is it possible that when enriched with science and possessed of a fund of conversation they should be contented to remain in solitude or live with their fellowcitizens in that distant manner which is peculiar to ignorant and barbarous nations they flock into cities love to receive and communicate knowledge to show their wit or their breeding their taste in conversation or living in clothes or furniture curiosity allures the wise vanity the foolish and pleasure both particular clubs and societies are every where formed both sexes meet in an easy and sociable manner and the tempers of men as well as their behaviour refine apace so that beside the improvements which they receive from knowledge and the liberal arts it is impossible but they must feel an encrease of humanity from the very habit of conversing together and contributing to each others pleasure and entertainment thus industry knowledge and humanity are linked together by an indissoluble chain and are found from experience as well as reason to be peculiar to the more polished and what are commonly denominated the more luxurious ages nor are these advantages attended with disadvantages that bear any proportion to them the more men refine upon pleasure the less will they indulge in excesses of any kind because nothing is more destructive to true pleasure than such excesses one may safely affirm that the tartars are oftener guilty of beastly gluttony when they feast on their dead horses than european courtiers with all their refinements of cookery and if libertine love or even infidelity to the marriagebed be more frequent in polite ages when it is often regarded only as a piece of gallantry drunkenness on the other hand is much less common a vice more odious and more pernicious both to mind and body and in this matter would appeal not only to an ovid or a petronius but to a seneca or a cato we know that cæsar during catilines conspiracy being necessitated to put into catos hands a billetdoux which discovered an intrigue with servilia catos own sister that stern philosopher threw it back to him with indignation and in the bitterness of his wrath gave him the appellation of drunkard as a term more opprobrious than that with which he could more justly have reproached him but industry knowledge and humanity are not advantageous in private life alone they diffuse their beneficial influence on the public and render the government as great and flourishing as they make individuals happy and prosperous the encrease and consumption of all the commodities which serve to the ornament and pleasure of life are advantageous to society because at the same time that they multiply those innocent gratifications to individuals they are a kind of storehouse of labour which in the exigencies of state may be turned to the public service in a nation where there is no demand for such superfluities men sink into indolence lose all enjoyment of life and are useless to the public which cannot maintain or support its fleets and armies from the industry of such slothful members the bounds of all the european kingdoms are at present nearly the same they were two hundred years ago but what a difference is there in the power and grandeur of those kingdoms which can be ascribed to nothing but the encrease of art and industry when charles of france invaded italy he carried with him about men yet this armament so exhausted the nation as we learn from guicciardin that for some years it was not able to make so great an effort the late king of france in time of war kept in pay above men though from mazarines death to his own he was engaged in a course of wars that lasted near thirty years this industry is much promoted by the knowledge inseparable from ages of art and refinement as on the other hand this knowledge enables the public to make the best advantage of the industry of its subjects laws order police discipline these can never be carried to any degree of perfection before human reason has refined itself by exercise and by an application to the more vulgar arts at least of commerce and manufacture can we expect that a government will be well modelled by a people who know not how to make a spinningwheel or to employ a loom to advantage not to mention that all ignorant ages are infested with superstition which throws the government off its bias and disturbs men in the pursuit of their interest and happiness knowledge in the arts of government naturally begets mildness and moderation by instructing men in the advantages of humane maxims above rigour and severity which drive subjects into rebellion and make the return to submission impracticable by cutting off all hopes of pardon when the tempers of men are softened as well as their knowledge improved this humanity appears still more conspicuous and is the chief characteristic which distinguishes a civilized age from times of barbarity and ignorance factions are then less inveterate revolutions less tragical authority less severe and seditions less frequent even foreign wars abate of their cruelty and after the field of battle where honour and interest steel men against compassion as well as fear the combatants divest themselves of the brute and resume the man nor need we fear that men by losing their ferocity will lose their martial spirit or become less undaunted and vigorous in defence of their country or their liberty the arts have no such effect in enervating either the mind or body on the contrary industry their inseparable attendant adds new force to both and if anger which is said to be the whetstone of courage loses somewhat of its asperity by politeness and refinement a sense of honour which is a stronger more constant and more governable principle acquires fresh vigour by that elevation of genius which arises from knowledge and a good education add to this that courage can neither have any duration nor be of any use when not accompanied with discipline and martial skill which are seldom found among a barbarous people the ancients remarked that datames was the only barbarian that ever knew the art of war and pyrrhus seeing the romans marshal their army with some art and skill said with surprize these barbarians have nothing barbarous in their discipline it is observable that as the old romans by applying themselves solely to war were almost the only uncivilized people that ever possessed military discipline so the modern italians are the only civilized people among europeans that ever wanted courage and a martial spirit those who would ascribe this effeminacy of the italians to their luxury or politeness or application to the arts need but consider the french and english whose bravery is as uncontestable as their love for the arts and their assiduity in commerce the italian historians give us a more satisfactory reason for this degeneracy of their countrymen they shew us how the sword was dropped at once by all the italian sovereigns while the venetian aristocracy was jealous of its subjects the florentine democracy applied itself entirely to commerce rome was governed by priests and naples by women war then became the business of soldiers of fortune who spared one another and to the astonishment of the world could engage a whole day in what they called a battle and return at night to their camp without the least bloodshed what has chiefly induced severe moralists to declaim against refinement in the arts is the example of ancient rome which joining to its poverty and rusticity virtue and public spirit rose to such a surprizing height of grandeur and liberty but having learned from its conquered provinces b the asiatic luxury fell into every kind of corruption whence arose sedition and civil wars attended at last with the total loss of liberty all the latin classics whom we peruse in our infancy are full of these sentiments and universally ascribe the ruin of their state to the arts and riches imported from the east insomuch that sallust represents a taste for painting as a vice no less than lewdness and drinking and so popular were these sentiments during the later ages of the republic that this author abounds in praises of the old rigid roman virtue though himself the most egregious instance of modern luxury and corruption speaks contemptuously of the grecian eloquence though the most elegant writer in the world nay employs preposterous digressions and declamations to this purpose though a model of taste and correctness but it would be easy to prove that these writers mistook the cause of the disorders in the roman state and ascribed to luxury and the arts what really proceeded from an ill modelled government and the unlimited extent of conquests c refinement on the pleasures and conveniencies of life has no natural tendency to beget venality and corruption the value which all men put upon any particular pleasure depends on comparison and experience nor is a porter less greedy of money which he spends on bacon and brandy than a courtier who purchases champagne and ortolans riches are valuable at all times and to all men because they always purchase pleasures such as men are accustomed to and desire nor can any thing restrain or regulate the love of money but a sense of honour and virtue which if it be not nearly equal at all times will naturally abound most in ages of knowledge and refinement of all european kingdoms poland seems the most defective in the arts of war as well as peace mechanical as well as liberal yet it is there that venality and corruption do most prevail the nobles seem to have preserved their crown elective for no other purpose than regularly to sell it to the highest bidder this is almost the only species of commerce with which that people are acquainted the liberties of england so far from decaying since the improvements in the arts have never flourished so much as during that period and though corruption may seem to encrease of late years this is chiefly to be ascribed to our established liberty when our princes have found the impossibility of governing without parliaments or of terrifying parliaments by the phantom of prerogative not to mention that this corruption or venality prevails much more among the electors than the elected and therefore cannot justly be ascribed to any refinements in luxury if we consider the matter in a proper light we shall find that a progress in the arts is rather favourable to liberty and has a natural tendency to preserve if not produce a free government in rude unpolished nations where the arts are neglected all labour is bestowed on the cultivation of the ground and the whole society is divided into two classes proprietors of land and their vassals or tenants the latter are necessarily dependent and fitted for slavery and subjection especially where they possess no riches and are not valued for their knowledge in agriculture as must always be the case where the arts are neglected the former naturally erect themselves into petty tyrants and must either submit to an absolute master for the sake of peace and order or if they will preserve their independency like the d ancient barons they must fall into feuds and contests among themselves and throw the whole society into such confusion as is perhaps worse than the most despotic government but where luxury nourishes commerce and industry the peasants by a proper cultivation of the land become rich and independent while the tradesmen and merchants acquire a share of the property and draw authority and consideration to that middling rank of men who are the best and firmest basis of public liberty these submit not to slavery like the peasants from poverty and meanness of spirit and having no hopes of tyrannizing over others like the barons they are not tempted for the sake of that gratification to submit to the tyranny of their sovereign they covet equal laws which may secure their property and preserve them from monarchical as well as aristocratical tyranny the lower house is the support of our popular government and all the world acknowledges that it owed its chief influence and consideration to the encrease of commerce which threw such a balance of property into the hands of the commons how inconsistent then is it to blame so violently a refinement in the arts and to represent it as the bane of liberty and public spirit to declaim against present times and magnify the virtue of remote ancestors is a propensity almost inherent in human nature and as the sentiments and opinions of civilized ages alone are transmitted to posterity hence it is that we meet with so many severe judgments pronounced against luxury and even science and hence it is that at present we give so ready an assent to them but the fallacy is easily perceived by comparing different nations that are contemporaries where we both judge more impartially and can better set in opposition those manners with which we are sufficiently acquainted treachery and cruelty the most pernicious and most odious of all vices seem peculiar to uncivilized ages and by the refined greeks and romans were ascribed to all the barbarous nations which surrounded them they might justly therefore have presumed that their own ancestors so highly celebrated possessed no greater virtue and were as much inferior to their posterity in honour and humanity as in taste and science an ancient frank or saxon may be highly extolled but believe every man would think his life or fortune much less secure in the hands of a moor or tartar than in those of a french or english gentleman the rank of men the most civilized in the most civilized nations we come now to the second position which we proposed to illustrate to wit that as innocent luxury or a refinement in the arts and conveniencies of life is advantageous to the public so wherever luxury ceases to be innocent it also ceases to be beneficial and when carried a degree farther begins to be a quality pernicious though perhaps not the most pernicious to political society let us consider what we call vicious luxury no gratification however sensual can of itself be esteemed vicious a gratification is only vicious when it engrosses all a mans expence and leaves no ability for such acts of duty and generosity as are required by his situation and fortune suppose that he correct the vice and employ part of his expence in the education of his children in the support of his friends and in relieving the poor would any prejudice result to society on the contrary the same consumption would arise and that labour which at present is employed only in producing a slender gratification to one man would relieve the necessitous and bestow satisfaction on hundreds the same care and toil that raise a dish of peas at christmas would give bread to a whole family during six months to say that without a vicious luxury the labour would not have been employed at all is only to say that there is some other defect in human nature such as indolence selfishness inattention to others for which luxury in some measure provides a remedy as one poison may be an antidote to another but virtue like wholesome food is better than poisons however corrected suppose the same number of men that are at present in great britain with the same soil and climate ask is it not possible for them to be happier by the most perfect way of life that can be imagined and by the greatest reformation that omnipotence itself could work in their temper and disposition to assert that they cannot appears evidently ridiculous as the land is able to maintain more than all its present inhabitants they could never in such a utopian state feel any other ills than those which arise from bodily sickness and these are not the half of human miseries all other ills spring from some vice either in ourselves or others and even many of our diseases proceed from the same origin remove the vices and the ills follow you must only take care to remove all the vices if you remove part you may render the matter worse by banishing vicious luxury without curing sloth and an indifference to others you only diminish industry in the state and add nothing to mens charity or their generosity let us therefore rest contented with asserting that two opposite vices in a state may be more advantageous than either of them alone but let us never pronounce vice in itself advantageous is it not very inconsistent for an author to assert in one page that moral distinctions are inventions of politicians for public interest and in the next page maintain that vice is advantageous to the public and indeed it seems upon any system of morality little less than a contradiction in terms to talk of a vice which is in general beneficial to societye thought this reasoning necessary in order to give some light to a philosophical question which has been much disputed in england call it a philosophical question not a political one for whatever may be the consequence of such a miraculous transformation of mankind as would endow them with every species of virtue and free them from every species of vice this concerns not the magistrate who aims only at possibilities he cannot cure every vice by substituting a virtue in its place very often he can only cure one vice by another and in that case he ought to prefer what is least pernicious to society luxury when excessive is the source of many ills but is in general preferable to sloth and idleness which would commonly succeed in its place and are more hurtful both to private persons and to the public when sloth reigns a mean uncultivated way of life prevails amongst individuals without society without enjoyment and if the sovereign in such a situation demands the service of his subjects the labour of the state suffices only to furnish the necessaries of life to the labourers and can afford nothing to those who are employed in the public service essay of money money is not properly speaking one of the subjects of commerce but only the instrument which men have agreed upon to facilitate the exchange of one commodity for another it is none of the wheels of trade it is the oil which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy if we consider any one kingdom by itself it is evident that the greater or less plenty of money is of no consequence since the prices of commodities are always proportioned to the plenty of money and a crown in harry viis time served the same purpose as a pound does at present it is only the public which draws any advantage from the greater plenty of money and that only in its wars and negociations with foreign states and this is the reason why all rich and trading countries from carthage to great britain and holland have employed mercenary troops which they hired from their poorer neighbours were they to make use of their native subjects they would find less advantage from their superior riches and from their great plenty of gold and silver since the pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public opulence our small army of men is maintained at as great expence as a french army a twice as numerous the english fleet during the late war required as much money to support it as all the roman legions which kept the whole world in subjection during the time of the emperors the greater number of people and their greater industry are serviceable in all cases at home and abroad in private and in public but the greater plenty of money is very limited in its use and may even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its commerce with foreigners there seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human affairs which checks the growth of trade and riches and hinders them from being confined entirely to one people as might naturally at first be dreaded from the advantages of an established commerce where one nation has gotten the start of another in trade it is very difficult for the latter to regain the ground it has lost because of the superior industry and skill of the former and the greater stocks of which its merchants are possessed and which enable them to trade on so much smaller profits but these advantages are compensated in some measure by the low price of labour in every nation which has not an extensive commerce and does not much abound in gold and silver manufactures therefore gradually shift their places leaving those countries and provinces which they have already enriched and flying to others whither they are allured by the cheapness of provisions and labour till they have enriched these also and are again banished by the same causes and in general we may observe that the dearness of every thing from plenty of money is a disadvantage which attends an established commerce and sets bounds to it in every country by enabling the poorer states to undersel the richer in all foreign markets this has made me entertain a doubt concerning the benefit of banks and papercredit which are so generally esteemed advantageous to every nation that provisions and labour should become dear by the encrease of trade and money is in many respects an inconvenience but an inconvenience that is unavoidable and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity which are the end of all our wishes it is compensated by the advantages which we reap from the possession of these precious metals and the weight which they give the nation in all foreign wars and negociations but there appears no reason for encreasing that inconvenience by a counterfeit money which foreigners will not accept of in any payment and which any great disorder in the state will reduce to nothing there are it is true many people in every rich state who having large sums of money would prefer paper with good security as being of more easy transport and more safe custody if the public provide not a bank private bankers will take advantage of this circumstance as the goldsmiths formerly did in london or as the bankers do at present in dublin and therefore it is better it may be thought that a public company should enjoy the benefit of that papercredit which always will have place in every opulent kingdom but to endeavour artificially to encrease such a credit can never be the interest of any trading nation but must lay them under disadvantages by encreasing money beyond its natural proportion to labour and commodities and thereby heightening their price to the merchant and manufacturer and in this view it must be allowed that no bank could be more advantageous than such a one as locked up all the money it received and never augmented the circulating coin as is usual by returning part of its treasure into commerce a public bank by this expedient might cut off much of the dealings of private bankers and moneyjobbers and though the state bore the charge of salaries to the directors and tellers of this bank for according to the preceding supposition it would have no profit from its dealings the national advantage resulting from the low price of labour and the destruction of papercredit would be a sufficient compensation not to mention that so large a sum lying ready at command would be a convenience in times of great public danger and distress and what part of it was used might be replaced at leisure when peace and tranquillity was restored to the nation but of this subject of paper credit we shall treat more largely hereafter and shall finish this essay on money by proposing and explaining two observations which may perhaps serve to employ the thoughts of our speculative politiciansc it was a shrewd observation of anacharsis the scythian who had never seen money in his own country that gold and silver seemed to him of no use to the greeks but to assist them in numeration and arithmetic it is indeed evident that money is nothing but the representation of labour and commodities and serves only as a method of rating or estimating them where coin is in greater plenty as a greater quantity of it is required to represent the same quantity of goods it can have no effect either good or bad taking a nation within itself any more than it would make an alteration on a merchants books if instead of the arabian method of notation which requires few characters he should make use of the roman which requires a great many nay the greater quantity of money like the roman characters is rather inconvenient and requires greater trouble both to keep and transport it but notwithstanding this conclusion which must be allowed just it is certain that since the discovery of the mines in america industry has encreased in all the nations of europe except in the possessors of those mines and this may justly be ascribed amongst other reasons to the encrease of gold and silver accordingly we find that in every kingdom into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly every thing takes a new face labour and industry gain life the merchant becomes more enterprising the manufacturer more diligent and skilful and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention this is not easily to be accounted for if we consider only the influence which a greater abundance of coin has in the kingdom itself by heightening the price of commodities and obliging every one to pay a greater number of these little yellow or white pieces for every thing he purchases and as to foreign trade it appears that great plenty of money is rather disadvantageous by raising the price of every kind of labour to account then for this phenomenon we must consider that though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the encrease of gold and silver yet it follows not immediately upon that encrease but some time is required before the money circulates through the whole state and makes its effect be felt on all ranks of people at first no alteration is perceived by degrees the price rises first of one commodity then of another till the whole at last reaches a just proportion with the new quantity of specie which is in the kingdom in my opinion it is only in this interval or intermediate situation between the acquisition of money and rise of prices that the encreasing quantity of gold and silver is favourable to industry when any quantity of money is imported into a nation it is not at first dispersed into many hands but is confined to the coffers of a few persons who immediately seek to employ it to advantage here are a set of manufacturers or merchants we shall suppose who have received returns of gold and silver for goods which they sent to cadiz they are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly who never dream of demanding higher wages but are glad of employment from such good paymasters if workmen become scarce the manufacturer gives higher wages but at first requires an encrease of labour and this is willingly submitted to by the artisan who can now eat and drink better to compensate his additional toil and fatigue he carries his money to market where he finds every thing at the same price as formerly but returns with greater quantity and of better kinds for the use of his family the farmer and gardener finding that all their commodities are taken off apply themselves with alacrity to the raising more and at the same time can afford to take better and more cloths from their tradesmen whose price is the same as formerly and their industry only whetted by so much new gain it is easy to trace the money in its progress through the whole commonwealth where we shall find that it must first quicken the diligence of every individual before it encrease the price of labour and that the specie may encrease to a considerable pitch before it have this latter effect appears amongst other instances from the frequent operations of the french king on the money where it was always found that the augmenting of the numerary value did not produce a proportional rise of the prices at least for some time in the last year of louis money was raised threesevenths but prices augmented only one corn in france is now sold at the same price or for the same number of livres it was in though silver was then at livres the mark and is now at not to mention the great addition of gold and silver which may have come into that kingdom since the former period from the whole of this reasoning we may conclude that it is of no manner of consequence with regard to the domestic happiness of a state whether money be in a greater or less quantity the good policy of the magistrate consists only in keeping it if possible still encreasing because by that means he keeps alive a spirit of industry in the nation and encreases the stock of labour in which consists all real power and riches a nation whose money decreases is actually at that time weaker and more miserable than another nation which possesses no more money but is on the encreasing hand this will be easily accounted for if we consider that the alterations in the quantity of money either on one side or the other are not immediately attended with proportionable alterations in the price of commodities there is always an interval before matters be adjusted to their new situation and this interval is as pernicious to industry when gold and silver are diminishing as it is advantageous when these metals are encreasing the workman has not the same employment from the manufacturer and merchant though he pays the same price for every thing in the market the farmer cannot dispose of his corn and cattle though he must pay the same rent to his landlord the poverty and beggary and sloth which must ensue are easily foreseen the second observation which proposed to make with regard to money may be explained after the following manner there are some kingdoms and many provinces in europe and all of them were once in the same condition where money is so scarce that the landlord can get none at all from his tenants but is obliged to take his rent in kind and either to consume it himself or transport it to places where he may find a market in those countries the prince can levy few or no taxes but in the same manner and as he will receive small benefit from impositions so paid it is evident that such a kingdom has little force even at home and cannot maintain fleets and armies to the same extent as if every part of it abounded in gold and silver there is surely a greater disproportion between the force of germany at present and what it was three centuries ago than there is in its industry people and manufactures the austrian dominions in the empire are in general well peopled and well cultivated and are of great extent but have not a proportionable weight in the balance of europe proceeding as is commonly supposed from the scarcity of money how do all these facts agree with that principle of reason that the quantity of gold and silver is in itself altogether indifferent according to that principle wherever a sovereign has numbers of subjects and these have plenty of commodities he should of course be great and powerful and they rich and happy independent of the greater or lesser abundance of the precious metals these admit of divisions and subdivisions to a great extent and where the pieces might become so small as to be in danger of being lost it is easy to mix the gold or silver with a baser metal as is practised in some countries of europe and by that means raise the pieces to a bulk more sensible and convenient they still serve the same purposes of exchange whatever their number may be or whatever colour they may be supposed to have to these difficulties answer that the effect here supposed to flow from scarcity of money really arises from the manners and customs of the people and that we mistake as is too usual a collateral effect for a cause the contradiction is only apparent but it requires some thought and reflection to discover the principles by which we can reconcile reason to experience it seems a maxim almost selfevident that the prices of every thing depend on the proportion between commodities and money and that any considerable alteration on either has the same effect either of heightening or lowering the price encrease the commodities they become cheaper encrease the money they rise in their value as on the other hand a diminution of the former and that of the latter have contrary tendencies it is also evident that the prices do not so much depend on the absolute quantity of commodities and that of money which are in a nation as on that of the commodities which come or may come to market and of the money which circulates if the coin be locked up in chests it is the same thing with regard to prices as if it were annihilated if the commodities be hoarded in e magazines and granaries a like effect follows as the money and commodities in these cases never meet they cannot affect each other were we at any time to form conjectures concerning the price of provisions the corn which the farmer must reserve f for seed and for the maintenance of himself and family ought never to enter into the estimation it is only the overplus compared to the demand that determines the value to apply these principles we must consider that in the first and more uncultivated ages of any state ere fancy has confounded her wants with those of nature men content with the produce of their own fields or with those rude improvements which they themselves can work upon them have little occasion for exchange at least for money which by agreement is the common measure of exchange the wool of the farmers own flock spun in his own family and wrought by a neighbouring weaver who receives his payment in corn or wool suffices for furniture and cloathing the carpenter the smith the mason the tailor are retained by wages of a like nature and the landlord himself dwelling in the neighbourhood is content to receive his rent in the commodities raised by the farmer the greater part of these he consumes at home in rustic hospitality the rest perhaps he disposes of for money to the neighbouring town whence he draws the few materials of his expence and luxury but after men begin to refine on all these enjoyments and live not always at home nor are content with what can be raised in their neighbourhood there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds and more money enters into that exchange the tradesmen will not be paid in corn because they want something more than barely to eat the farmer goes beyond his own parish for the commodities he purchases and cannot always carry his commodities to the merchant who supplies him the landlord lives in the capital or in a foreign country and demands his rent in gold and silver which can easily be transported to him great undertakers and manufacturers and merchants arise in every commodity and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie and consequently in this situation of society the coin enters into many more contracts and by that means is much more employed than in the former the necessary effect is that provided the money encrease not in the nation every thing must become much cheaper in times of industry and refinement than in rude uncultivated ages it is the proportion between the circulating money and the commodities in the market which determines the prices goods that are consumed at home or exchanged with other goods in the neighbourhood never come to market they affect not in the least the current specie with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated and consequently this method of using them sinks the proportion on the side of the commodities and encreases the prices but after money enters into all contracts and sales and is every where the measure of exchange the same national cash has a much greater task to perform all commodities are then in the market the sphere of circulation is enlarged it is the same case as if that individual sum were to serve a larger kingdom and therefore the proportion being here lessened on the side of the money every thing must become cheaper and the prices gradually fall by the most exact computations that have been formed all over europe after making allowance for the alteration in the numerary value or the denomination it is found that the prices of all things have only risen three or at most four times since the discovery of the west indies but will any one assert that there is not much more than four times the coin in europe that was in the fifteenth century and the centuries preceding it the spaniards and portuguese from their mines the english french and dutch by their african trade and by their interlopers in the west indies bring home about g six millions a year of which not above a third goes to the eastindies this sum alone in ten years would probably double the ancient stock of money in europe and no other satisfactory reason can be given why all prices have not risen to a much more exorbitant height except that which is derived from a change of customs and manners besides that more commodities are produced by additional industry the same commodities come more to market after men depart from their ancient simplicity of manners and though this encrease has not been equal to that of money it has however been considerable and has preserved the proportion between coin and commodities nearer the ancient standard were the question proposed which of these methods of living in the people the simple or refined is the most advantageous to the state or public should without much scruple prefer the latter in a view to politics at least and should produce this as an additional reason for the encouragement of trade and manufactures while men live in the ancient simple manner and supply all their necessaries from domestic industry or from the neighbourhood the sovereign can levy no taxes in money from a considerable part of his subjects and if he will impose on them any burthens he must take payment in commodities with which alone they abound a method attended with such great and obvious inconveniencies that they need not here be insisted on all the money he can pretend to raise must be from his principal cities where alone it circulates and these it is evident cannot afford him so much as the whole state could did gold and silver circulate throughout the whole but besides this obvious diminution of the revenue there is another cause of the poverty of the public in such a situation not only the sovereign receives less money but the same money goes not so far as in times of industry and general commerce every thing is dearer where the gold and silver are supposed equal and that because fewer commodities come to market and the whole coin bears a higher proportion to what is to be purchased by it whence alone the prices of every thing are fixed and determined here then we may learn the fallacy of the remark often to be met with in historians and even in common conversation that any particular state is weak though fertile populous and well cultivated merely because it wants money it appears that the want of money can never injure any state within itself for men and commodities are the real strength of any community it is the simple manner of living which here hurts the public by confining the gold and silver to few hands and preventing its universal diffusion and circulation on the contrary industry and refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole state however small its quantity may be they digest it into every vein so to speak and make it enter into every transaction and contract no hand is entirely empty of it and as the prices of every thing fall by that means the sovereign has a double advantage he may draw money by his taxes from every part of the state and what he receives goes farther in every purchase and payment we may infer from a comparison of prices that money is not more plentiful in china than it was in europe three centuries ago but what immense power is that empire possessed of if we may judge by the civil and military establishment maintained by it polybius tells us that provisions were so cheap in italy during his time that in some places theh stated price for a meal at the inns was a semis a head little more than a farthing yet the roman power had even then subdued the whole known world about a century before that period the carthaginian ambassador said by way of raillery that no people lived more sociably amongst themselves than the romans for that in every entertainment which as foreign ministers they received they still observed the same plate at every table the absolute quantity of the precious metals is a matter of great indifference there are only two circumstances of any importance namely their gradual encrease and their thorough concoction and circulation through the state and the influence of both these circumstances has here been explained in the following essay we shall see an instance of a like fallacy as that above mentioned where a collateral effect is taken for a cause and where a consequence is ascribed to the plenty of money though it be really owing to a change in the manners and customs of the people essay of interest nothing is esteemed a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than the lowness of interest and with reason though believe the cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended lowness of interest is generally ascribed to plenty of money but money however plentiful has no other effect if fixed than to raise the price of labour silver is more common than gold and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same commodities but do you pay less interest for it interest in batavia and jamaica is at per cent in portugal at though these places as we may learn from the prices of every thing abound more in gold and silver than either london or amsterdam were all the gold in england annihilated at once and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea would money be more plentiful or interest lower no surely we should only use silver instead of gold were gold rendered as common as silver and silver as common as copper would money be more plentiful or interest lower we may assuredly give the same answer our shillings would then be yellow and our halfpence white and we should have no guineas no other difference would ever be observed no alteration on commerce manufactures navigation or interest unless we imagine that the colour of the metal is of any consequence now what is so visible in these greater variations of scarcity or abundance in the precious metals must hold in all inferior changes if the multiplying of gold and silver fifteen times makes no difference much less can the doubling or tripling them all augmentation has no other effect than to heighten the price of labour and commodities and even this variation is little more than that of a name in the progress towards these changes the augmentation may have some influence by exciting industry but after the prices are settled suitably to the new abundance of gold and silver it has no manner of influence an effect always holds proportion with its cause prices have risen near four times since the discovery of the indies and it is probable gold and silver have multiplied much more but interest has not fallen much above half the rate of interest therefore is not derived from the quantity of the precious metals money having chiefly a fictitious valuea the greater or less plenty of it is of no consequence if we consider a nation within itself and the quantity of specie when once fixed though ever so large has no other effect than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of those shining bits of metal for clothes furniture or equipage without encreasing any one convenience of life if a man borrow money to build a house he then carries home a greater load because the stone timber lead glass c with the labour of the masons and carpenters are represented by a greater quantity of gold and silver but as these metals are considered chiefly as representations there can no alteration arise from their bulk or quantity their weight or colour either upon their real value or their interest the same interest in all cases bears the same proportion to the sum and if you lent me so much labour and so many commodities by receiving five per cent you always receive proportional labour and commodities however represented whether by yellow or white coin whether by a pound or an ounce it is in vain therefore to look for the cause of the fall or rise of interest in the greater or less quantity of gold and silver which is fixed in any nation high interest arises from three circumstances a great demand for borrowing little riches to supply that demand and great profits arising from commerce and these circumstances are a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry not of the scarcity of gold and silver low interest on the other hand proceeds from the three opposite circumstances a small demand for borrowing great riches to supply that demand and small profits arising from commerce and these circumstances are all connected together and proceed from the encrease of industry and commerce not of gold and silver we shall endeavour to prove these points and shall begin with the causes and the effects of a great or small demand for borrowing when a people have emerged ever so little from a savage state and their numbers have encreased beyond the original multitude there must immediately arise an inequality of property and while some possess large tracts of land others are confined within narrow limits and some are entirely without any landed property those who possess more land than they can labour employ those who possess none and agree to receive a determinate part of the product thus the landed interest is immediately established nor is there any settled government however rude in which affairs are not on this footing of these proprietors of land some must presently discover themselves to be of different tempers from others and while one would willingly store up the produce of his land for futurity another desires to consume at present what should suffice for many years but as the spending of a settled revenue is a way of life entirely without occupation men have so much need of somewhat to fix and engage them that pleasures such as they are will be the pursuit of the greater part of the landholders and the prodigals among them will always be more numerous than the misers in a state therefore where there is nothing but a landed interest as there is little frugality the borrowers must be very numerous and the rate of interest must hold proportion to it the difference depends not on the quantity of money but on the habits and manners which prevail by this alone the demand for borrowing is encreased or diminished were money so plentiful as to make an egg be sold for sixpence so long as there are only landed gentry and peasants in the state the borrowers must be numerous and interest high the rent for the same farm would be heavier and more bulky but the same idleness of the landlord with the higher price of commodities would dissipate it in the same time and produce the same necessity and demand for borrowingb nor is the case different with regard to the second circumstance which we proposed to consider namely the great or little riches to supply the demand this effect also depends on the habits and way of living of the people not on the quantity of gold and silver in order to have in any state a great number of lenders it is not sufficient nor requisite that there be great abundance of the precious metals it is only requisite that the property or command of that quantity which is in the state whether great or small should be collected in particular hands so as to form considerable sums or compose a great monied interest this begets a number of lenders and sinks the rate of usury and this shall venture to affirm depends not on the quantity of specie but on particular manners and customs which make the specie gather into separate sums or masses of considerable value for suppose that by miracle every man in great britain should have five pounds slipt into his pocket in one night this would much more than double the whole money that is at present in the kingdom yet there would not next day nor for some time be any more lenders nor any variation in the interest and were there nothing but landlords and peasants in the state this money however abundant could never gather into sums and would only serve to encrease the prices of every thing without any farther consequence the prodigal landlord dissipates it as fast as he receives it and the beggarly peasant has no means nor view nor ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood the overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continuing still the same there will follow no reduction of interest that depends upon another principle and must proceed from an encrease of industry and frugality of arts and commerce every thing useful to the life of man arises from the ground but few things arise in that condition which is requisite to render them useful there must therefore beside the peasants and the proprietors of land be another rank of men who receiving from the former the rude materials work them into their proper form and retain part for their own use and subsistence in the infancy of society these contracts between the artisans and the peasants and between one species of artisans and another are commonly entered into immediately by the persons themselves who being neighbours are easily acquainted with each others necessities and can lend their mutual assistance to supply them but when mens industry encreases and their views enlarge it is found that the most remote parts of the state can assist each other as well as the more contiguous and that this intercourse of good offices may be carried on to the greatest extent and intricacy hence the origin of merchants one of the most useful races of men who serve as agents between those parts of the state that are wholly unacquainted and are ignorant of each others necessities here are in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen and a thousand customers and these two ranks of men so necessary to each other can never rightly meet till one man erects a shop to which all the workmen and all the customers repair in this province grass rises in abundance the inhabitants abound in cheese and butter and cattle but want bread and corn which in a neighbouring province are in too great abundance for the use of the inhabitants one man discovers this he brings corn from the one province and returns with cattle and supplying the wants of both he is so far a common benefactor as the people encrease in numbers and industry the difficulty of their intercourse encreases the business of the agency or merchandize becomes more intricate and divides subdivides compounds and mixes to a greater variety in all these transactions it is necessary and reasonable that a considerable part of the commodities and labour should belong to the merchant to whom in a great measure they are owing and these commodities he will sometimes preserve in kind or more commonly convert into money which is their common representation if gold and silver have encreased in the state together with the industry it will require a great quantity of these metals to represent a great quantity of commodities and labour if industry alone has encreased the prices of every thing must sink and a small quantity of specie will serve as a representation there is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for exercise and employment and this desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits deprive a man of all business and serious occupation he runs restless from one amusement to another and the weight and oppression which he feels from idleness is so great that he forgets the ruin which must follow him from his immoderate expences give him a more harmless way of employing his mind or body he is satisfied and feels no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure but if the employment you give him be lucrative especially if the profit be attached to every particular exertion of industry he has gain so often in his eye that he acquires by degrees a passion for it and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing the daily encrease of his fortune and this is the reason why trade encreases frugality and why among merchants there is the same overplus of misers above prodigals as among the possessors of land there is the contrary commerce encreases industry by conveying it readily from one member of the state to another and allowing none of it to perish or become useless it encreases frugality by giving occupation to men and employing them in the arts of gain which soon engage their affection and remove all relish for pleasure and expence it is an infallible consequence of all industrious professions to beget frugality and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure among lawyers and physicians who have any practice there are many more who live within their income than who exceed it or even live up to it but lawyers and physicians beget no industry and it is even at the expence of others they acquire their riches so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fellowcitizens as fast as they encrease their own merchants on the contrary beget industry by serving as canals to convey it through every corner of the state and at the same time by their frugality they acquire great power over that industry and collect a large property in the labour and commodities which they are the chief instruments in producing there is no other profession therefore except merchandize which can make the monied interest considerable or in other words can encrease industry and by also encreasing frugality give a great command of that industry to particular members of the society without commerce the state must consist chiefly of landed gentry whose prodigality and expence make a continual demand for borrowing and of peasants who have no sums to supply that demand the money never gathers into large stocks or sums which can be lent at interest it is dispersed into numberless hands who either squander it in idle show and magnificence or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life commerce alone assembles it into considerable sums and this effect it has merely from the industry which it begets and the frugality which it inspires independent of that particular quantity of precious metal which may circulate in the state thus an encrease of commerce by a necessary consequence raises a great number of lenders and by that means produces lowness of interest we must now consider how far this encrease of commerce diminishes the profits arising from that profession and gives rise to the third circumstance requisite to produce lowness of interest it may be proper to observe on this head that low interest and low profits of merchandize are two events that mutually forward each other and are both originally derived from that extensive commerce which produces opulent merchants and renders the monied interest considerable where merchants possess great stocks whether represented by few or many pieces of metal it must frequently happen that when they either become tired of business or leave heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce a great proportion of these riches naturally seeks an annual and secure revenue the plenty diminishes the price and makes the lenders accept of a low interest this consideration obliges many to keep their stock employed in trade and rather be content with low profits than dispose of their money at an undervalue on the other hand when commerce has become extensive and employs large stocks there must arise rivalships among the merchants which diminish the profits of trade at the same time that they encrease the trade itself the low profits of merchandize induce the merchants to accept more willingly of a low interest when they leave off business and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence it is needless therefore to enquire which of these circumstances to wit low interest or low profits is the cause and which the effect they both arise from an extensive commerce and mutually forward each other no man will accept of low profits where he can have high interest and no man will accept of low interest where he can have high profits an extensive commerce by producing large stocks diminishes both interest and profits and is always assisted in its diminution of the one by the proportional sinking of the other may add that as low profits arise from the encrease of commerce and industry they serve in their turn to its farther encrease by rendering the commodities cheaper encouraging the consumption and heightening the industry and thus if we consider the whole connexion of causes and effects interest is the barometer of the state and its lowness is a sign almost infallible of the flourishing condition of a people it proves the encrease of industry and its prompt circulation through the whole state little inferior to a demonstration and though perhaps it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind by throwing so many stocks out of trade it must be attended with such misery and want of employment in the poor that besides its short duration it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other those who have asserted that the plenty of money was the cause of low interest seem to have taken a collateral effect for a cause since the same industry which sinks the interest commonly acquires great abundance of the precious metals a variety of fine manufactures with vigilant enterprising merchants will soon draw money to a state if it be any where to be found in the world the same cause by multiplying the conveniencies of life and encreasing industry collects great riches into the hands of persons who are not proprietors of land and produces by that means a lowness of interest but though both these effects plenty of money and low interest naturally arise from commerce and industry they are altogether independent of each other for suppose a nation removed into the pacific ocean without any foreign commerce or any knowledge of navigation suppose that this nation possesses always the same stock of coin but is continually encreasing in its numbers and industry it is evident that the price of every commodity must gradually diminish in that kingdom since it is the proportion between money and any species of goods which fixes their mutual value and upon the present supposition the conveniencies of life become every day more abundant without any alteration in the current specie a less quantity of money therefore among this people will make a rich man during the times of industry than would suffice to that purpose in ignorant and slothful ages less money will build a house portion a daughter buy an estate support a manufactory or maintain a family and equipage these are the uses for which men borrow money and therefore the greater or less quantity of it in a state has no influence on the interest but it is evident that the greater or less stock of labour and commodities must have a great influence since we really and in effect borrow these when we take money upon interest it is true when commerce is extended all over the globe the most industrious nations always abound most with the precious metals so that low interest and plenty of money are in fact almost inseparable but still it is of consequence to know the principle whence any phenomenon arises and to distinguish between a cause and a concomitant effect besides that the speculation is curious it may frequently be of use in the conduct of public affairs at least it must be owned that nothing can be of more use than to improve by practice the method of reasoning on these subjects which of all others are the most important though they are commonly treated in the loosest and most careless manner another reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause of low interest seems to be the instance of some nations where after a sudden acquisition of money or of the precious metals by means of foreign conquest the interest has fallen not only among them but in all the neighbouring states as soon as that money was dispersed and had insinuated itself into every corner thus interest in spain fell near a half immediately after the discovery of the west indies as we are informed by garcilasso de la vega and it has been ever since gradually sinking in every kingdom of europe interest in rome after the conquest of egypt fell from to per cent as we learn from dion the causes of the sinking of interest upon such an event seem different in the conquering country and in the neighbouring states but in neither of them can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the encrease of gold and silver in the conquering country it is natural to imagine that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few hands and be gathered into large sums which seek a secure revenue either by the purchase of land or by interest and consequently the same effect follows for a little time as if there had been a great accession of industry and commerce the encrease of lenders above the borrowers sinks the interest and so much the faster if those who have acquired those large sums find no industry or commerce in the state and no method of employing their money but by lending it at interest but after this new mass of gold and silver has been digested and has circulated through the whole state affairs will soon return to their former situation while the landlords and new moneyholders living idly squander above their income and the former daily contract debt and the latter encroach on their stock till its final extinction the whole money may still be in the state and make itself felt by the encrease of prices but not being now collected into any large masses or stocks the disproportion between the borrowers and lenders is the same as formerly and consequently the high interest returns accordingly we find in rome that so early as tiberiuss time interest had again mounted to per cent though no accident had happened to drain the empire of money in trajans time money lent on mortgages in italy bore per cent on common securities in bithynia and if interest in spain has not risen to its old pitch this can be ascribed to nothing but the continuance of the same cause that sunk it to wit the large fortunes continually made in the indies which come over to spain from time to time and supply the demand of the borrowers by this accidental and extraneous cause more money is to be lent in spain that is more money is collected into large sums than would otherwise be found in a state where there are so little commerce and industry as to the reduction of interest which has followed in england france and other kingdoms of europe that have no mines it has been gradual and has not proceeded from the encrease of money considered merely in itself but from that of industry which is the natural effect of the former encrease in that interval before it raises the price of labour and provisions for to return to the foregoing supposition if the industry of england had risen as much from other causes and that rise might easily have happened though the stock of money had remained the same must not all the same consequences have followed which we observe at present the same people would in that case be found in the kingdom the same commodities the same industry manufactures and commerce and consequently the same merchants with the same stocks that is with the same command over labour and commodities only represented by a smaller number of white or yellow pieces which being a circumstance of no moment would only affect the waggoner porter and trunkmaker luxury therefore manufactures arts industry frugality flourishing equally as at present it is evident that interest must also have been as low since that is the necessary result of all these circumstances so far as they determine the profits of commerce and the proportion between the borrowers and lenders in any state essay of the balance of trade it is very usual in nations ignorant of the nature of commerce to prohibit the exportation of commodities and to preserve among themselves whatever they think valuable and useful they do not consider that in this prohibition they act directly contrary to their intention and that the more is exported of any commodity the more will be raised at home of which they themselves will always have the first offer it is well known to the learned that the ancient laws of athens rendered the exportation of figs criminal that being supposed a species of fruit so excellent in attica that the athenians deemed it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner and in this ridiculous prohibition they were so much in earnest that informers were thence called sycophants among them from two greek words which signify figs and discoverer a there are proofs in many old acts of parliament of the same ignorance in the nature of commerce particularly in the reign of edward and to this day in france the exportation of corn is almost always prohibited in order as they say to prevent famines though it is evident that nothing contributes more to the frequent famines which so much distress that fertile country the same jealous fear with regard to money has also prevailed among several nations and it required both reason and experience to convince any people that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the exchange against them and produce a still greater exportation these errors one may say are gross and palpable but there still prevails even in nations well acquainted with commerce a strong jealousy with regard to the balance of trade and a fear that all their gold and silver may be leaving them this seems to me almost in every case a groundless apprehension and should as soon dread that all our springs and rivers should be exhausted as that money should abandon a kingdom where there are people and industry let us carefully preserve these latter advantages and we need never be apprehensive of losing the former it is easy to observe that all calculations concerning the balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and suppositions the customhouse books are allowed to be an insufficient ground of reasoning nor is the rate of exchange much better unless we consider it with all nations and know also the proportions of the several sums remitted which one may safely pronounce impossible every man who has ever reasoned on this subject has always proved his theory whatever it was by facts and calculations and by an enumeration of all the commodities sent to all foreign kingdoms the writings of mr gee struck the nation with an universal panic when they saw it plainly demonstrated by a detail of particulars that the balance was against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six years but luckily twenty years have since elapsed with an expensive foreign war yet is it commonly supposed that money is still more plentiful among us than in any former period nothing can be more entertaining on this head than dr swift an authorb so quick in discerning the mistakes and absurdities of others he says in his short view of the state ofireland that the whole cash of that kingdom formerly amounted but to l that out of this the irish remitted every year a neat million to england and had scarcely any other source from which they could compensate themselves and little other foreign trade than the importation of french wines for which they paid ready money the consequence of this situation which must be owned to be disadvantageous was that in a course of three years the current money of ireland from l was reduced to less than two and at present suppose in a course of years it is absolutely nothing yet know not how that opinion of the advance of riches in ireland which gave the doctor so much indignation seems still to continue and gain ground with every body in short this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade appears of such a nature that it discovers itself wherever one is out of humour with the ministry or is in low spirits and as it can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports which counterbalance the imports it may here be proper to form a general argument that may prove the impossibility of this event as long as we preserve our people and our industry suppose fourfifths of all the money in great britain to be annihilated in one night and the nation reduced to the same condition with regard to specie as in the reigns of the harrys and edwards what would be the consequence must not the price of all labour and commodities sink in proportion and every thing be sold as cheap as they were in those ages what nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market or pretend to navigate or to sell manufactures at the same price which to us would afford sufficient profit in how little time therefore must this bring back the money which we had lost and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations where after we have arrived we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and commodities and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our fulness and repletion again suppose that all the money of great britain were multiplied fivefold in a night must not the contrary effect follow must not all labour and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height that no neighbouring nations could afford to buy from us while their commodities on the other hand became comparatively so cheap that in spite of all the laws which could be formed they would be run in upon us and our money flow out till we fall to a level with foreigners and lose that great superiority of riches which had laid us under such disadvantages now it is evident that the same causes which would correct these exorbitant inequalities were they to happen miraculously must prevent their happening in the common course of nature and must for ever in all neighbouring nations preserve money nearly proportionable to the art and industry of each nation all water wherever it communicates remains always at a level ask naturalists the reason they tell you that were it to be raised in any one place the superior gravity of that part not being balanced must depress it till it meet a counterpoise and that the same cause which redresses the inequality when it happens must for ever prevent it without some violent external operation can one imagine that it had ever been possible by any laws or even by any art or industry to have kept all the money in spain which the galleons have brought from the indies or that all commodities could be sold in france for a tenth of the price which they would yield on the other side of the pyrenees without finding their way thither and draining from that immense treasure what other reason indeed is there why all nations at present gain in their trade with spain and portugal but because it is impossible to heap up money more than any fluid beyond its proper level the sovereigns of these countries have shown that they wanted not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves had it been in any degree practicable but as any body of water may be raised above the level of the surrounding element if the former has no communication with the latter so in money if the communication be cut off by any material or physical impediment for all laws alone are ineffectual there may in such a case be a very great inequality of money thus the immense distance of china together with the monopolies of our india companies obstructing the communication preserve in europe the gold and silver especially the latter in much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom but notwithstanding this great obstruction the force of the causes abovementioned is still evident the skill and ingenuity of europe in general surpasses perhaps that of china with regard to manual arts and manufactures yet are we never able to trade thither without great disadvantage and were it not for the continual recruits which we receive from america money would soon sink in europe and rise in china till it came nearly to a level in both places nor can any reasonable man doubt but that industrious nation were they as near us as poland or barbary would drain us of the overplus of our specie and draw to themselves a larger share of the west indian treasures we need not have recourse to a physical attraction in order to explain the necessity of this operation there is a moral attraction arising from the interests and passions of men which is full as potent and infallible how is the balance kept in the provinces of every kingdom among themselves but by the force of this principle which makes it impossible for money to lose its level and either to rise or sink beyond the proportion of the labour and commodities which are in each province did not long experience make people easy on this head what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford to a melancholy yorkshireman while he computed and magnified the sums drawn to london by taxes absentees commodities and found on comparison the opposite articles so much inferior and no doubt had the heptarchy subsisted in england the legislature of each state had been continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong balance and as it is probable that the mutual hatred of these states would have been extremely violent on account of their close neighbourhood they would have loaded and oppressed all commerce by a jealous and superfluous caution since the union has removed the barriers between scotland and england which of these nations gains from the other by this free commerce or if the former kingdom has received any encrease of riches can it reasonably be accounted for by any thing but the encrease of its art and industry it was a common apprehension in england before the union as we learn from labbe du bos that scotland would soon drain them of their treasure were an open trade allowed and on the other side the tweed a contrary apprehension prevailed with what justice in both time has shown what happens in small portions of mankind must take place in greater the provinces of the roman empire no doubt kept their balance with each other and with italy independent of the legislature as much as the several counties of great britain or the several parishes of each county and any man who travels over europe at this day may see by the prices of commodities that money in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states has brought itself nearly to a level and that the difference between one kingdom and another is not greater in this respect than it is often between different provinces of the same kingdom men naturally flock to capital cities seaports and navigable rivers there we find more men more industry more commodities and consequently more money but still the latter difference holds proportion with the former and the level is preserved our jealousy and our hatred of france are without bounds and the former sentiment at least must be acknowledged reasonable and wellgrounded these passions have occasioned innumerable barriers and obstructions upon commerce where we are accused of being commonly the aggressors but what have we gained by the bargain we lost the french market for our woollen manufactures and transferred the commerce of wine to spain and portugal where we buy worse liquor at a higher price there are few englishmen who would not think their country absolutely ruined were french wines sold in england so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant in some measure all ale and homebrewed liquors but would we lay aside prejudice it would not be difficult to prove that nothing could be more innocent perhaps advantageous each new acre of vineyard planted in france in order to supply england with wine would make it requisite for the french to take the produce of an english acre sown in wheat or barley in order to subsist themselves and it is evident that we should thereby get command of the better commodity there are many edicts of the french king prohibiting the planting of new vineyards and ordering all those which are lately planted to be grubbed up so sensible are they in that country of the superior value of corn above every other product mareschal vauban complains often and with reason of the absurd duties which load the entry of those wines of languedoc guienne and other southern provinces that are imported into britanny and normandy he entertained no doubt but these latter provinces could preserve their balance notwithstanding the open commerce which he recommends and it is evident that a few leagues more navigation to england would make no difference or if it did that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms there is indeed one expedient by which it is possible to sink and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in any kingdom but these cases when examined will be found to resolve into our general theory and to bring additional authority to it scarcely know any method of sinking money below its level but those institutions of banks funds and papercredit c which are so much practised in this kingdom these render paper equivalent to money circulate it throughout the whole state make it supply the place of gold and silver raise proportionably the price of labour and commodities and by that means either banish a great part of those precious metals or prevent their farther encrease what can be more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head we fancy because an individual would be much richer were his stock of money doubled that the same good effect would follow were the money of every one encreased not considering that this would raise as much the price of every commodity and reduce every man in time to the same condition as before it is only in our public negociations and transactions with foreigners that a greater stock of money is advantageous and as our paper is there absolutely insignificant we feel by its means all the ill effects arising from a great abundance of money without reaping any of the advantages suppose that there are millions of paper which circulate in the kingdom as money for we are not to imagine that all our enormous funds are employed in that shape and suppose the real cash of the kingdom to be millions here is a state which is found by experience to be able to hold a stock of millions say if it be able to hold it it must of necessity have acquired it in gold and silver had we not obstructed the entrance of these metals by this new invention of paper whence would it have acquired that sum from all the kingdoms of the world but why because if you remove these millions money in this state is below its level compared with our neighbours and we must immediately draw from all of them till we be full and saturate so to speak and can hold no more by our present politics we are as careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bankbills and chequernotes as if we were afraid of being overburthened with the precious metals it is not to be doubted but the great plenty of bullion in france is in a great measure owing to the want of papercredit the french have no banks merchants bills do not there circulate as with us usury or lending on interest is not directly permitted so that many have large sums in their coffers great quantities of plate are used in private houses and all the churches are full of it by this means provisions and labour still remain cheaper among them than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and silver the advantages of this situation in point of trade as well as in great public emergencies are too evident to be disputed the same fashion a few years ago prevailed in genoa which still has place in england and holland of using services of chinaware instead of plate but the senate foreseeing the consequence prohibited the use of that brittle commodity beyond a certain extent while the use of silverplate was left unlimited and suppose in their late distresses they felt the good effect of this ordinance our tax on plate is perhaps in this view somewhat impolitic before the introduction of papermoney into our colonies they had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation since the introduction of that commodity the least inconveniency that has followed is the total banishment of the precious metals and after the abolition of paper can it be doubted but money will return while these colonies possess manufactures and commodities the only thing valuable in commerce and for whose sake alone all men desire money what pity lycurgus did not think of papercredit when he wanted to banish gold and silver from sparta it would have served his purpose better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money and would also have prevented more effectually all commerce with strangers as being of so much less real and intrinsic value d it must however be confessed that as all these questions of trade and money are extremely complicated there are certain lights in which this subject may be placed so as to represent the advantages of papercredit and banks to be superior to their disadvantages that they banish specie and bullion from a state is undoubtedly true and whoever looks no farther than this circumstance does well to condemn them but specie and bullion are not of so great consequence as not to admit of a compensation and even an overbalance from the encrease of industry and of credit which may be promoted by the right use of papermoney it is well known of what advantage it is to a merchant to be able to discount his bills upon occasion and every thing that facilitates this species of traffic is favourable to the general commerce of a state but private bankers are enabled to give such credit by the credit they receive from the depositing of money in their shops and the bank of england in the same manner from the liberty it has to issue its notes in all payments there was an invention of this kind which was fallen upon some years ago by the banks of edinburgh and which as it is one of the most ingenious ideas that has been executed in commerce has also been thought advantageous to scotland it is there called a bankcredit and is of this nature a man goes to the bank and finds surety to the amount we shall suppose of a thousand pounds this money or any part of it he has the liberty of drawing out whenever he pleases and he pays only the ordinary interest for it while it is in his hands he may when he pleases repay any sum so small as twenty pounds and the interest is discounted from the very day of the repayment the advantages resulting from this contrivance are manifold as a man may find surety nearly to the amount of his substance and his bankcredit is equivalent to ready money a merchant does hereby in a manner coin his houses his household furniture the goods in his warehouse the foreign debts due to him his ships at sea and can upon occasion employ them in all payments as if they were the current money of the country if a man borrow a thousand pounds from a private hand besides that it is not always to be found when required he pays interest for it whether he be using it or not his bankcredit costs him nothing except during the very moment in which it is of service to him and this circumstance is of equal advantage as if he had borrowed money at much lower interest merchants likewise from this invention acquire a great facility in supporting each others credit which is a considerable security against bankruptcies a man when his own bankcredit is exhausted goes to any of his neighbours who is not in the same condition and he gets the money which he replaces at his convenience e after this practice had taken place during some years at edinburgh several companies of merchants at glasgow carried the matter farther they associated themselves into different banks and issued notes so low as ten shillings which they used in all payments for goods manufactures tradesmens labour of all kinds and these notes from the established credit of the companies passed as money in all payments throughout the country by this means a stock of five thousand pounds was able to perform the same operations as if it were six or seven and merchants were thereby enabled to trade to a greater extent and to require less profit in all their transactions but whatever other advantages result from these inventions it must still be allowed that besides giving too great facility to credit which is dangerous they banish the precious metals and nothing can be a more evident proof of it than a comparison of the past and present condition of scotland in that particular it was found upon the recoinage made after the union that there was near a million of specie in that country but notwithstanding the great encrease of riches commerce and manufactures of all kinds it is thought that even where there is no extraordinary drain made by england the current specie will not now amount to a third of that sum f but as our projects of papercredit are almost the only expedient by which we can sink money below its level so in my opinion the only expedient by which we can raise money above it is a practice which we should all exclaim against as destructive namely the gathering of large sums into a public treasure locking them up and absolutely preventing their circulation the fluid not communicating with the neighbouring element may by such an artifice be raised to what height we please to prove this we need only return to our first supposition of annihilating the half or any part of our cash where we found that the immediate consequence of such an event would be the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms nor does there seem to be any necessary bounds set by the nature of things to this practice of hoarding a small city like geneva continuing this policy for ages might engross ninetenths of the money of europe there seems indeed in the nature of man an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches a weak state with an enormous treasure will soon become a prey to some of its poorer but more powerful neighbours a great state would dissipate its wealth in dangerous and illconcerted projects and probably destroy with it what is much more valuable the industry morals and numbers of its people the fluid in this case raised to too great a height bursts and destroys the vessel that contains it and mixing itself with the surrounding element soon falls to its proper level so little are we commonly acquainted with this principle that though all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an event as the immense treasure amassed by harry which they make amount to g pounds we rather reject their concurring testimony than admit of a fact which agrees so ill with our inveterate prejudices it is indeed probable that this sum might be threefourths of all the money in england but where is the difficulty in conceiving that such a sum might be amassed in twenty years by a cunning rapacious frugal and almost absolute monarch nor is it probable that the diminution of circulating money was ever sensibly felt by the people or ever did them any prejudice the sinking of the prices of all commodities would immediately replace it by giving england the advantage in its commerce with the neighbouring kingdoms have we not an instance in the small republic of athens with its allies who in about fifty years between the median and peloponnesian wars amassed h a sum not much inferior to that of harry for all the greek historians and orators agree that the athenians collected in the citadel more than talents which they afterwards dissipated to their own ruin in rash and imprudent enterprizes but when this money was set a running and began to communicate with the surrounding fluid what was the consequence did it remain in the state no for we find by the memorable census mentioned by demosthenes and polybius that in about fifty years afterwards the whole value of the republic comprehending lands houses commodities slaves and money was less than talents what an ambitious highspirited people was this to collect and keep in their treasury with a view to conquests a sum which it was every day in the power of the citizens by a single vote to distribute among themselves and which would have gone near to triple the riches of every individual for we must observe that the numbers and private riches of the athenians are said by ancient writers to have been no greater at the beginning of the peloponnesian war than at the beginning of the macedonian money was little more plentiful in greece during the age of philip and perseus than in england during that of harry yet these two monarchs in thirty years collected from the small kingdom of macedon a larger treasure than that of the english monarch paulus æmilius brought to rome about pounds sterlingpliny says and that was but a part of the macedonian treasure the rest was dissipated by the resistance and flight of perseus we may learn from stanian that the canton of berne had pounds lent at interest and had above six times as much in their treasury here then is a sum hoarded of pounds sterling which is at least quadruple what should naturally circulate in such a petty state and yet no one who travels in the pais de vaux or any part of that canton observes any want of money more than could be supposed in a country of that extent soil and situation on the contrary there are scarce any inland provinces in the continent of france or germany where the inhabitants are at this time so opulent though that canton has vastly encreased its treasure since the time when stanian wrote his judicious account of switzerland the account given by appian of the treasure of the ptolemies is so prodigious that one cannot admit of it and so much the less because the historian says that the other successors of alexander were also frugal and had many of them treasures not much inferior for this saving humour of the neighbouring princes must necessarily have checked the frugality of the egyptian monarchs according to the foregoing theory the sum he mentions is talents or pounds shillings and pence according to dr arbuthnots computation and yet appian says that he extracted his account from the public records and he was himself a native of alexandria from these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to form of those numberless bars obstructions and imposts which all nations of europe and none more than england have put upon trade from an exorbitant desire of amassing money which never will heap up beyond its level while it circulates or from an illgrounded apprehension of losing their specie which never will sink below it could any thing scatter our riches it would be such impolitic contrivances but this general ill effect however results from them that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free communication and exchange which the author of the world has intended by giving them soils climates and geniuses so different from each other our modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money the using of papercredit they reject the only method of amassing it the practice of hoarding and they adopt a hundred contrivances which serve to no purpose but to check industry and rob ourselves and our neighbours of the common benefits of art and nature all taxes however upon foreign commodities are not to be regarded as prejudicial or useless but those only which are founded on the jealousy abovementioned a tax on german linen encourages home manufactures and thereby multiplies our people and industry a tax on brandy encreases the sale of rum and supports our southern colonies and as it is necessary that imposts should be levied for the support of government it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities which can easily be intercepted at the port and subjected to the impost we ought however always to remember the maxim of dr swift that in the arithmetic of the customs two and two make not four but often make only one it can scarcely be doubted but if the duties on wine were lowered to a third they would yield much more to the government than at present our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more wholesome liquor and no prejudice would ensue to the balance of trade of which we are so jealous the manufacture of ale beyond the agriculture is but inconsiderable and gives employment to few hands the transport of wine and corn would not be much inferior but are there not frequent instances you will say of states and kingdoms which were formerly rich and opulent and are now poor and beggarly has not the money left them with which they formerly abounded answer if they lose their trade industry and people they cannot expect to keep their gold and silver for these precious metals will hold proportion to the former advantages when lisbon and amsterdam got the eastindia trade from venice and genoa they also got the profits and money which arose from it where the seat of government is transferred where expensive armies are maintained at a distance where great funds are possessed by foreigners there naturally follows from these causes a diminution of the specie but these we may observe are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money and are in time commonly attended with the transport of people and industry but where these remain and the drain is not continued the money always finds its way back again by a hundred canals of which we have no notion or suspicion what immense treasures have been spent by so many nations in flanders since the revolution in the course of three long wars more money perhaps than the half of what is at present in europe but what has now become of it is it in the narrow compass of the austrian provinces no surely it has most of it returned to the several countries whence it came and has followed that art and industry by which at first it was acquired i for above a thousand years the money of europe has been flowing to rome by an open and sensible current but it has been emptied by many secret and insensible canals and the want of industry and commerce renders at present the papal dominions the poorest territory in all italy in short a government has great reason to preserve with care its people and its manufactures its money it may safely trust to the course of human affairs without fear or jealousy or if it ever give attention to this latter circumstance it ought only to be so far as it affects the former essay of the jealousy of trade having endeavoured to remove one species of illfounded jealousy which is so prevalent among commercial nations it may not be amiss to mention another which seems equally groundless nothing is more usual among states which have made some advances in commerce than to look on the progress of their neighbours with a suspicious eye to consider all trading states as their rivals and to suppose that it is impossible for any of them to flourish but at their expence in opposition to this narrow and malignant opinion will venture to assert that the encrease of riches and commerce in any one nation instead of hurting commonly promotes the riches and commerce of all its neighbours and that a state can scarcely carry its trade and industry very far where all the surrounding states are buried in ignorance sloth and barbarism it is obvious that the domestic industry of a people cannot be hurt by the greatest prosperity of their neighbours and as this branch of commerce is undoubtedly the most important in any extensive kingdom we are so far removed from all reason of jealousy but go farther and observe that where an open communication is preserved among nations it is impossible but the domestic industry of every one must receive an encrease from the improvements of the others compare the situation of great britain at present with what it was two centuries ago all the arts both of agriculture and manufactures were then extremely rude and imperfect every improvement which we have since made has arisen from our imitation of foreigners and we ought so far to esteem it happy that they had previously made advances in arts and ingenuity but this intercourse is still upheld to our great advantage notwithstanding the advanced state of our manufactures we daily adopt in every art the inventions and improvements of our neighbours the commodity is first imported from abroad to our great discontent while we imagine that it drains us of our money afterwards the art itself is gradually imported to our visible advantage yet we continue still to repine that our neighbours should possess any art industry and invention forgetting that had they not first instructed us we should have been at present barbarians and did they not still continue their instructions the arts must fall into a state of languor and lose that emulation and novelty which contribute so much to their advancement the encrease of domestic industry lays the foundation of foreign commerce where a great number of commodities are raised and perfected for the homemarket there will always be found some which can be exported with advantage but if our neighbours have no art or cultivation they cannot take them because they will have nothing to give in exchange in this respect states are in the same condition as individuals a single man can scarcely be industrious where all his fellowcitizens are idle the riches of the several members of a community contribute to encrease my riches whatever profession may follow they consume the produce of my industry and afford me the produce of theirs in return nor needs any state entertain apprehensions that their neighbours will improve to such a degree in every art and manufacture as to have no demand from them nature by giving a diversity of geniuses climates and soils to different nations has secured their mutual intercourse and commerce as long as they all remain industrious and civilized nay the more the arts encrease in any state the more will be its demands from its industrious neighbours the inhabitants having become opulent and skilful desire to have every commodity in the utmost perfection and as they have plenty of commodities to give in exchange they make large importations from every foreign country the industry of the nations from whom they import receives encouragement their own is also encreased by the sale of the commodities which they give in exchange but what if a nation has any staple commodity such as the woollen manufacture is in england must not the interfering of our neighbours in that manufacture be a loss to us answer that when any commodity is denominated the staple of a kingdom it is supposed that this kingdom has some peculiar and natural advantages for raising the commodity and if notwithstanding these advantages they lose such a manufacture they ought to blame their own idleness or bad government not the industry of their neighbours it ought also to be considered that by the encrease of industry among the neighbouring nations the consumption of every particular species of commodity is also encreased and though foreign manufactures interfere with them in the market the demand for their product may still continue or even encrease and should it diminish ought the consequence to be esteemed so fatal if the spirit of industry be preserved it may easily be diverted from one branch to another and the manufacturers of wool for instance be employed in linen silk iron or any other commodities for which there appears to be a demand we need not apprehend that all the objects of industry will be exhausted or that our manufacturers while they remain on an equal footing with those of our neighbours will be in danger of wanting employment the emulation among rival nations serves rather to keep industry alive in all of them and any people is happier who possess a variety of manufactures than if they enjoyed one single great manufacture in which they are all employed their situation is less precarious and they will feel less sensibly those revolutions and uncertainties to which every particular branch of commerce will always be exposed the only commercial state that ought to dread the improvements and industry of their neighbours is such a one as the dutch who enjoying no extent of land nor possessing any number of native commodities flourish only by their being the brokers and factors and carriers of others such a people may naturally apprehend that as soon as the neighbouring states come to know and pursue their interest they will take into their own hands the management of their affairs and deprive their brokers of that profit which they formerly reaped from it but though this consequence may naturally be dreaded it is very long before it takes place and by art and industry it may be warded off for many generations if not wholly eluded the advantage of superior stocks and correspondence is so great that it is not easily overcome and as all the transactions encrease by the encrease of industry in the neighbouring states even a people whose commerce stands on this precarious basis may at first reap a considerable profit from the flourishing condition of their neighbours the dutch having mortgaged all their revenues make not such a figure in political transactions as formerly but their commerce is surely equal to what it was in the middle of the last century when they were reckoned among the great powers of europe were our narrow and malignant politics to meet with success we should reduce all our neighbouring nations to the same state of sloth and ignorance that prevails in morocco and the coast of barbary but what would be the consequence they could send us no commodities they could take none from us our domestic commerce itself would languish for want of emulation example and instruction and we ourselves should soon fall into the same abject condition to which we had reduced them shall therefore venture to acknowledge that not only as a man but as a british subject pray for the flourishing commerce of germany spain italy and even france itself am at least certain that great britain and all those nations would flourish more did their sovereigns and ministers adopt such enlarged and benevolent sentiments towards each other essay of the balance of power it is a question whether the idea of the balance of power be owing entirely to modern policy or whether the phrase only has been invented in these later ages it is certain that xenophon in his institution of cyrus represents the combination of the asiatic powers to have arisen from a jealousy of the encreasing force of the medes and persians and though that elegant composition should be supposed altogether a romance this sentiment ascribed by the author to the eastern princes is at least a proof of the prevailing notion of ancient times in all the politics of greece the anxiety with regard to the balance of power is apparent and is expressly pointed out to us even by the ancient historians thucydides represents the league which was formed against athens and which produced the peloponnesian war as entirely owing to this principle and after the decline of athens when the thebans and lacedemonians disputed for sovereignty we find that the athenians as well as many other republics always threw themselves into the lighter scale and endeavoured to preserve the balance they supported thebes against sparta till the great victory gained by epaminondas at leuctra after which they immediately went over to the conquered from generosity as they pretended but in reality from their jealousy of the conquerors whoever will read demostheness oration for the megalopolitans may see the utmost refinements on this principle that ever entered into the head of a venetian or english speculatist and upon the first rise of the macedonian power this orator immediately discovered the danger sounded the alarm throughout all greece and at last assembled that confederacy under the banners of athens which fought the great and decisive battle of chaeronea it is true the grecian wars are regarded by historians as wars of emulation rather than of politics and each state seems to have had more in view the honour of leading the rest than any wellgrounded hopes of authority and dominion if we consider indeed the small number of inhabitants in any one republic compared to the whole the great difficulty of forming sieges in those times and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every freeman among that noble people we shall conclude that the balance of power was of itself sufficiently secured in greece and needed not to have been guarded with that caution which may be requisite in other ages but whether we ascribe the shifting of sides in all the grecian republics to jealous emulation or cautious politics the effects were alike and every prevailing power was sure to meet with a confederacy against it and that often composed of its former friends and allies the same principle call it envy or prudence which produced the ostracism of athens and petalism of syracuse and expelled every citizen whose fame or power overtopped the rest the same principle say naturally discovered itself in foreign politics and soon raised enemies to the leading state however moderate in the exercise of its authority the persian monarch was really in his force a petty prince compared to the grecian republics and therefore it behoved him from views of safety more than from emulation to interest himself in their quarrels and to support the weaker side in every contest this was the advice given by alcibiades to tissaphernes and it prolonged near a century the date of the persian empire till the neglect of it for a moment after the first appearance of the aspiring genius of philip brought that lofty and frail edifice to the ground with a rapidity of which there are few instances in the history of mankind the successors of alexander showed great jealousy of the balance of power a jealousy founded on true politics and prudence and which preserved distinct for several ages the partition made after the death of that famous conqueror the fortune and ambition of antigonus threatened them anew with a universal monarchy but their combination and their victory at ipsus saved them and in subsequent times we find that as the eastern princes considered the greeks and macedonians as the only real military force with whom they had any intercourse they kept always a watchful eye over that part of the world the ptolemies in particular supported first aratus and the achaeans and then cleomenes king of sparta from no other view than as a counterbalance to the macedonian monarchs for this is the account which polybius gives of the egyptian politics the reason why it is supposed that the ancients were entirely ignorant of the balance of power seems to be drawn from the roman history more than the grecian and as the transactions of the former are generally more familiar to us we have thence formed all our conclusions it must be owned that the romans never met with any such general combination or confederacy against them as might naturally have been expected from the rapid conquests and declared ambition but were allowed peaceably to subdue their neighbours one after another till they extended their dominion over the whole known world not to mention the fabulous history of theiraitalic wars there was upon hannibals invasion of the roman state a remarkable crisis which ought to have called up the attention of all civilized nations it appeared afterwards nor was it difficult to be observed at the time that this was a contest for universal empire yet no prince or state seems to have been in the least alarmed about the event or issue of the quarrel philip of macedon remained neuter till he saw the victories of hannibal and then most imprudently formed an alliance with the conqueror upon terms still more imprudent he stipulated that he was to assist the carthaginian state in their conquest of italy after which they engaged to send over forces into greece to assist him in subduing the grecian commonwealths the rhodian and achaean republics are much celebrated by ancient historians for their wisdom and sound policy yet both of them assisted the romans in their wars against philip and antiochus and what may be esteemed still a stronger proof that this maxim was not generally known in those ages no ancient author has remarked the imprudence of these measures nor has even blamed that absurd treaty abovementioned made by philip with the carthaginians princes and statesmen in all ages may beforehand be blinded in their reasonings with regard to events but it is somewhat extraordinary that historians afterwards should not form a sounder judgment of them massinissa attalus prusias in gratifying their private passions were all of them the instruments of the roman greatness and never seem to have suspected that they were forging their own chains while they advanced the conquests of their ally a simple treaty and agreement between massinissa and the carthaginians so much required by mutual interest barred the romans from all entrance into africa and preserved liberty to mankind the only prince we meet with in the roman history who seems to have understood the balance of power is hiero king of syracuse though the ally of rome he sent assistance to the carthaginians during the war of the auxiliaries esteeming it requisite says polybius both in order to retain his dominions in sicily and to preserve the roman friendship that carthage should be safe lest by its fall the remaining power should be able without contrast or opposition to execute every purpose and undertaking and here he acted with great wisdom and prudence for that is never on any account to be overlooked nor ought such a force ever to be thrown into one hand as to incapacitate the neighbouring states from defending their rights against it here is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express terms in short the maxim of preserving the balance of power is founded so much on common sense and obvious reasoning that it is impossible it could altogether have escaped antiquity where we find in other particulars so many marks of deep penetration and discernment if it was not so generally known and acknowledged as at present it had at least an influence on all the wiser and more experienced princes and politicians and indeed even at present however generally known and acknowledged among speculative reasoners it has not in practice an authority much more extensive among those who govern the world after the fall of the roman empire the form of government established by the northern conquerors incapacitated them in a great measure for farther conquests and long maintained each state in its proper boundaries but when vassalage and the feudal militia were abolished mankind were anew alarmed by the danger of universal monarchy from the union of so many kingdoms and principalities in the person of the emperor charles but the power of the house of austria founded on extensive but divided dominions and their riches derived chiefly from mines of gold and silver were more likely to decay of themselves from internal defects than to overthrow all the bulwarks raised against them in less than a century the force of that violent and haughty race was shattered their opulence dissipated their splendor eclipsed a new power succeeded more formidable to the liberties of europe possessing all the advantages of the former and labouring under none of its defects except a share of that spirit of bigotry and persecution with which the house of austria was so long and still is so much infatuated b in the general wars maintained against this ambitious power great britain has stood foremost and she still maintains her station beside her advantages of riches and situation her people are animated with such a national spirit and are so fully sensible of the blessings of their government that we may hope their vigour never will languish in so necessary and so just a cause on the contrary if we may judge by the past their passionate ardour seems rather to require some moderation and they have oftener erred from a laudable excess than from a blameable deficiency in the first place we seem to have been more possessed with the ancient greek spirit of jealous emulation than actuated by the prudent views of modern politics our wars with france have been begun with justice and even perhaps from necessity but have always been too far pushed from obstinacy and passion the same peace which was afterwards made at ryswick in was offered so early as the year ninetytwo that concluded at utrecht in might have been finished on as good conditions at gertruytenberg in the year eight and we might have given at frankfort in the same terms which we were glad to accept of at aixlachapelle in the year fortyeight here then we see that above half of our wars with france and all our public debts are owing more to our own imprudent vehemence than to the ambition of our neighbours in the second place we are so declared in our opposition to french power and so alert in defence of our allies that they always reckon upon our force as upon their own and expecting to carry on war at our expence refuse all reasonable terms of accommodation habent subjectos tanquam suos viles ut alienos all the world knows that the factious vote of the house of commons in the beginning of the last parliament with the professed humour of the nation made the queen of hungary inflexible in her terms and prevented that agreement with prussia which would immediately have restored the general tranquillity of europe in the third place we are such true combatants that when once engaged we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity and consider only how we may best annoy the enemy to mortgage our revenues at so deep a rate in wars where we were only accessories was surely the most fatal delusion that a nation which had any pretension to politics and prudence has ever yet been guilty of that remedy of funding if it be a remedy and not rather a poison ought in all reason to be reserved to the last extremity and no evil but the greatest and most urgent should ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an expedient these excesses to which we have been carried are prejudicial and may perhaps in time become still more prejudicial another way by begetting as is usual the opposite extreme and rendering us totally careless and supine with regard to the fate of europe the athenians from the most bustling intriguing warlike people of greece finding their error in thrusting themselves into every quarrel abandoned all attention to foreign affairs and in no contest ever took part on either side except by their flatteries and complaisance to the victor enormous monarchiesc are probably destructive to human nature in their progress in their continuance and even in their downfal which never can be very distant from their establishment the military genius which aggrandized the monarchy soon leaves the court the capital and the center of such a government while the wars are carried on at a great distance and interest so small a part of the state the ancient nobility whose affections attach them to their sovereign live all at court and never will accept of military employments which would carry them to remote and barbarous frontiers where they are distant both from their pleasures and their fortune the arms of the state must therefore be entrusted to mercenary strangers without zeal without attachment without honour ready on every occasion to turn them against the prince and join each desperate malcontent who offers pay and plunder this is the necessary progress of human affairs thus human nature checks itself in its airy elevation thus ambition blindly labours for the destruction of the conqueror of his family and of every thing near and dear to him the bourbons trusting to the support of their brave faithful and affectionate nobility would push their advantage without reserve or limitation these while fired with glory and emulation can bear the fatigues and dangers of war but never would submit to languish in the garrisons of hungary or lithuania forgot at court and sacrificed to the intrigues of every minion or mistress who approaches the prince the troops are filled with cravates and tartars hussars and cossacs intermingled perhaps with a few soldiers of fortune from the better provinces and the melancholy fate of the roman emperors from the same cause is renewed over and over again till the final dissolution of the monarchy essay of taxes there is a prevailing maxima among some reasoners that every new tax creates a new ability in the subject to bear it and that each encrease of public burdens encreases proportionably the industry of the people this maxim is of such a nature as is most likely to be abused and is so much the more dangerous as its truth cannot be altogether denied but it must be owned when kept within certain bounds to have some foundation in reason and experience when a tax is laid upon commodities which are consumed by the common people the necessary consequence may seem to be either that the poor must retrench something from their way of living or raise their wages so as to make the burden of the tax fall entirely upon the rich but there is a third consequence which often follows upon taxes namely that the poor encrease their industry perform more work and live as well as before without demanding more for their labour where taxes are moderate are laid on gradually and affect not the necessaries of life this consequence naturally follows and it is certain that such difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people and render them more opulent and laborious than others who enjoy the greatest advantages for we may observe as a parallel instance that the most commercial nations have not always possessed the greatest extent of fertile land but on the contrary that they have laboured under many natural disadvantages tyre athens carthage rhodes genoa venice holland are strong examples to this purpose and in all history we find only three instances of large and fertile countries which have possessed much trade the netherlands england and france the two former seem to have been allured by the advantages of their maritime situation and the necessity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports in order to procure what their own climate refused them and as to france trade has come late into that kingdom and seems to have been the effect of reflection and observation in an ingenious and enterprizing people who remarked the riches acquired by such of the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigation and commerce the places mentioned by cicero as possessed of the greatest commerce in his time are alexandria colchus tyre sidon andros cyprus pamphylia lycia rhodes chios byzantium lesbos smyrna miletum coos all these except alexandria were either small islands or narrow territories and that city owed its trade entirely to the happiness of its situation since therefore some natural necessities or disadvantages may be thought favourable to industry why may not artificial burdens have the same effect sir william temple we may observe ascribes the industry of the dutch entirely to necessity proceeding from their natural disadvantages and illustrates his doctrine by a striking comparison with ireland where says he by the largeness and plenty of the soil and scarcity of people all things necessary to life are so cheap that an industrious man by two days labour may gain enough to feed him the rest of the week which take to be a very plain ground of the laziness attributed to the people for men naturally prefer ease before labour and will not take pains if they can live idle though when by necessity they have been inured to it they cannot leave it being grown a custom necessary to their health and to their very entertainment nor perhaps is the change harder from constant ease to labour than from constant labour to ease after which the author proceeds to confirm his doctrine by enumerating as above the places where trade has most flourished in ancient and modern times and which are commonly observed to be such narrow confined territories as beget a necessity for industryb the best taxes are such as are levied upon consumptions especially those of luxury because such taxes are least felt by the people they seem in some measure voluntary since a man may chuse how far he will use the commodity which is taxed they are paid gradually and insensiblyc they naturally produce sobriety and frugality if judiciously imposed and being confounded with the natural price of the commodity they are scarcely perceived by the consumers their only disadvantage is that they are expensive in the levying taxes upon possessions are levied without expence but have every other disadvantage most states however are obliged to have recourse to them in order to supply the deficiencies of the other but the most pernicious of all taxes are the arbitrary they are commonly converted by their management into punishments on industry and also by their unavoidable inequality are more grievous than by the real burden which they impose it is surprising therefore to see them have place among any civilized people in general all polltaxes even when not arbitrary which they commonly are may be esteemed dangerous because it is so easy for the sovereign to add a little more and a little more to the sum demanded that these taxes are apt to become altogether oppressive and intolerable on the other hand a duty upon commodities checks itself and a prince will soon find that an encrease of the impost is no encrease of his revenue it is not easy therefore for a people to be altogether ruined by such taxes historians inform us that one of the chief causes of the destruction of the roman state was the alteration which constantine introduced into the finances by substituting an universal polltax in lieu of almost all the tithes customs and excises which formerly composed the revenue of the empire the people in all the provinces were so grinded and oppressed by the publicans that they were glad to take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians whose dominion as they had fewer necessities and less art was found preferable to the refined tyranny of the romans d it is an opinion zealously promoted by some political writers that since all taxes as they pretend fall ultimately upon land it were better to lay them originally there and abolish every duty upon consumptions but it is denied that all taxes fall ultimately upon land if a duty be laid upon any commodity consumed by an artisan he has two obvious expedients for paying it he may retrench somewhat of his expence or he may encrease his labour both these resources are more easy and natural than that of heightening his wages we see that in years of scarcity the weaver either consumes less or labours more or employs both these expedients of frugality and industry by which he is enabled to reach the end of the year it is but just that he should subject himself to the same hardships if they deserve the name for the sake of the publick which gives him protection by what contrivance can he raise the price of his labour the manufacturer who employs him will not give him more neither can he because the merchant who exports the cloth cannot raise its price being limited by the price which it yields in foreign markets every man to be sure is desirous of pushing off from himself the burden of any tax which is imposed and of laying it upon others but as every man has the same inclination and is upon the defensive no set of men can be supposed to prevail altogether in this contest and why the landed gentleman should be the victim of the whole and should not be able to defend himself as well as others are cannot readily imagine all tradesmen indeed would willingly prey upon him and divide him among them if they could but this inclination they always have though no taxes were levied and the same methods by which he guards against the imposition of tradesmen before taxes will serve him afterwards and make them share the burden with him e they must be very heavy taxes indeed and very injudiciously levied which the artizan will not of himself be enabled to pay by superior industry and frugality without raising the price of his labour shall conclude this subject with observing that we have with regard to taxes an instance of what frequently happens in political institutions that the consequences of things are diametrically opposite to what we should expect on the first appearance it is regarded as a fundamental maxim of the turkish government that the grand signior though absolute master of the lives and fortunes of each individual has no authority to impose a new tax and every ottoman prince who has made such an attempt either has been obliged to retract or has found the fatal effects of his perseverance one would imagine that this prejudice or established opinion were the firmest barrier in the world against oppression yet it is certain that its effect is quite contrary the emperor having no regular method of encreasing his revenue must allow all the bashaws and governors to oppress and abuse the subjects and these he squeezes after their return from their government whereas if he could impose a new tax like our european princes his interest would so far be united with that of his people that he would immediately feel the bad effects of these disorderly levies of money and would find that a pound raised by a general imposition would have less pernicious effects than a shilling taken in so unequal and arbitrary a manner essay of public credit it appears to have been the common practice of antiquity to make provision during peace for the necessities of war and to hoard up treasures beforehand as the instruments either of conquest or defence without trusting to extraordinary impositions much less to borrowing in times of disorder and confusion besides the immense sums above mentioned which were amassed by athens and by the ptolemies and other successors of alexander we learn from plato that the frugal lacedemonians had also collected a great treasure and arrian and plutarch take notice of the riches which alexander got possession of on the conquest of susa and ecbatana and which were reserved some of them from the time of cyrus if remember right the scripture also mentions the treasure of hezekiah and the jewish princes as profane history does that of philip and perseus kings of macedon the ancient republics of gaul had commonly large sums in reserve every one knows the treasure seized in rome by julius cæsar during the civil wars and we find afterwards that the wiser emperors augustus tiberius vespasian severus c always discovered the prudent foresight of saving great sums against any public exigency on the contrary our modern expedient which has become very general is to mortgage the public revenues and to trust that posterity will pay off the incumbrances contracted by their ancestors and they having before their eyes so good an example of their wise fathers have the same prudent reliance on their posterity who at last from necessity more than choice are obliged to place the same confidence in a new posterity but not to waste time in declaiming against a practice which appears ruinous a beyond all controversy it seems pretty apparent that the ancient maxims are in this respect more prudent than the modern even though the latter had been confined within some reasonable bounds and had ever in any instance been attended with such frugality in time of peace as to discharge the debts incurred by an expensive war for why should the case be so different between the public and an individual as to make us establish different maxims of conduct for each if the funds of the former be greater its necessary expences are proportionably larger if its resources be more numerous they are not infinite and as its frame should be calculated for a much longer duration than the date of a single life or even of a family it should embrace maxims large durable and generous agreeably to the supposed extent of its existence to trust to chances and temporary expedients is indeed what the necessity of human affairs frequently renders unavoidable but whoever voluntarily depend on such resources have not necessity but their own folly to accuse for their misfortunes when any such befal them if the abuses of treasures be dangerous either by engaging the state in rash enterprizes or making it neglect military discipline in confidence of its riches the abuses of mortgaging are more certain and inevitable poverty impotence and subjection to foreign powers according to modern policy war is attended with every destructive circumstance loss of men encrease of taxes decay of commerce dissipation of money devastation by sea and land according to ancient maxims the opening of the public treasure as it produced an uncommon affluence of gold and silver served as a temporary encouragement to industry and atoned in some degree for the inevitable calamities of war b it is very tempting to a minister to employ such an expedient as enables him to make a great figure during his administration without overburthening the people with taxes or exciting any immediate clamours against himself the practice therefore of contracting debt will almost infallibly be abused in every government it would scarcely be more imprudent to give a prodigal son a credit in every bankers shop in london than to impower a statesman to draw bills in this manner upon posterity what then shall we say to the new paradox that public incumbrances are of themselves advantageous independent of the necessity of contracting them and that any state even though it were not pressed by a foreign enemy could not possibly have embraced a wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches than to create funds and debts and taxes without limitation reasonings such as these might naturally have passed for trials of wit among rhetoricians like the panegyrics on folly and a fever on busiris and nero had we not seen such absurd maxims patronized by great ministers and by a whole party among usc let us examine the consequences of public debts both in our domestic management by their influence on commerce and industry and in our foreign transactions by their effect on wars and negociationsd public securities are with us become a kind of money and pass as readily at the current price as gold or silver wherever any profitable undertaking offers itself how expensive soever there are never wanting hands enow to embrace it nor need a trader who has sums in the public stocks fear to launch out into the most extensive trade since he is possessed of funds which will answer the most sudden demand that can be made upon him no merchant thinks it necessary to keep by him any considerable cash bankstock or indiabonds especially the latter serve all the same purposes because he can dispose of them or pledge them to a banker in a quarter of an hour and at the same time they are not idle even when in his scritoire but bring him in a constant revenue in short our national debts furnish merchants with a species of money that is continually multiplying in their hands and produces sure gain besides the profits of their commerce this must enable them to trade upon less profit the small profit of the merchant renders the commodity cheaper causes a greater consumption quickens the labour of the common people and helps to spread arts and industry throughout the whole society there are also we may observe in england and in all states which have both commerce and public debts a set of men who are half merchants half stockholders and may be supposed willing to trade for small profits because commerce is not their principal or sole support and their revenues in the funds are a sure resource for themselves and their families were there no funds great merchants would have no expedient for realizing or securing any part of their profit but by making purchases of land and land has many disadvantages in comparison of funds requiring more care and inspection it divides the time and attention of the merchant upon any tempting offer or extraordinary accident in trade it is not so easily converted into money and as it attracts too much both by the many natural pleasures it affords and the authority it gives it soon converts the citizen into the country gentleman more men therefore with large stocks and incomes may naturally be supposed to continue in trade where there are public debts and this it must be owned is of some advantage to commerce by diminishing its profits promoting circulation and encouraging industrye but in opposition to these two favourable circumstances perhaps of no very great importance weigh the many disadvantages which attend our public debts in the whole interior œconomy of the state you will find no comparison between the ill and the good which result from them first it is certain that national debts cause a mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital by the great sums levied in the provinces to pay the interest and perhaps too by the advantages in trade above mentioned which they give the merchants in the capital above the rest of the kingdom the question is whether in our case it be for the public interest that so many privileges should be conferred on london which has already arrived at such an enormous size and seems still encreasing some men are apprehensive of the consequences for my own part cannot forbear thinking that though the head is undoubtedly too large for the body yet that great city is so happily situated that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom there is more difference between the prices of all provisions in paris and languedoc than between those in london and yorkshire f the immense greatness indeed of london under a government which admits not of discretionary power renders the people factious mutinous seditious and even perhaps rebellious but to this evil the national debts themselves tend to provide a remedy the first visible eruption or even immediate danger of public disorders must alarm all the stockholders whose property is the most precarious of any and will make them fly to the support of government whether menaced by jacobitish violence or democratical frenzy secondly public stocks being a kind of papercredit have all the disadvantages attending that species of money they banish gold and silver from the most considerable commerce of the state reduce them to common circulation and by that means render all provisions and labour dearer than otherwise they would beg thirdly the taxes which are levied to pay the interests of these debtsh are apt either to heighten the price of labour or be an oppression on the poorer sort fourthly as foreigners possess a great share of our national funds they render the public in a manner tributary to them and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our industry fifthly the greater part of the public stock being always in the hands of idle people who live on their revenue our funds in that view give great encouragement to an useless and unactive life but though the injury that arises to commerce and industry from our public funds will appear upon balancing the whole not inconsiderable it is trivial in comparison of the prejudice that results to the state considered as a body politic which must support itself in the society of nations and have various transactions with other states in wars and negociations the ill there is pure and unmixed without any favourable circumstance to atone for it and it is an ill too of a nature the highest and most important we have indeed been told that the public is no weaker upon account of its debts since they are mostly due among ourselves and bring as much property to one as they take from another it is like transferring money from the right hand to the left which leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before such loose reasonings and specious comparisons will always pass where we judge not upon principles ask is it possible in the nature of things to overburthen a nation with taxes even where the sovereign resides among them the very doubt seems extravagant since it is requisite in every community that there be a certain proportion observed between the laborious and the idle part of it but if all our present taxes be mortgaged must we not invent new ones and may not this matter be carried to a length that is ruinous and destructive in every nation there are always some methods of levying money more easy than others agreeably to the way of living of the people and the commodities they make use of in great britain the excises upon malt and beer afford a large revenue because the operations of malting and brewing are tedious and are impossible to be concealed and at the same time these commodities are not so absolutely necessary to life as that the raising of their price would very much affect the poorer sort these taxes being all mortgaged what difficulty to find new ones what vexation and ruin of the poor duties upon consumptions are more equal and easy than those upon possessions what a loss to the public that the former are all exhausted and that we must have recourse to the more grievous method of levying taxes were all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public must not necessity force them to practise all the arts of oppression used by stewards where the absence or negligence of the proprietor render them secure against enquiry it will scarcely be asserted that no bounds ought ever to be set to national debts and that the public would be no weaker were twelve or fifteen shillings in the pound landtax mortgaged with all the present customs and excises there is something therefore in the case beside the mere transferring of property from the one hand to another in years the posterity of those now in the coaches and of those upon the boxes will probably have changed places without affecting the public by these revolutions i suppose the public once fairly brought to that condition to which it is hastening with such amazing rapidity suppose the land to be taxed eighteen or nineteen shillings in the pound for it can never bear the whole twenty suppose all the excises and customs to be screwed up to the utmost which the nation can bear without entirely losing its commerce and industry and suppose that all those funds are mortgaged to perpetuity and that the invention and wit of all our projectors can find no new imposition which may serve as the foundation of a new loan and let us consider the necessary consequences of this situation though the imperfect state of our political knowledge and the narrow capacities of men make it difficult to fortel the effects which will result from any untried measure the seeds of ruin are here scattered with such profusion as not to escape the eye of the most careless observer in this unnatural state of society the only persons who possess any revenue beyond the immediate effects of their industry are the stockholders who draw almost all the rent of the land and houses besides the produce of all the customs and excises these are men who have no connexions with the state who can enjoy their revenue in any part of the globe in which they chuse to reside who will naturally bury themselves in the capital or in great cities and who will sink into the lethargy of a stupid and pampered luxury without spirit ambition or enjoyment adieu to all ideas of nobility gentry and family the stocks can be transferred in an instant and being in such a fluctuating state will seldom be transmitted during three generations from father to son or were they to remain ever so long in one family they convey no hereditary authority or credit to the possessor and by this means the several ranks of men which form a kind of independent magistracy in a state instituted by the hand of nature are entirely lost and every man in authority derives his influence from the commission alone of the sovereign no expedient remains for preventing or suppressing insurrections but mercenary armies no expedient at all remains for resisting tyranny elections are swayed by bribery and corruption alone and the middle power between king and people being totally removed a grievous despotism must infallibly prevail the landholders despised for their poverty and hated for their oppressions will be utterly unable to make any opposition to it though a resolution should be formed by the legislature never to impose any tax which hurts commerce and discourages industry it will be impossible for men in subjects of such extreme delicacy to reason so justly as never to be mistaken or amidst difficulties so urgent never to be seduced from their resolution the continual fluctuations in commerce require continual alterations in the nature of the taxes which exposes the legislature every moment to the danger both of wilful and involuntary error and any great blow given to trade whether by injudicious taxes or by other accidents throws the whole system of government into confusion but what expedient can the public now employ even supposing trade to continue in the most flourishing condition in order to support its foreign wars and enterprizes and to defend its own honour and interests or those of its allies do not ask how the public is to exert such a prodigious power as it has maintained during our late wars where we have so much exceeded not only our own natural strength but even that of the greatest empires this extravagance is the abuse complained of as the source of all the dangers to which we are at present exposed but since we must still suppose great commerce and opulence to remain even after every fund is mortgaged these riches must be defended by proportional power and whence is the public to derive the revenue which supports it it must plainly be from a continual taxation of the annuitants or which is the same thing from mortgaging anew on every exigency a certain part of their annuities and thus making them contribute to their own defence and to that of the nation but the difficulties attending this system of policy will easily appear whether we suppose the king to have become absolute master or to be still controuled by national councils in which the annuitants themselves must necessarily bear the principal sway if the prince has become absolute as may naturally be expected from this situation of affairs it is so easy for him to encrease his exactions upon the annuitants which amount only to the retaining money in his own hands that this species of property would soon lose all its credit and the whole income of every individual in the state must lie entirely at the mercy of the sovereign a degree of despotism which no oriental monarchy has ever yet attained if on the contrary the consent of the annuitants be requisite for every taxation they will never be persuaded to contribute sufficiently even to the support of government as the diminution of their revenue must in that case be very sensible would not be disguised under the appearance of a branch of excise or customs and would not be shared by any other order of the state who are already supposed to be taxed to the utmost there are instances in some republics of a hundredth penny and sometimes of the fiftieth being given to the support of the state but this is always an extraordinary exertion of power and can never become the foundation of a constant national defence we have always found where a government has mortgaged all its revenues that it necessarily sinks into a state of languor inactivity and impotence such are the inconveniencies which may reasonably be foreseen of this situation to which great britain is visibly tending not to mention the numberless inconveniencies which cannot be foreseen and which must result from so monstrous a situation as that of making the public the chief or sole proprietor of land besides investing it with every branch of customs and excise which the fertile imagination of ministers and projectors have been able to invent must confess that there is a strange supineness from long custom creeped into all ranks of men with regard to public debts not unlike what divines so vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines we all own that the most sanguine imagination cannot hope either that this or any future ministry will be possessed of such rigid and steady frugality as to make a considerable progress in the payment of our debts or that the situation of foreign affairs will for any long time allow them leisure and tranquillity for such an undertakingjwhat then is to become of us were we ever so good christians and ever so resigned to providence this methinks were a curious question even considered as a speculative one and what it might not be altogether impossible to form some conjectural solution of the events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles negociations intrigues and factions there seems to be a natural progress of things which may guide our reasoning as it would have required but a moderate share of prudence when we first began this practice of mortgaging to have foretold from the nature of men and of ministers that things would necessarily be carried to the length we see so now that they have at last happily reached it it may not be difficult to guess at the consequences it must indeed be one of these two events either the nation must destroy public credit or public credit will destroy the nation it is impossible that they can both subsist after the manner they have been hitherto managed in this as well as in some other countries there was indeed a scheme for the payment of our debts which was proposed by an excellent citizen mr hutchinson above thirty years ago and which was much approved of by some men of sense but never was likely to take effect he asserted that there was a fallacy in imagining that the public owed this debt for that really every individual owed a proportional share of it and paid in his taxes a proportional share of the interest beside the expence of levying these taxes had we not better then says he make a distribution of the debt among ourselves and each of us contribute a sum suitable to his property and by that means discharge at once all our funds and public mortgages he seems not to have considered that the laborious poor pay a considerable part of the taxes by their annual consumptions though they could not advance at once a proportional part of the sum required not to mention that property in money and stock in trade might easily be concealed or disguised and that visible property in lands and houses would really at last answer for the whole an inequality and oppression which never would be submitted to but though this project is not likely to take place it is not altogether improbable that when the nation becomes heartily sick of their debts and is cruelly oppressed by them some daring projector may arise with visionary schemes for their discharge and as public credit will begin by that time to be a little frail the least touch will destroy it as happened in france during the regency and in this manner it will die of the doctork but it is more probable that the breach of national faith will be the necessary effect of wars defeats misfortunes and public calamities or even perhaps of victories and conquests must confess when see princes and states fighting and quarrelling amidst their debts funds and public mortgages it always brings to my mind a match of cudgelplaying fought in a china shop how can it be expected that sovereigns will spare a species of property which is pernicious to themselves and to the public when they have so little compassion on lives and properties that are useful to both let the time come and surely it will come when the new funds created for the exigencies of the year are not subscribed to and raise not the money projected suppose either that the cash of the nation is exhausted or that our faith which has hitherto been so ample begins to fail us suppose that in this distress the nation is threatened with an invasion a rebellion is suspected or broken out at home a squadron cannot be equipped for want of pay victuals or repairs or even a foreign subsidy cannot be advanced what must a prince or minister do in such an emergence the right of selfpreservation is unalienable in every individual much more in every community and the folly of our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who first contracted debt or what is more than that of those who trusted or continue to trust this security if these statesmen have the means of safety in their hands and do not employ them the funds created and mortgaged will by that time bring in a large yearly revenue sufficient for the defence and security of the nation money is perhaps lying in the exchequer ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest necessity calls fear urges reason exhorts compassion alone exclaims the money will immediately be seized for the current service under the most solemn protestations perhaps of being immediately replaced but no more is requisite the whole fabric already tottering falls to the ground and buries thousands in its ruins and this think may be called the natural death of public credit for to this period it tends as naturally as an animal body to its dissolution and destruction l so great dupes are the generality of mankind that notwithstanding such a violent shock to public credit as a voluntary bankruptcy in england would occasion it would not probably be long ere credit would again revive in as flourishing a condition as before the present king of france during the late war borrowed money at lower interest than ever his grandfather did and as low as the british parliament comparing the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms and though men are commonly more governed by what they have seen than by what they foresee with whatever certainty yet promises protestations fair appearances with the allurements of present interest have such powerful influence as few are able to resist mankind are in all ages caught by the same baits the same tricks played over and over again still trepan them the heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny flattery to treachery standing armies to arbitrary government and the glory of god to the temporal interest of the clergy the fear of an everlasting destruction of credit allowing it to be an evil is a needless bugbear a prudent man in reality would rather lend to the public immediately after we had taken a spunge to our debts than at present as much as an opulent knave even though one could not force him to pay is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt for the former in order to carry on business may find it his interest to discharge his debts where they are not exorbitant the latter has it not in his power the reasoning of tacitus as it is eternally true is very applicable to our present case sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum aderat stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur apud sapientes cassa habebantur quæ neque dari neque accipi salva republica poterant the public is a debtor whom no man can oblige to pay the only check which the creditors have upon her is the interest of preserving credit an interest which may easily be overbalanced by a great debt and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence even supposing that credit irrecoverable not to mention that a present necessity often forces states into measures which are strictly speaking against their interest these two events supposed above are calamitous but not the most calamitous thousands are thereby sacrificed to the safety of millions but we are not without danger that the contrary event may take place and that millions may be sacrificed for ever to the temporary safety of thousands our popular government perhaps will render it difficult or dangerous for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient as that of a voluntary bankruptcy and though the house of lords be altogether composed of proprietors of land and the house of commons chiefly and consequently neither of them can be supposed to have great property in the funds yet the connections of the members may be so great with the proprietors as to render them more tenacious of public faith than prudence policy or even justice strictly speaking requires and perhaps too our foreign enemiesm may be so politic as to discover that our safety lies in despair and may not therefore show the danger open and barefaced till it be inevitable the balance of power in europe our grandfathers our fathers and we have all deemed too unequal to be preserved without our attention and assistance but our children weary of the struggle and fettered with incumbrances may sit down secure and see their neighbours oppressed and conquered till at last they themselves and their creditors lie both at the mercy of the conqueror and this may properly enough be denominated the violent death of our public credit these seem to be the events which are not very remote and which reason foresees as clearly almost as she can do any thing that lies in the womb of time and though the ancients maintained that in order to reach the gift of prophecy a certain divine fury or madness was requisite one may safely affirm that in order to deliver such prophecies as these no more is necessary than merely to be in ones senses free from the influence of popular madness and delusion essay of some remarkable customs shall observe three remarkable customs in three celebrated governments and shall conclude from the whole that all general maxims in politics ought to be established with great caution and that irregular and extraordinary appearances are frequently discovered in the moral as well as in the physical world the former perhaps we can better account for after they happen from springs and principles of which every one has within himself or from observation the strongest assurance and conviction but it is often fully as impossible for human prudence beforehand to foresee and foretel them one would think it essential to every supreme council or assembly which debates that entire liberty of speech should be granted to every member and that all motions or reasonings should be received which can any wise tend to illustrate the point under deliberation one would conclude with still greater assurance that after a motion was made which was voted and approved by that assembly in which the legislative power is lodged the member who made the motion must for ever be exempted from future trial or enquiry but no political maxim can at first sight appear more undisputable than that he must at least be secured from all inferior jurisdiction and that nothing less than the same supreme legislative assembly in their subsequent meetings could make him accountable for those motions and harangues to which they had before given their approbation but these axioms however irrefragable they may appear have all failed in the athenian government from causes and principles too which appear almost inevitable by the γραφ παρανόμων or indictment of illegality though it has not been remarked by antiquaries or commentators any man was tried and punished in a common court of judicature for any law which had passed upon his motion in the assembly of the people if that law appeared to the court unjust or prejudicial to the public thus demosthenes finding that shipmoney was levied irregularly and that the poor bore the same burden as the rich in equipping the gallies corrected this inequality by a very useful law which proportioned the expence to the revenue and income of each individual he moved for this law in the assembly he proved its advantages he convinced the people the only legislature in athens the law passed and was carried into execution yet was he tried in a criminal court for that law upon the complaint of the rich who resented the alteration that he had introduced into the finances he was indeed acquitted upon proving anew the usefulness of his law ctesiphon moved in the assembly of the people that particular honours should be conferred on demosthenes as on a citizen affectionate and useful to the commonwealth the people convinced of this truth voted those honours yet was ctesiphon tried by the γραφ παρανόμων it was asserted among other topics that demosthenes was not a good citizen nor affectionate to the commonwealth and the orator was called upon to defend his friend and consequently himself which he executed by that sublime piece of eloquence that has ever since been the admiration of mankind after the battle of chæronea a law was passed upon the motion of hyperides giving liberty to slaves and inrolling them in the troops on account of this law the orator was afterwards tried by the indictment abovementioned and defended himself among other topics by that stroke celebrated by plutarch and longinus it was not said he that moved for this law it was the necessities of war it was the battle ofchæronea the orations of demosthenes abound with many instances of trials of this nature and prove clearly that nothing was more commonly practised the athenian democracy was such a tumultuous government as we can scarcely form a notion of in the present age of the world the whole collective body of the people voted in every law without any limitation of property without any distinction of rank without controul from any magistracy or senate and consequently without regard to order justice or prudence the athenians soon became sensible of the mischiefs attending this constitution but being averse to checking themselves by any rule or restriction they resolved at least to check their demagogues or counsellors by the fear of future punishment and enquiry they accordingly instituted this remarkable law a law esteemed so essential to their form of government that æschines insists on it as a known truth that were it abolished or neglected it were impossible for the democracy to subsist the people feared not any ill consequence to liberty from the authority of the criminal courts because these were nothing but very numerous juries chosen by lot from among the people and they justly considered themselves as in a state of perpetual pupillage where they had an authority after they came to the use of reason not only to retract and controul whatever had been determined but to punish any guardian for measures which they had embraced by his persuasion the same law had place in thebes and for the same reason it appears to have been a usual practice in athens on the establishment of any law esteemed very useful or popular to prohibit for ever its abrogation and repeal thus the demagogue who diverted all the public revenues to the support of shows and spectacles made it criminal so much as to move for a repeal of this law thus leptines moved for a law not only to recal all the immunities formerly granted but to deprive the people for the future of the power of granting any more thus all bills of attainder were forbid or laws that affected one athenian without extending to the whole commonwealth these absurd clauses by which the legislature vainly attempted to bind itself for ever proceeded from an universal sense in the people of their own levity and inconstancy a wheel within a wheel such as we observe in the german empire is considered by lord shaftesbury as an absurdity in politics but what must we say to two equal wheels which govern the same political machine without any mutual check controul or subordination and yet preserve the greatest harmony and concord to establish two distinct legislatures each of which possesses full and absolute authority within itself and stands in no need of the others assistance in order to give validity to its acts this may appear beforehand altogether impracticable as long as men are actuated by the passions of ambition emulation and avarice which have hitherto been their chief governing principles and should assert that the state have in my eye was divided into two distinct factions each of which predominated in a distinct legislature and yet produced no clashing in these independent powers the supposition may appear incredible and if to augment the paradox should affirm that this disjointed irregular government was the most active triumphant and illustrious commonwealth that ever yet appeared should certainly be told that such a political chimera was as absurd as any vision of priests or poets but there is no need for searching long in order to prove the reality of the foregoing suppositions for this was actually the case with the roman republic the legislative power was there lodged in the comitia centuriata and comitia tributa in the former it is well known the people voted according to their census so that when the first class was unanimous though it contained not perhaps the hundredth part of the commonwealth it determined the whole and with the authority of the senate established a law in the latter every vote was equal and as the authority of the senate was not there requisite the lower people entirely prevailed and gave law to the whole state in all partydivisions at first between the patricians and plebeians afterwards between the nobles and the people the interest of the aristocracy was predominant in the first legislature that of the democracy in the second the one could always destroy what the other had established nay the one by a sudden and unforeseen motion might take the start of the other and totally annihilate its rival by a vote which from the nature of the constitution had the full authority of a law but no such contest is observed in the history of rome no instance of a quarrel between these two legislatures though many between the parties that governed in each whence arose this concord which may seem so extraordinary the legislature established in rome by the authority of servius tullius was the comitia centuriata which after the expulsion of the kings rendered the government for some time very aristocratical but the people having numbers and force on their side and being elated with frequent conquests and victories in their foreign wars always prevailed when pushed to extremity and first extorted from the senate the magistracy of the tribunes and next the legislative power of the comitia tributa it then behoved the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people for beside the force which the latter were always possessed of they had now got possession of legal authority and could instantly break in pieces any order or institution which directly opposed them by intrigue by influence by money by combination and by the respect paid to their character the nobles might often prevail and direct the whole machine of government but had they openly set their comitia centuriata in opposition to the tributa they had soon lost the advantage of that institution together with their consuls prætors ediles and all the magistrates elected by it but the comitia tributa not having the same reason for respecting the centuriata frequently repealed laws favourable to the aristocracy they limited the authority of the nobles protected the people from oppression and controuled the actions of the senate and magistracy the centuriata found it convenient always to submit and though equal in authority yet being inferior in power durst never directly give any shock to the other legislature either by repealing its laws or establishing laws which it foresaw would soon be repealed by it no instance is found of any opposition or struggle between these comitia except one slight attempt of this kind mentioned by appian in the third book of his civil warsmark anthony resolving to deprive decimus brutus of the government of cisalpine gaul railed in the forum and called one of the comitia in order to prevent the meeting of the other which had been ordered by the senate but affairs were then fallen into such confusion and the roman constitution was so near its final dissolution that no inference can be drawn from such an expedient this contest besides was founded more on form than party it was the senate who ordered the comitia tributa that they might obstruct the meeting of the centuriata which by the constitution or at least forms of the government could alone dispose of provinces cicero was recalled by the comitia centuriata though banished by the tributa that is by a plebiscitum but his banishment we may observe never was considered as a legal deed arising from the free choice and inclination of the people it was always ascribed to the violence alone of clodius and to the disorders introduced by him into the government the third custom which we purpose to remark regards england and though it be not so important as those which we have pointed out in athens and rome is no less singular and unexpected it is a maxim in politics which we readily admit as undisputed and universal that a power however great when granted by law to an eminent magistrate is not so dangerous to liberty as an authority however inconsiderable which he acquires from violence and usurpation for besides that the law always limits every power which it bestows the very receiving it as a concession establishes the authority whence it is derived and preserves the harmony of the constitution by the same right that one prerogative is assumed without law another may also be claimed and another with still greater facility while the first usurpations both serve as precedents to the following and give force to maintain them hence the heroism of hampdens conduct who sustained the whole violence of royal prosecution rather than pay a tax of twenty shillings not imposed by parliament hence the care of all english patriots to guard against the first encroachments of the crown and hence alone the existence at this day of english liberty there is however one occasion where the parliament has departed from this maxim and that is in the pressing of seamen the exercise of an irregular power is here tacitly permitted in the crown and though it has frequently been under deliberation how that power might be rendered legal and granted under proper restrictions to the sovereign no safe expedient could ever be proposed for that purpose and the danger to liberty always appeared greater from law than from usurpation while this power is exercised to no other end than to man the navy men willingly submit to it from a sense of its use and necessity and the sailors who are alone affected by it find no body to support them in claiming the rights and privileges which the law grants without distinction to all english subjects but were this power on any occasion made an instrument of faction or ministerial tyranny the opposite faction and indeed all lovers of their country would immediately take the alarm and support the injured party the liberty of englishmen would be asserted juries would be implacable and the tools of tyranny acting both against law and equity would meet with the severest vengeance on the other hand were the parliament to grant such an authority they would probably fall into one of these two inconveniencies they would either bestow it under so many restrictions as would make it lose its effect by cramping the authority of the crown or they would render it so large and comprehensive as might give occasion to great abuses for which we could in that case have no remedy the very irregularity of the practice at present prevents its abuses by affording so easy a remedy against them pretend not by this reasoning to exclude all possibility of contriving a register for seamen which might man the navy without being dangerous to liberty only observe that no satisfactory scheme of that nature has yet been proposed rather than adopt any project hitherto invented we continue a practice seemingly the most absurd and unaccountable authority in times of full internal peace and concord is armed against law a continued violence is permitted in the crown amidst the greatest jealousy and watchfulness in the people nay proceeding from those very principles liberty in a country of the highest liberty is left entirely to its own defence without any countenance or protection the wild state of nature is renewed in one of the most civilized societies of mankind and great violence and disordera are committed with impunity while the one party pleads obedience to the supreme magistrate the other the sanction of fundamental laws essay of the populousness of ancient nationsa there is very little ground either from reason or observation to conclude the world eternal or incorruptible the continual and rapid motion of matter the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated the changes remarked in the heavens the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world and its passage by corruption or dissolution from one state or order to another it must therefore as well as each individual form which it contains have its infancy youth manhood and old age and it is probable that in all these variations man equally with every animal and vegetable will partake in the flourishing age of the world it may be expected that the human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body more prosperous health higher spirits longer life and a stronger inclination and power of generation but if the general system of things and human society of course have any such gradual revolutions they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition stature and force of body length of life even courage and extent of genius seem hitherto to have been naturally in all ages pretty much the same the arts and sciences indeed have flourished in one period and have decayed in another but we may observe that at the time when they rose to greatest perfection among one people they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations and though they universally decayed in one age yet in a succeeding generation they again revived and diffused themselves over the world as far therefore as observation reaches there is no universal difference discernible in the human species and though it were allowed that the universe like an animal body had a natural progress from infancy to old age yet as it must still be uncertain whether at present it be advancing to its point of perfection or declining from it we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature to prove therefore or account for that superior populousness of antiquity which is commonly supposed by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world will scarcely be admitted by any just reasoner these general physical causes ought entirely to be excluded from this question there are indeed some more particular physical causes of importance diseases are mentioned in antiquity which are almost unknown to modern medicine and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves of which there are no traces in ancient history in this particular we may observe upon comparison that the disadvantage is much on the side of the moderns not to mention some others of less moment the smallpox commits such ravages as would almost alone account for the great superiority ascribed to ancient times the tenth or the twelfth part of mankind destroyed every generation should make a vast difference it may be thought in the numbers of the people and when joined to venereal distempers a new plague diffused every where this disease is perhaps equivalent by its constant operation to the three great scourges of mankind war pestilence and famine were it certain therefore that ancient times were more populous than the present and could no moral causes be assigned for so great a change these physical causes alone in the opinion of many would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head but is it certain that antiquity was so much more populous as is pretended the extravagancies of vossius with regard to this subject are well known but an author of much greater genius and discernment has ventured to affirm that according to the best computations which these subjects will admit of there are not now on the face of the earth the fiftieth part of mankind which existed in the time of julius cæsar it may easily be observed that the comparison in this case must be imperfect even though we confine ourselves to the scene of ancient history europe and the nations round the mediterranean we know not exactly the numbers of any european kingdom or even city at present how can we pretend to calculate those of ancient cities and states where historians have left us such imperfect traces for my part the matter appears to me so uncertain that as intend to throw together some reflections on that head shall intermingle the enquiry concerning causes with that concerning facts which ought never to be admitted where the facts can be ascertained with any tolerable assurance we shall first consider whether it be probable from what we know of the situation of society in both periods that antiquity must have been more populous secondly whether in reality it was so if can make it appear that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended in favour of antiquity it is all aspire to in general we may observe that the question with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms implies important consequences and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police their manners and the constitution of their government for as there is in all men both male and female a desire and power of generation more active than is ever universally exerted the restraints which they lie under must proceed from some difficulties in their situation which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one and the human species at this rate of propagation would more than double every generationb how fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement where it is an easy matter to provide for a family and where men are nowise straitened or confined as in long established governments history tells us frequently of plagues which have swept away the third or fourth part of a people yet in a generation or two the destruction was not perceived and the society had again acquired their former number the lands which were cultivated the houses built the commodities raised the riches acquired enabled the people who escaped immediately to marry and to rear families which supplied the place of those who had perished and for a like reason every wise just and mild government by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure will always abound most in people as well as in commodities and richesc a country indeed whose climate and soil are fitted for vines will naturally be more populous than one which produces corn only and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage in general warm climates as the necessities of the inhabitants are there fewer and vegetation more powerful are likely to be most populous but if every thing else be equal it seems natural to expect that wherever there are most happiness and virtue and the wisest institutions there will also be most people the question therefore concerning the populousness of ancient and modern times being allowed of great importance it will be requisite if we would bring it to some determination to compare both the domestic and political situation of these two periods in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes which is the first view in which we proposed to consider them the chief difference between the domestic œconomy of the ancients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery which prevailed among the former and which has been abolished for some centuries throughout the greater part of europe some passionate admirers of the ancients and zealous partizans of civil liberty for these sentiments as they are both of them in the main extremely just are found to be almost inseparable cannot forbear regretting the loss of this institution and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery they would gladly reduce the greater part of mankind to real slavery and subjection but to one who considers coolly on the subject it will appear that human nature in general really enjoys more liberty at present in the most arbitrary government of europe than it ever did during the most flourishing period of ancient times as much as submission to a petty prince whose dominions extend not beyond a single city is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever the more the master is removed from us in place and rank the greater liberty we enjoy the less are our actions inspected and controled and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes between our own subjection and the freedom and even dominion of another the remains which are found of domestic slavery in the american colonies and among some european nations would never surely create a desire of rendering it more universal the little humanity commonly observed in persons accustomed from their infancy to exercise so great authority over their fellowcreatures and to trample upon human nature were sufficient alone to disgust us with that unbounded dominion nor can a more probable reason be assigned for the severe might say barbarous manners of ancient times than the practice of domestic slavery by which every man of rank was rendered a petty tyrant and educated amidst the flattery submission and low debasement of his slaves according to ancient practice all checks were on the inferior to restrain him to the duty of submission none on the superior to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity in modern times a bad servant finds not easily a good master nor a bad master a good servant and the checks are mutual suitably to the inviolable and eternal laws of reason and equity the custom of exposing old useless or sick slaves in an island of the tyber there to starve seems to have been pretty common in rome and whoever recovered after having been so exposed had his liberty given him by an edict of the emperor claudius in which it was likewise forbidden to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness but supposing that this edict was strictly obeyed would it better the domestic treatment of slaves or render their lives much more comfortable we may imagine what others would practise when it was the professed maxim of the elder cato to sell his superannuated slaves for any price rather than maintain what he esteemed a useless burden the ergastula or dungeons where slaves in chains were forced to work were very common all over italy columella advises that they be always built under ground and recommends it as the duty of a careful overseer to call over every day the names of these slaves like the mustering of a regiment or ships company in order to know presently when any of them had deserted a proof of the frequency of these ergastula and of the great number of slaves usually confined in themd a chained slave for a porter was usual in rome as appears from ovid and other authors had not these people shaken off all sense of compassion towards that unhappy part of their species would they have presented their friends at the first entrance with such an image of the severity of the master and misery of the slave nothing so common in all trials even of civil causes as to call for the evidence of slaves which was always extorted by the most exquisite torments demosthenes says that where it was possible to produce for the same fact either freemen or slaves as witnesses the judges always preferred the torturing of slaves as a more certain evidence seneca draws a picture of that disorderly luxury which changes day into night and night into day and inverts every stated hour of every office in life among other circumstances such as displacing the meals and times of bathing he mentions that regularly about the third hour of the night the neighbours of one who indulges this false refinement hear the noise of whips and lashes and upon enquiry find that he is then taking an account of the conduct of his servants and giving them due correction and discipline this is not remarked as an instance of cruelty but only of disorder which even in actions the most usual and methodical changes the fixed hours that an established custom had assigned for them but our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state it is pretended that in this particular the ancient practice had infinitely the advantage and was the chief cause of that extreme populousness which is supposed in those times at present all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants and admit not by any means the marriage of the female who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for their service but where the property of the servants is lodged in the master their marriage forms his riches and brings him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled he encourages therefore their propagation as much as that of his cattle rears the young with the same care and educates them to some art or calling which may render them more useful or valuable to him the opulent are by this policy interested in the being at least though not in the wellbeing of the poor and enrich themselves by encreasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them each man being a sovereign in his own family has the same interest with regard to it as the prince with regard to the state and has not like the prince any opposite motives of ambition or vainglory which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty all of it is at all times under his eye and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects such are the consequences of domestic slavery according to the first aspect and appearance of things but if we enter more deeply into the subject we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations the comparison is shocking between the management of human creatures and that of cattle but being extremely just when applied to the present subject it may be proper to trace the consequences of it at the capital near all great cities in all populous rich industrious provinces few cattle are bred provisions lodging attendance labour are there dear and men find their account better in buying the cattle after they come to a certain age from the remoter and cheaper countries these are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle and by a parity of reason for men too when the latter are put on the same footing with the former to rear a child in london till he could be serviceable would cost much dearer than to buy one of the same age from scotland or ireland where he had been bred in a cottage covered with rags and fed on oatmeal or potatoes those who had slaves therefore in all the richer and more populous countries would discourage the pregnancy of the females and either prevent or destroy the birth the human species would perish in those places where it ought to encrease the fastest and a perpetual recruit be wanted from the poorer and more desert provinces such a continued drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us where every man is master of himself and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature not the calculations of sordid interest if london at present without much encreasing needs a yearly recruit from the country of people as is usually computed what must it require if the greater part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves and were hindered from breeding by their avaricious masters all ancient authors tell us that there was a perpetual flux of slaves to italy from the remoter provinces particularly syria ciliciacappadocia and the lesser asia thrace and ægypt yet the number of people did not encrease in italy and writers complain of the continual decay of industry and agriculture where then is that extreme fertility of the roman slaves which is commonly supposed so far from multiplying they could not it seems so much as keep up the stock without immense recruits and though great numbers were continually manumitted and converted into roman citizens the numbers even of these did not encrease till the freedom of the city was communicated to foreign provinces the term for a slave born and bred in the family was verna and these slaves seem to have been entitled by custom to privileges and indulgences beyond others a sufficient reason why the masters would not be fond of rearing many of that kind whoever is acquainted with the maxims of our planters will acknowledge the justness of this observation atticus is much praised by his historian for the care which he took in recruiting his family from the slaves born in it may we not thence infer that this practice was not then very common the names of slaves in the greek comedies syrus mysus geta thrax davus lydus phryx c afford a presumption that at athens at least most of the slaves were imported from foreign countries the athenians says strabo gave to their slaves either the names of the nations whence they were bought as lydus syrus or the names that were most common among those nations as manes or midas to a phrygian tibias to a paphlagonian demosthenes having mentioned a law which forbad any man to strike the slave of another praises the humanity of this law and adds that if the barbarians from whom the slaves were bought had information that their countrymen met with such gentle treatment they would entertain a great esteem for the atheniansisocrates too insinuates that the slaves of the greeks were generally or very commonly barbariansfaristotle in his politics plainly supposes that a slave is always a foreigner the ancient comic writers represented the slaves as speaking a barbarous language this was an imitation of nature it is well known that demosthenes in his nonage had been defrauded of a large fortune by his tutors and that afterwards he recovered by a prosecution at law the value of his patrimony his orations on that occasion still remain and contain an exact detail of the whole substance left by his father in money merchandise houses and slaves together with the value of each particular among the rest were slaves handicraftsmen namely swordcutlers and cabinetmakers all males not a word of any wives children or family which they certainly would have had had it been a common practice at athens to breed from the slaves and the value of the whole must have much depended on that circumstance no female slaves are even so much as mentioned except some housemaids who belonged to his mother this argument has great force if it be not altogether conclusive consider this passage of plutarch speaking of the elder cato he had a great number of slaves whom he took care to buy at the sales of prisoners of war and he chose them young that they might easily be accustomed to any diet or manner of life and be instructed in any business or labour as men teach any thing to young dogs or horsesand esteeming love the chief source of all disorders he allowed the male slaves to have a commerce with the female in his family upon paying a certain sum for this privilege but he strictly prohibited all intrigues out of his family are there any symptoms in this narration of that care which is supposed in the ancients of the marriage and propagation of their slaves if that was a common practice founded on general interest it would surely have been embraced by cato who was a great œconomist and lived in times when the ancient frugality and simplicity of manners were still in credit and reputation it is expressly remarked by the writers of the roman law that scarcely any ever purchase slaves with a view of breeding from them our lackeys and housemaids own do not serve much to multiply their species but the ancients besides those who attended on their person had almost all their labour performed g and even manufactures executed by slaves who lived many of them in their family and some great men possessed to the number of if there be any suspicion therefore that this institution was unfavourable to propagation and the same reason at least in part holds with regard to ancient slaves as modern servants how destructive must slavery have proved history mentions a roman nobleman who had slaves under the same roof with him and having been assassinated at home by the furious revenge of one of them the law was executed with rigour and all without exception were put to death many other roman noblemen had families equally or more numerous and believe every one will allow that this would scarcely be practicable were we to suppose all the slaves married and the females to be breeders so early as the poet hesiod married slaves whether male or female were esteemed inconvenient how much more where families had encreased to such an enormous size as in rome and where the ancient simplicity of manners was banished from all ranks of people xenophon in his oeconomics where he gives directions for the management of a farm recommends a strict care and attention of laying the male and the female slaves at a distance from each other he seems not to suppose that they are ever married the only slaves among the greeks that appear to have continued their own race were the helotes who had houses apart and were more the slaves of the public than of individuals h the same author tells us that niciass overseer by agreement with his master was obliged to pay him an obolus a day for each slave besides maintaining them and keeping up the number had the ancient slaves been all breeders this last circumstance of the contract had been superfluous the ancients talk so frequently of a fixed stated portion of provisions assigned to each slave that we are naturally led to conclude that slaves lived almost all single and received that portion as a kind of boardwages the practice indeed of marrying slaves seems not to have been very common even among the countrylabourers where it is more naturally to be expected cato enumerating the slaves requisite to labour a vineyard of a hundred acres makes them amount to the overseer and his wife villicus and villica and male slaves for an olive plantation of acres the overseer and his wife and male slaves and so in proportion to a greater or less plantation or vineyard varro quoting this passage of cato allows his computation to be just in every respect except the last for as it is requisite says he to have an overseer and his wife whether the vineyard or plantation be great or small this must alter the exactness of the proportion had catos computation been erroneous in any other respect it had certainly been corrected by varro who seems fond of discovering so trivial an error the same author as well as columella recommends it as requisite to give a wife to the overseer in order to attach him the more strongly to his masters service this was therefore a peculiar indulgence granted to a slave in whom so great confidence was reposed in the same place varro mentions it as an useful precaution not to buy too many slaves from the same nation lest they beget factions and seditions in the family a presumption that in italy the greater part even of the country labouring slaves for he speaks of no other were bought from the remoter provinces all the world knows that the family slaves in rome who were instruments of show and luxury were commonly imported from the east hoc profecere says pliny speaking of the jealous care of masters mancipiorum legiones et in domo turba externa ac servorum quoque causa nomenclator adhibendus it is indeed recommended by varro to propagate young shepherds in the family from the old ones for as grasing farms were commonly in remote and cheap places and each shepherd lived in a cottage apart his marriage and encrease were not liable to the same inconveniencies as in dearer places and where many servants lived in the family which was universally the case in such of the roman farms as produced wine or corn if we consider this exception with regard to shepherds and weigh the reasons of it it will serve for a strong confirmation of all our foregoing suspicions columella own advises the master to give a reward and even liberty to a female slave that had reared him above three children a proof that sometimes the ancients propagated from their slaves which indeed cannot be denied were it otherwise the practice of slavery being so common in antiquity must have been destructive to a degree which no expedient could repair all pretend to infer from these reasonings is that slavery is in general disadvantageous both to the happiness and populousness of mankind and that its place is much better supplied by the practice of hired servants the laws or as some writers call them the seditions of the gracchi were occasioned by their observing the encrease of slaves all over italy and the diminution of free citizens appian ascribes this encrease to the propagation of the slaves plutarch to the purchasing of barbarians who were chained and imprisoned βαρβαρικα δεσμωτηρια it is to be presumed that both causes concurred sicily says florus was full of ergastula and was cultivated by labourers in chains eunus and athenio excited the servile war by breaking up these monstrous prisons and giving liberty to slaves the younger pompey augmented his army in spain by the same expedient if the country labourers throughout the roman empire were so generally in this situation and if it was difficult or impossible to find separate lodgings for the families of the city servants how unfavourable to propagation as well as to humanity must the institution of domestic slavery be esteemed constantinople at present requires the same recruits of slaves from all the provinces that rome did of old and these provinces are of consequence far from being populous egypt according to mons maillet sends continual colonies of black slaves to the other parts of the turkish empire and receives annually an equal return of white the one brought from the inland parts of africa the other from mingrelia circassia and tartary our modern convents are no doubt bad institutions but there is reason to suspect that anciently every great family in italy and probably in other parts of the world was a species of convent and though we have reason to condemn all those popish institutions as nurseriesj of superstition burthensome to the public and oppressive to the poor prisoners male as well as female yet may it be questioned whether they be so destructive to the populousness of a state as is commonly imagined were the land which belongs to a convent bestowed on a nobleman he would spend its revenue on dogs horses grooms footmen cooks and housemaids and his family would not furnish many more citizens than the convent the common reason why any parent thrusts his daughters into nunneries is that he may not be overburthened with too numerous a family but the ancients had a method almost as innocent and more effectual to that purpose to wit exposing their children in early infancy this practice was very common and is not spoken of by any author of those times with the horror it deserves or scarcely even with disapprobation plutarch the humane goodnatured plutarch mentions it as a merit in attalus king of pergamus that he murdered or if you will exposed all his own children in order to leave his crown to the son of his brother eumenes signalizing in this manner his gratitude and affection to eumenes who had left him his heir preferably to that son it was solon the most celebrated of the sages of greece that gave parents permission by law to kill their children shall we then allow these two circumstances to compensate each other to wit monastic vows and the exposing of children and to be unfavourable in equal degrees to the propagation of mankind doubt the advantage is here on the side of antiquity perhaps by an odd connexion of causes the barbarous practice of the ancients might rather render those times more populous by removing the terrors of too numerous a family it would engage many people in marriage and such is the force of natural affection that very few in comparison would have resolution enough when it came to the push to carry into execution their former intentions china the only country where this practice of exposing children prevails at present is the most populous country we know of and every man is married before he is twenty such early marriages could scarcely be general had not men the prospect of so easy a method of getting rid of their children own that plutarch speaks of it as a very general maxim of the poor to expose their children and as the rich were then averse to marriage on account of the courtship they met with from those who expected legacies from them the public must have been in a bad situation between them of all sciences there is none where first appearances are more deceitful than in politics hospitals for foundlings seem favourable to the encrease of numbers and perhaps may be so when kept under proper restrictions but when they open the door to every one without distinction they have probably a contrary effect and are pernicious to the state it is computed that every ninth child born at paris is sent to the hospital though it seems certain according to the common course of human affairs that it is not a hundredth child whose parents are altogether incapacitated to rear and educate him the k great difference for health industry and morals between an education in an hospital and that in a private family should induce us not to make the entrance into the former too easy and engaging to kill ones own child is shocking to nature and must therefore be somewhat unusual but to turn over the care of him upon others is very tempting to the natural indolence of mankind having considered the domestic life and manners of the ancients compared to those of the moderns where in the main we seem rather superior so far as the present question is concerned we shall now examine the political customs and institutions of both ages and weigh their influence in retarding or forwarding the propagation of mankind before the encrease of the roman power or rather till its full establishment almost all the nations which are the scene of ancient history were divided into small territories or petty commonwealths where of course a great equality of fortune prevailed and the center of the government was always very near its frontiers this was the situation of affairs not only in greece and italy but also in spain gaul germany afric and a great part of the lesser asia and it must be owned that no institution could be more favourable to the propagation of mankind for though a man of an overgrown fortune not being able to consume more than another must share it with those who serve and attend him yet their possession being precarious they have not the same encouragement to marry as if each had a small fortune secure and independent enormous cities are besides destructive to society beget vice and disorder of all kinds starve the remoter provinces and even starve themselves by the prices to which they raise all provisions where each man had his little house and field to himself and each county had its capital free and independent what a happy situation of mankind how favourable to industry and agriculture to marriage and propagation the prolific virtue of men were it to act in its full extent without that restraint which poverty and necessity imposes on it would double the number every generation and nothing surely can give it more liberty than such small commonwealths and such an equality of fortune among the citizens all small states naturally produce equality of fortune because they afford no opportunities of great encrease but small commonwealths much more by that division of power and authority which is essential to them when xenophon returned after the famous expedition with cyrus he hired himself and of the greeks into the service of seuthes a prince of thrace and the articles of his agreement were that each soldier should receive a daric a month each captain two darics and he himself as general four a regulation of pay which would not a little surprise our modern officers demosthenes and æschines with eight more were sent ambassadors to philip of macedon and their appointments for above four months were a thousand drachmas which is less than a drachma a day for each ambassador but a drachma a day nay sometimes two was the pay of a common footsoldier a centurion among the romans had only double pay to a private man in polybiuss time and we accordingly find the gratuities after a triumph regulated by that proportion but mark anthony and the triumvirate gave the centurions five times the reward of the other so much had the encrease of the commonwealth encreased the inequality among the citizens it must be owned that the situation of affairs in modern times with regard to civil liberty as well as equality of fortune is not near so favourable either to the propagation or happiness of mankind europe is shared out mostly into great monarchies and such parts of it as are divided into small territories are commonly governed by absolute princes who ruin their people by a mimicry of the greater monarchs in the splendor of their court and number of their forces swisserland alone and holland resemble the ancient republics and though the former is far from possessing any advantage either of soil climate or commerce yet the numbers of people with which it abounds notwithstanding their enlisting themselves into every service in europe prove sufficiently the advantages of their political institutions the ancient republics derived their chief or only security from the numbers of their citizens the trachinians having lost great numbers of their people the remainder instead of enriching themselves by the inheritance of their fellowcitizens applied to sparta their metropolis for a new stock of inhabitants the spartans immediately collected ten thousand men among whom the old citizens divided the lands of which the former proprietors had perished after timoleon had banished dionysius from syracuse and had settled the affairs of sicily finding the cities of syracuse and sellinuntium extremely depopulated by tyranny war and faction he invited over from greece some new inhabitants to repeople them immediately forty thousand men plutarch says sixty thousand offered themselves and he distributed so many lots of land among them to the great satisfaction of the ancient inhabitants a proof at once of the maxims of ancient policy which affected populousness more than riches and of the good effects of these maxims in the extreme populousness of that small country greece which could at once supply so great a colony the case was not much different with the romans in early times he is a pernicious citizen said curius who cannot be content with seven acres such ideas of equality could not fail of producing great numbers of people we must now consider what disadvantages the ancients lay under with regard to populousness and what checks they received from their political maxims and institutions there are commonly compensations in every human condition and though these compensations be not always perfectly equal yet they serve at least to restrain the prevailing principle to compare them and estimate their influence is indeed difficult even where they take place in the same age and in neighbouring countries but where several ages have intervened and only scattered lights are afforded us by ancient authors what can we do but amuse ourselves by talking pro and con on an interesting subject and thereby correcting all hasty and violent determinations first we may observe that the ancient republics were almost in perpetual war a natural effect of their martial spirit their love of liberty their mutual emulation and that hatred which generally prevails among nations that live in close neighbourhood now war in a small state is much more destructive than in a great one both because all the inhabitants in the former case must serve in the armies and because the whole state is frontier and is all exposed to the inroads of the enemy the maxims of ancient war were much more destructive than those of modern chiefly by that distribution of plunder in which the soldiers were indulged the private men in our armies are such a low set of people that we find any abundance beyond their simple pay breeds confusion and disorder among them and a total dissolution of discipline the very wretchedness and meanness of those who fill the modern armies render them less destructive to the countries which they invade one instance among many of the deceitfulness of first appearances in all political reasonings ancient battles were much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employed in them the ancients drew up their men or sometimes men deep which made a narrow front and it was not difficult to find a field in which both armies might be marshalled and might engage with each other even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges hillocks woods or hollow ways the battle was not so soon decided between the contending parties but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties which opposed them and take part in the engagement and as the whole army was thus engaged and each man closely buckled to his antagonist the battles were commonly very bloody and great slaughter was made on both sides especially on the vanquished the long thin lines required by firearms and the quick decision of the fray render our modern engagements but partial rencounters and enable the general who is foiled in the beginning of the day to draw off the greater part of his army sound and entirel the battles of antiquity both by their duration and their resemblance to single combats were wrought up to a degree of fury quite unknown to later ages nothing could then engage the combatants to give quarter but the hopes of profit by making slaves of their prisoners in civil wars as we learn from tacitus the battles were the most bloody because the prisoners were not slaves what a stout resistance must be made where the vanquished expected so hard a fate how inveterate the rage where the maxims of war were in every respect so bloody and severe instances are frequent in ancient history of cities besieged whose inhabitants rather than open their gates murdered their wives and children and rushed themselves on a voluntary death sweetened perhaps by a little prospect of revenge upon the enemy greeks as well as barbarians have often been wrought up to this degree of fury and the same determined spirit and cruelty must in other instances less remarkable have been destructive to human society in those petty commonwealths which lived in close neighbourhood and were engaged in perpetual wars and contentions sometimes the wars in greece says plutarch were carried on entirely by inroads and robberies and piracies such a method of war must be more destructive in small states than the bloodiest battles and sieges by the laws of the twelve tables possession during two years formed a prescription for land one year for moveables an indication that there was not in italy at that time much more order tranquillity and settled police than there is at present among the tartars the only cartel remember in ancient history is that between demetrius poliorcetes and the rhodians when it was agreed that a free citizen should be restored for drachmas a slave bearing arms for but secondly it appears that ancient manners were more unfavourable than the modern not only in times of war but also in those of peace and that too in every respect except the love of civil liberty and of equality which is own of considerable importance to exclude faction from a free government is very difficult if not altogether impracticable but such inveterate rage between the factions and such bloody maxims are found in modern times amongst religious parties alonen in ancient history we may always observe where one party prevailed whether the nobles or people for can observe no difference in this respect that they immediately butchered all of the opposite party who fell into their hands and banished such as had been so fortunate as to escape their fury no form of process no law no trial no pardon a fourth a third perhaps near half of the city was slaughtered or expelled every revolution and the exiles always joined foreign enemies and did all the mischief possible to their fellowcitizens till fortune put it in their power to take full revenge by a new revolution and as these were frequent in such violent governments the disorder diffidence jealousy enmity which must prevail are not easy for us to imagine in this age of the world there are only two revolutions can recollect in ancient history which passed without great severity and great effusion of blood in massacres and assassinations namely the restoration of the athenian democracy by thrasybulus and the subduing of the roman republic by cæsar we learn from ancient history that thrasybulus passed a general amnesty for all past offences and first introduced that word as well as practice into greece it appears however from many orations of lysias that the chief and even some of the subaltern offenders in the preceding tyranny were tried and capitally punishedo and as to cæsars clemency though much celebrated it would not gain great applause in the present age he butchered for instance all catos senate when he became master of utica and these we may readily believe were not the most worthless of the party all those who had borne arms against that usurper were attainted and by hirtiuss law declared incapable of all public offices these people were extremely fond of liberty but seem not to have understood it very well when the thirty tyrants first established their dominion at athens they began with seizing all the sycophants and informers who had been so troublesome during the democracy and putting them to death by an arbitrary sentence and execution every man says sallust and lysiaswas rejoiced at these punishments not considering that liberty was from that moment annihilated the utmost energy of the nervous style of thucydides and the copiousness and expression of the greek language seem to sink under that historian when he attempts to describe the disorders which arose from faction throughout all the grecian commonwealths you would imagine that he still labours with a thought greater than he can find words to communicate and he concludes his pathetic description with an observation which is at once refined and solid in these contests says he those who were the dullest and most stupid and had the least foresight commonly prevailed for being conscious of this weakness and dreading to be overreached by those of greater penetration they went to work hastily without premeditation by the sword and poinard and thereby got the start of their antagonists who were forming fine schemes and projects for their destruction not to mention dionysius the elder who is computed to have butchered in cool blood above of his fellowcitizens or agathoclesnabis and others still more bloody than he the transactions even in free governments were extremely violent and destructive at athens the thirty tyrants and the nobles in a twelvemonth murdered without trial about of the people and banished above the half of the citizens that remained in argos near the same time the people killed of the nobles and afterwards their own demagogues because they had refused to carry their prosecutions farther the people also in corcyra killed of the nobles and banished a thousand these numbers will appear the more surprising if we consider the extreme smallness of these states but all ancient history is full of such instances when alexander ordered all the exiles to be restored throughout all the cities it was found that the whole amounted to men the remains probably of still greater slaughters and massacres what an astonishing multitude in so narrow a country as ancient greece and what domestic confusion jealousy partiality revenge heartburnings must tear those cities where factions were wrought up to such a degree of fury and despair it would be easier says isocrates to philip to raise an army in greece at present from the vagabonds than from the cities even when affairs came not to such extremities which they failed not to do almost in every city twice or thrice every century property was rendered very precarious by the maxims of ancient government xenophon in the banquet of socrates gives us a natural unaffected description of the tyranny of the athenian people in my poverty says charmides am much more happy than ever was while possessed of riches as much as it is happier to be in security than in terrors free than a slave to receive than to pay court to be trusted than suspected formerly was obliged to caress every informer some imposition was continually laid upon me and it was never allowed me to travel or be absent from the city at present when am poor look big and threaten others the rich are afraid of me and show me every kind of civility and respect and am become a kind of tyrant in the city in one of the pleadings of lysias the orator very coolly speaks of it by the by as a maxim of the athenian people that whenever they wanted money they put to death some of the rich citizens as well as strangers for the sake of the forfeiture in mentioning this he seems not to have any intention of blaming them still less of provoking them who were his audience and judges whether a man was a citizen or a stranger among that people it seems indeed requisite either that he should impoverish himself or that the people would impoverish him and perhaps kill him into the bargain the orator last mentioned gives a pleasant account of an estate laid out in the public service that is above the third of it in rareeshows and figured dances need not insist on the greek tyrannies which were altogether horrible even the mixed monarchies by which most of the ancient states of greece were governed before the introduction of republics were very unsettled scarcely any city but athens says isocrates could show a succession of kings for four or five generations besides many other obvious reasons for the instability of ancient monarchies the equal division of property among the brothers in private families must by a necessary consequence contribute to unsettle and disturb the state the universal preference given to the elder by modern laws though it encreases the inequality of fortunes has however this good effect that it accustoms men to the same idea in public succession and cuts off all claim and pretension of the younger the new settled colony of heraclea falling immediately into faction applied to sparta who sent heripidas with full authority to quiet their dissentions this man not provoked by any opposition not inflamed by party rage knew no better expedient than immediately putting to death about of the citizens a strong proof how deeply rooted these violent maxims of government were throughout all greece if such was the disposition of mens minds among that refined people what may be expected in the commonwealths of italy afric spain and gaul which were denominated barbarous why otherwise did the greeks so much value themselves on their humanity gentleness and moderation above all other nations this reasoning seems very natural but unluckily the history of the roman commonwealth in its earlier times if we give credit to the received accounts presents an opposite conclusion no blood was ever shed in any sedition at rome till the murder of the gracchi dionysius halicarnassæus observing the singular humanity of the roman people in this particular makes use of it as an argument that they were originally of grecian extraction whence we may conclude that the factions and revolutions in the barbarous republics were usually more violent than even those of greece abovementioned if the romans were so late in coming to blows they made ample compensation after they had once entered upon the bloody scene and appians history of their civil wars contains the most frightful picture of massacres proscriptions and forfeitures that ever was presented to the world what pleases most in that historian is that he seems to feel a proper resentment of these barbarous proceedings and talks not with that provoking coolness and indifference which custom had produced in many of the greek historians the maxims of ancient politics contain in general so little humanity and moderation that it seems superfluous to give any particular reason for the acts of violence committed at any particular period yet cannot forbear observing that the laws in the later period of the roman commonwealth were so absurdly contrived that they obliged the heads of parties to have recourse to these extremities all capital punishments were abolished however criminal or what is more however dangerous any citizen might be he could not regularly be punished otherwise than by banishment and it became necessary in the revolutions of party to draw the sword of private vengeance nor was it easy when laws were once violated to set bounds to these sanguinary proceedings had brutus himself prevailed over the triumvirate could he in common prudence have allowed octavius and anthony to live and have contented himself with banishing them to rhodes or marseilles where they might still have plotted new commotions and rebellions his executing antonius brother to the triumvir shows evidently his sense of the matter did not cicero with the approbation of all the wise and virtuous of rome arbitrarily put to death catilines accomplices contrary to law and without any trial or form of process and if he moderated his executions did it not proceed either from the clemency of his temper or the conjunctures of the times a wretched security in a government which pretends to laws and liberty thus one extreme produces another in the same manner as excessive severity in the laws is apt to beget great relaxation in their execution so their excessive lenity naturally produces cruelty and barbarity it is dangerous to force us in any case to pass their sacred boundaries one general cause of the disorders so frequent in all ancient governments seems to have consisted in the great difficulty of establishing any aristocracy in those ages and the perpetual discontents and seditions of the people whenever even the meanest and most beggarly were excluded from the legislature and from public offices the very quality of freemen gave such a rank being opposed to that of slave that it seemed to entitle the possessor to every power and privilege of the commonwealth solons laws excluded no freeman from votes or elections but confined some magistracies to a particular census yet were the people never satisfied till those laws were repealed by the treaty with antipater no athenian was allowed a vote whose census was less than drachmas about l sterling and though such a government would to us appear sufficiently democratical it was so disagreeable to that people that above twothirds of them immediately left their countrycassander reduced that census to the half yet still the government was considered as an oligarchical tyranny and the effect of foreign violence servius tulliuss laws seem equal and reasonable by fixing the power in proportion to the property yet the roman people could never be brought quietly to submit to them in those days there was no medium between a severe jealous aristocracy ruling over discontented subjects and a turbulent factious tyrannical democracyr at present there is not one republic in europe from one extremity of it to the other that is not remarkable for justice lenity and stability equal to or even beyond marseilles rhodes or the most celebrated in antiquity almost all of them are welltempered aristocracies but thirdly there are many other circumstances in which ancient nations seem inferior to the modern both for the happiness and encrease of mankind trade manufactures industry were no where in former ages so flourishing as they are at present in europe the only garb of the ancients both for males and females seems to have been a kind of flannel which they wore commonly white or grey and which they scoured as often as it became dirty tyre which carried on after carthage the greatest commerce of any city in the mediterranean before it was destroyed by alexander was no mighty city if we credit arrians account of its inhabitantsathens is commonly supposed to have been a trading city but it was as populous before the median war as at any time after it according to herodotus yet its commerce at that time was so inconsiderable that as the same historian observes even the neighbouring coasts of asia were as little frequented by the greeks as the pillars of hercules for beyond these he conceived nothing great interest of money and great profits of trade are an infallible indication that industry and commerce are but in their infancy we read in lysias of per cent profit made on a cargo of two talents sent to no greater distance than from athens to the adriatic nor is this mentioned as an instance of extraordinary profit antidorus says demosthenes paid three talents and a half for a house which he let at a talent a year and the orator blames his own tutors for not employing his money to like advantage my fortune says he in eleven years minority ought to have been tripled the value of of the slaves left by his father he computes at minas and the yearly profit of their labour at the most moderate interest at athens for there was higher often paid was per cent and that paid monthly not to insist upon the high interest to which the vast sums distributed in elections had raised money at rome we find that verres before that factious period stated per cent for money which he left in the hands of the publicans and though cicero exclaims against this article it is not on account of the extravagant usury but because it had never been customary to state any interest on such occasions interest indeed sunk at rome after the settlement of the empire but it never remained any considerable time so low as in the commercial states of modern times among the other inconveniencies which the athenians felt from the fortifying of decelia by the lacedemonians it is represented by thucydides as one of the most considerable that they could not bring over their corn from eubea by land passing by oropus but were obliged to embark it and to sail round the promontory of sunium a surprising instance of the imperfection of ancient navigation for the watercarriage is not here above double the land do not remember a passage in any ancient author where the growth of a city is ascribed to the establishment of a manufacture the commerce which is said to flourish is chiefly the exchange of those commodities for which different soils and climates were suited the sale of wine and oil into africa according to diodorus siculus was the foundation of the riches of agrigentum the situation of the city of sybaris according to the same author was the cause of its immense populousness being built near the two rivers crathys and sybaris but these two rivers we may observe are not navigable and could only produce some fertile vallies for agriculture and tillage an advantage so inconsiderable that a modern writer would scarcely have taken notice of it the barbarity of the ancient tyrants together with the extreme love of liberty which animated those ages must have banished every merchant and manufacturer and have quite depopulated the state had it subsisted upon industry and commerce while the cruel and suspicious dionysius was carrying on his butcheries who that was not detained by his landed property and could have carried with him any art or skill to procure a subsistence in other countries would have remained exposed to such implacable barbarity the persecutions of philip and lewis filled all europe with the manufacturers of flanders and of france grant that agriculture is the species of industry chiefly requisite to the subsistence of multitudes and it is possible that this industry may flourish even where manufactures and other arts are unknown and neglected swisserland is at present a remarkable instance where we find at once the most skilful husbandmen and the most bungling tradesmen that are to be met with in europe that agriculture flourished in greece and italy at least in some parts of them and at some periods we have reason to presume and whether the mechanical arts had reached the same degree of perfection may not be esteemed so material especially if we consider the great equality of riches in the ancient republics where each family was obliged to cultivate with the greatest care and industry its own little field in order to its subsistence but is it just reasoning because agriculture may in some instances flourish without trade or manufactures to conclude that in any great extent of country and for any great tract of time it would subsist alone the most natural way surely of encouraging husbandry is first to excite other kinds of industry and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoyment this method is infallible and universal and as it prevails more in modern government than in the ancient it affords a presumption of the superior populousness of the former every man says xenophon may be a farmer no art or skill is requisite all consists in industry and in attention to the execution a strong proof as columella hints that agriculture was but little known in the age of xenophon all our later improvements and refinements have they done nothing towards the easy subsistence of men and consequently towards their propagation and encrease our superior skill in mechanics the discovery of new worlds by which commerce has been so much enlarged the establishment of posts and the use of bills of exchange these seem all extremely useful to the encouragement of art industry and populousness were we to strike off these what a check should we give to every kind of business and labour and what multitudes of families would immediately perish from want and hunger and it seems not probable that we could supply the place of these new inventions by any other regulation or institution have we reason to think that the police of ancient states was any wise comparable to that of modern or that men had then equal security either at home or in their journies by land or water question not but every impartial examiner would give us the preference in this particular thus upon comparing the whole it seems impossible to assign any just reason why the world should have been more populous in ancient than in modern times the equality of property among the ancients liberty and the small divisions of their states were indeed circumstances favourable to the propagation of mankind but their wars were more bloody and destructive their governments more factious and unsettled commerce and manufactures more feeble and languishing and the general police more loose and irregular these latter disadvantages seem to form a sufficient counterbalance to the former advantages and rather favour the opposite opinion to that which commonly prevails with regard to this subject but there is no reasoning it may be said against matter of fact if it appear that the world was then more populous than at present we may be assured that our conjectures are false and that we have overlooked some material circumstance in the comparison this readily own all our preceding reasonings acknowledge to be mere trifling or at least small skirmishes and frivolous rencounters which decide nothing but unluckily the main combat where we compare facts cannot be rendered much more decisive the facts delivered by ancient authors are either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us nothing positive in this matter how indeed could it be otherwise the very facts which we must oppose to them in computing the populousness of modern states are far from being either certain or complete many grounds of calculation proceeded on by celebrated writers are little better than those of the emperor heliogabalus who formed an estimate of the immense greatness of rome from ten thousand pound weight of cobwebs which had been found in that city it is to be remarked that all kinds of numbers are uncertain in ancient manuscripts and have been subject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text and that for an obvious reason any alteration in other places commonly affects the sense or grammar and is more readily perceived by the reader and transcriber few enumerations of inhabitants have been made of any tract of country by any ancient author of good authority so as to afford us a large enough view for comparison it is probable that there was formerly a good foundation for the number of citizens assigned to any free city because they entered for a share in the government and there were exact registers kept of them but as the number of slaves is seldom mentioned this leaves us in as great uncertainty as ever with regard to the populousness even of single cities the first page of thucydides is in my opinion the commencement of real history all preceding narrations are so intermixed with fable that philosophers ought to abandon them in a great measure to the embellishment of poets and orators with regard to remote times the numbers of people assigned are often ridiculous and lose all credit and authority the free citizens of sybaris able to bear arms and actually drawn out in battle were they encountered at siagra with citizens of crotona another greek city contiguous to them and were defeated this is diodorus siculuss account and is very seriously insisted on by that historian strabo also mentions the same number of sybarites diodorus siculus enumerating the inhabitants of agrigentum when it was destroyed by the carthaginians says that they amounted to citizens strangers besides slaves who in so opulent a city as he represents it would probably be at least as numerous we must remark that the women and the children are not included and that therefore upon the whole this city must have contained near two millions of inhabitants and what was the reason of so immense an encrease they were industrious in cultivating the neighbouring fields not exceeding a small english county and they traded with their wine and oil to africa which at that time produced none of these commodities ptolemy says theocritus commands cities suppose the singularity of the number was the reason of assigning it diodorus siculus assigns three millions of inhabitants to ægypt a small number but then he makes the number of cities amount to an evident contradiction he says the people were formerly seven millions thus remote times are always most envied and admired that xerxess army was extremely numerous can readily believe both from the great extent of his empire and from the practice among the eastern nations of encumbering their camp with a superfluous multitude but will any rational man cite herodotuss wonderful narrations as an authority there is something very rational own in lysiass argument upon this subject had not xerxess army been incredibly numerous says he he had never made a bridge over the hellespont it had been much easier to have transported his men over so short a passage with the numerous shipping of which he was master polybius says that the romans between the first and second punic wars being threatened with an invasion from the gauls mustered all their own forces and those of their allies and found them amount to seven hundred thousand men able to bear arms a great number surely and which when joined to the slaves is probablys not less if not rather more than that extent of country affords at present the enumeration too seems to have been made with some exactness and polybius gives us the detail of the particulars but might not the number be magnified in order to encourage the people diodorus siculus makes the same enumeration amount to near a million these variations are suspicious he plainly too supposes that italy in his time was not so populous another suspicious circumstance for who can believe that the inhabitants of that country diminished from the time of the first punic war to that of the triumvirates julius cæsar according to appian encountered four millions of gauls killed one million and made another million prisoners supposing the number of the enemys army and that of the slain could be exactly assigned which never is possible how could it be known how often the same man returned into the armies or how distinguish the new from the old levied soldiers no attention ought ever to be given to such loose exaggerated calculations especially where the author does not tell us the mediums upon which the calculations were founded paterculus makes the number of gauls killed by cæsar amount only to a more probable account and more easily reconciled to the history of these wars given by that conqueror himself in his commentariesv the most bloody of his battles were fought against the helvetii and the germans one would imagine that every circumstance of the life and actions of dionysius the elder might be regarded as authentic and free from all fabulous exaggeration both because he lived at a time when letters flourished most in greece and because his chief historian was philistus a man allowed to be of great genius and who was a courtier and minister of that prince but can we admit that he had a standing army of foot horse and a fleet of gallies these we may observe were mercenary forces and subsisted upon pay like our armies in europe for the citizens were all disarmed and when dion afterwards invaded sicily and called on his countrymen to vindicate their liberty he was obliged to bring arms along with him which he distributed among those who joined him in a state where agriculture alone flourishes there may be many inhabitants and if these be all armed and disciplined a great force may be called out upon occasion but great bodies of mercenary troops can never be maintained without either great trade and numerous manufactures or extensive dominions the united provinces never were masters of such a force by sea and land as that which is said to belong to dionysius yet they possess as large a territory perfectly well cultivated and have much more resources from their commerce and industry diodorus siculus allows that even in his time the army of dionysius appeared incredible that is as interpret it was entirely a fiction and the opinion arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himselfw it is a usual fallacy to consider all the ages of antiquity as one period and to compute the numbers contained in the great cities mentioned by ancient authors as if these cities had been all cotemporary the greek colonies flourished extremely in sicily during the age of alexander but in augustuss time they were so decayed that almost all the produce of that fertile island was consumed in italy let us now examine the numbers of inhabitants assigned to particular cities in antiquity and omitting the numbers of nineveh babylon and the egyptian thebes let us confine ourselves to the sphere of real history to the grecian and roman states must own the more consider this subject the more am inclined to scepticism with regard to the great populousness ascribed to ancient times athens is said by plato to be a very great city and it was surely the greatest of all the greek cities except syracuse which was nearly about the same size in thucydidess time and afterwards encreased beyond it for cicero mentions it as the greatest of all the greek cities in his time not comprehending suppose either antioch or alexandria under that denomination athenæus says that by the enumeration of demetrius phalereus there were in athens citizens strangers and slaves this number is much insisted on by those whose opinion call in question and is esteemed a fundamental fact to their purpose but in my opinion there is no point of criticism more certain than that athenæus and ctesicles whom he quotes are here mistaken and that the number of slaves is at least augmented by a whole cypher and ought not to be regarded as more than first when the number of citizens is said to be by athenæus men of full age are only understood for herodotus says that aristagoras ambassador from the ionians found it harder to deceive one spartan than athenians meaning in a loose way the whole state supposed to be met in one popular assembly excluding the women and children thucydides says that making allowance for all the absentees in the fleet army garrisons and for people employed in their private affairs the athenian assembly never rose to five thousand the forces enumerated by the same historian being all citizens and amounting to heavyarmed infantry prove the same method of calculation as also the whole tenor of the greek historians who always understand men of full age when they assign the number of citizens in any republic now these being but the fourth of the inhabitants the free athenians were by this account the strangers and the slaves calculating by the smaller number and allowing that they married and propagated at the same rate with freemen were and the whole of the inhabitants a number surely large enough the other number makes athens larger than london and paris united secondly there were but houses in athens thirdly though the extent of the walls as given us by thucydides be great to wit eighteen miles beside the seacoast yet xenophon says there was much waste ground within the walls they seem indeed to have joined four distinct and separate cities fourthly no insurrection of the slaves or suspicion of insurrection is ever mentioned by historians except one commotion of the miners fifthly the treatment of slaves by the athenians is said by xenophon and demosthenes and plautus to have been extremely gentle and indulgent which could never have been the case had the disproportion been twenty to one the disproportion is not so great in any of our colonies yet are we obliged to exercise a rigorous military government over the negroes sixthly no man is ever esteemed rich for possessing what may be reckoned an equal distribution of property in any country or even triple or quadruple that wealth thus every person in england is computed by some to spend sixpence a day yet is he esteemed but poor who has five times that sum now timarchus is said by æschines to have been left in easy circumstances but he was master only of ten slaves employed in manufactures lysias and his brother two strangers were proscribed by the thirty for their great riches though they had but sixty apiecedemosthenes was left very rich by his father yet he had no more than fiftytwo slaves his workhouse of twenty cabinetmakers is said to be a very considerable manufactory seventhly during the decelian war as the greek historians call it slaves deserted and brought the athenians to great distress as we learn from thucydides this could not have happened had they been only the twentieth part the best slaves would not desert eighthlyxenophon proposes a scheme for maintaining by the public slaves and that so great a number may possibly be supported any one will be convinced says he who considers the numbers we possessed before the decelian war a way of speaking altogether incompatible with the larger number of athenæus ninthly the whole census of the state of athens was less than talents and though numbers in ancient manuscripts be often suspected by critics yet this is unexceptionable both because demosthenes who gives it gives also the detail which checks him and because polybius assigns the same number and reasons upon it now the most vulgar slave could yield by his labour an obolus a day over and above his maintenance as we learn from xenophon who says that niciass overseer paid his master so much for slaves whom he employed inx mines if you will take the pains to estimate an obolus a day and the slaves at computing only at four years purchase you will find the sum above talents even though allowance be made for the great number of holidays in athens besides many of the slaves would have a much greater value from their art the lowest that demosthenes estimates any of his fathers slaves is two minas a head and upon this supposition it is a little difficult confess to reconcile even the number of slaves with the census of talents tenthlychios is said by thucydides to contain more slaves than any greek city except sparta sparta then had more than athens in proportion to the number of citizens the spartans were in the town in the country the male slaves therefore of full age must have been more than the whole more than a number impossible to be maintained in a narrow barren country such as laconia which had no trade had the helotes been so very numerous the murder of mentioned by thucydides would have irritated them without weakening them besides we are to consider that the number assigned by athenæus whatever it is comprehends all the inhabitants of attica as well as those of athens the athenians affected much a country life as we learn from thucydides and when they were all chased into town by the invasion of their territory during the peloponnesian war the city was not able to contain them and they were obliged to lie in the porticoes temples and even streets for want of lodging the same remark is to be extended to all the other greek cities and when the number of citizens is assigned we must always understand it to comprehend the inhabitants of the neighbouring country as well as of the city yet even with this allowance it must be confessed that greece was a populous country and exceeded what we could imagine concerning so narrow a territory naturally not very fertile and which drew no supplies of corn from other places for excepting athens which traded to pontus for that commodity the other cities seem to have subsisted chiefly from their neighbouring territory rhodes is well known to have been a city of extensive commerce and of great fame and splendor yet it contained only citizens able to bear arms when it was besieged by demetrius thebes was always one of the capital cities of greece but the number of its citizens exceeded not those of rhodesphliasia is said to be a small city by xenophon yet we find that it contained citizens pretend not to reconcile these two factsaa perhaps xenophon calls phliasia a small town because it made but a small figure in greece and maintained only a subordinate alliance with sparta or perhaps the country belonging to it was extensive and most of the citizens were employed in the cultivation of it and dwelt in the neighbouring villages mantinea was equal to any city in arcadia consequently it was equal to megalopolis which was fifty stadia or six miles and a quarter in circumference but mantinea had only citizens the greek cities therefore contained often fields and gardens together with the houses and we cannot judge of them by the extent of their walls athens contained no more than houses yet its walls with the seacoast were above twenty miles in extent syracuse was twentytwo miles in circumference yet was scarcely ever spoken of by the ancients as more populous than athens babylon was a square of fifteen miles or sixty miles in circuit but it contained large cultivated fields and inclosures as we learn from pliny though aurelians wall was fifty miles in circumference the circuit of all the thirteen divisions of rome taken apart according to publius victor was only about fortythree miles when an enemy invaded the country all the inhabitants retired within the walls of the ancient cities with their cattle and furniture and instruments of husbandry and the great height to which the walls were raised enabled a small number to defend them with facility sparta says xenophon is one of the cities of greece that has the fewest inhabitants yet polybius says that it was fortyeight stadia in circumference and was round all the ætolians able to bear arms in antipaters time bb deducting some few garrisons were but ten thousand men polybius tells us that the achæan league might without any inconvenience march or men and this account seems probable for that league comprehended the greater part of peloponnesus yet pausanias speaking of the same period says that all the achæans able to bear arms even when several manumitted slaves were joined to them did not amount to fifteen thousand the thessalians till their final conquest by the romans were in all ages turbulent factious seditious disorderly it is not therefore natural to suppose that this part of greece abounded much in people cc we are told by thucydides that the part of peloponnesus adjoining to pylos was desart and uncultivated herodotus says that macedonia was full of lions and wild bulls animals which can only inhabit vast unpeopled forests these were the two extremities of greece all the inhabitants of epirus of all ages sexes and conditions who were sold by paulus æmilius amounted only to yet epirus might be double the extent of yorkshiredd eejustin tells us that when philip of macedon was declared head of the greek confederacy he called a congress of all the states except the lacedemonians who refused to concur and he found the force of the whole upon computation to amount to infantry and cavalry this must be understood to be all the citizens capable of bearing arms for as the greek republics maintained no mercenary forces and had no militia distinct from the whole body of the citizens it is not conceivable what other medium there could be of computation that such an army could ever by greece be brought into the field and be maintained there is contrary to all history upon this supposition therefore we may thus reason the free greeks of all ages and sexes were the slaves estimating them by the number of athenian slaves as above who seldom married or had families were double the male citizens of full age to wit and all the inhabitants of ancient greece excepting laconia were about one million two hundred and ninety thousand no mighty number nor exceeding what may be found at present in scotland a country of not much greater extent and very indifferently peopled we may now consider the numbers of people in rome and italy and collect all the lights afforded us by scattered passages in ancient authors we shall find upon the whole a great difficulty in fixing any opinion on that head and no reason to support those exaggerated calculations so much insisted on by modern writers dionysius halicarnassæus says that the ancient walls of rome were nearly of the same compass with those of athens but that the suburbs ran out to a great extent and it was difficult to tell where the town ended or the country began in some places of rome it appears from the same author from juvenal and from other ancient writers that the houses were high and families lived in separate storeys one above another but it is probable that these were only the poorer citizens and only in some few streets if we may judge from the younger plinys account of his own house and from bartolis plans of ancient buildings the men of quality had very spacious palaces and their buildings were like the chinese houses at this day where each apartment is separated from the rest and rises no higher than a single storey to which if we add that the roman nobility much affected extensive porticoes and even woods in town we may perhaps allow vossius though there is no manner of reason for it to read the famous passage of the elder pliny his own way without admitting the extravagant consequences which he draws from it the number of citizens who received corn by the public distribution in the time of augustus were two hundred thousand this one would esteem a pretty certain ground of calculation yet is it attended with such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and uncertainty did the poorer citizens only receive the distribution it was calculated to be sure chiefly for their benefit but it appears from a passage in cicero that the rich might also take their portion and that it was esteemed no reproach in them to apply for it to whom was the corn given whether only to heads of families or to every man woman and child the portion every month was five modii to each about of a bushel this was too little for a family and too much for an individual a very accurate antiquary therefore infers that it was given to every man of full age but he allows the matter to be uncertain was it strictly enquired whether the claimant lived within the precincts of rome or was it sufficient that he presented himself at the monthly distribution this last seems more probable were there no false claimants we are told that cæsar struck off at once who had creeped in without a just title and it is very little probable that he remedied all abuses but lastly what proportion of slaves must we assign to these citizens this is the most material question and the most uncertain it is very doubtful whether athens can be established as a rule for rome perhaps the athenians had more slaves because they employed them in manufactures for which a capital city like rome seems not so proper perhaps on the other hand the romans had more slaves on account of their superior luxury and riches there were exact bills of mortality kept at rome but no ancient author has given us the number of burials except suetonius who tells us that in one season there were names carried to the temple of libitina but this was during a plague which can afford no certain foundation for any inference the public corn though distributed only to citizens affected very considerably the whole agriculture of italy a fact no wise reconcileable to some modern exaggerations with regard to the inhabitants of that country the best ground of conjecture can find concerning the greatness of ancient rome is this we are told by herodian that antioch and alexandria were very little inferior to rome it appears from diodorus siculus that one straight street of alexandria reaching from gate to gate was five miles long and as alexandria was much more extended in length than breadth it seems to have been a city nearly of the bulk of paris and rome might be about the size of london there lived in alexandria in diodorus siculuss time free people comprehending suppose women and children but what number of slaves had we any just ground to fix these at an equal number with the free inhabitants it would favour the foregoing computation there is a passage in herodian which is a little surprising he says positively that the palace of the emperor was as large as all the rest of the city this was neros golden house which is indeed represented by suetonius and pliny as of an enormous extent but no power of imagination can make us conceive it to bear any proportion to such a city as london we may observe had the historian been relating neros extravagance and had he made use of such an expression it would have had much less weight these rhetorical exaggerations being so apt to creep into an authors style even when the most chaste and correct but it is mentioned by herodian only by the by in relating the quarrels between geta and caracalla it appears from the same historian that there was then much land uncultivated and put to no manner of use and he ascribes it as a great praise to pertinax that he allowed every one to take such land either in italy or elsewhere and cultivate it as he pleased without paying any taxes lands uncultivated and put to no manner of use this is not heard of in any part of christendom except in some remote parts of hungary as have been informed and it surely corresponds very ill with that idea of the extreme populousness of antiquity so much insisted on we learn from vopiscus that there was even in etruria much fertile land uncultivated which the emperor aurelian intended to convert into vineyards in order to furnish the roman people with a gratuitous distribution of wine a very proper expedient for depopulating still farther that capital and all the neighbouring territories it may not be amiss to take notice of the account which polybius gives of the great herds of swine to be met with in tuscany and lombardy as well as in greece and of the method of feeding them which was then practised there are great herds of swine says he throughout all italy particularly in former times through etruria and cisalpine gaul and a herd frequently consists of a thousand or more swine when one of these herds in feeding meets with another they mix together and the swineherds have no other expedient for separating them than to go to different quarters where they sound their horn and these animals being accustomed to that signal run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper whereas in greece if the herds of swine happen to mix in the forests he who has the greater flock takes cunningly the opportunity of driving all away and thieves are very apt to purloin the straggling hogs which have wandered to a great distance from their keeper in search of food may we not infer from this account that the north of italy as well as greece was then much less peopled and worse cultivated than at present how could these vast herds be fed in a country so full of inclosures so improved by agriculture so divided by farms so planted with vines and corn intermingled together must confess that polybiuss relation has more the air of that œconomy which is to be met with in our american colonies than the management of a european country we meet with a reflection in aristotles ethics which seems unaccountable on any supposition and by proving too much in favour of our present reasoning may be thought really to prove nothing that philosopher treating of friendship and observing that this relation ought neither to be contracted to a very few nor extended over a great multitude illustrates his opinion by the following argument in like manner says he as a city cannot subsist if it either have so few inhabitants as ten or so many as a hundred thousand so is there a mediocrity required in the number of friends and you destroy the essence of friendship by running into either extreme what impossible that a city can contain a hundred thousand inhabitants had aristotle never seen nor heard of a city so populous this must own passes my comprehension pliny tells us that seleucia the seat of the greek empire in the east was reported to contain people carthage is said by strabo to have contained the inhabitants of pekin are not much more numerous london paris and constantinople may admit of nearly the same computation at least the two latter cities do not exceed it rome alexandria antioch we have already spoken of from the experience of past and present ages one might conjecture that there is a kind of impossibility that any city could ever rise much beyond this proportion whether the grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on empire there seem to be invincible obstacles which prevent its farther progress the seats of vast monarchies by introducing extravagant luxury irregular expence idleness dependence and false ideas of rank and superiority are improper for commerce extensive commerce checks itself by raising the price of all labour and commodities when a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility possessed of overgrown fortunes the middling gentry remain in their provincial towns where they can make a figure on a moderate income and if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size there necessarily arise many capitals in the remoter provinces whither all the inhabitants except a few courtiers repair for education fortune and amusementlondon by uniting extensive commerce and middling empire has perhaps arrived at a greatness which no city will ever be able to exceed chuse dover or calais for a center draw a circle of two hundred miles radius you comprehend london paris the netherlands the united provinces and some of the best cultivated parts of france and england it may safely think be affirmed that no spot of ground can be found in antiquity of equal extent which contained near so many great and populous cities and was so stocked with riches and inhabitants to balance in both periods the states which possessed most art knowledge civility and the best police seems the truest method of comparison it is an observation of labbe du bos that italy is warmer at present than it was in ancient times the annals of rome tell us says he that in the year ab uc the winter was so severe that it destroyed the trees the tyber froze in rome and the ground was covered with snow for forty days when juvenal describes a superstitious woman he represents her as breaking the ice of the tyber that she might perform her ablutions hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem ter matutino tyberi mergetur he speaks of that rivers freezing as a common event many passages of horace suppose the streets of rome full of snow and ice we should have more certainty with regard to this point had the ancients known the use of thermometers but their writers without intending it give us information sufficient to convince us that the winters are now much more temperate at rome than formerly at present the tyber no more freezes at rome than the nile at cairo the romans esteem the winters very rigorous if the snow lie two days and if one see for eight and forty hours a few icicles hang from a fountain that has a north exposure the observation of this ingenious critic may be extended to other european climates who could discover the mild climate of france in diodorus siculuss description of that of gaul as it is a northern climate says he it is infested with cold to an extreme degree in cloudy weather instead of rain there fall great snows and in clear weather it there freezes so excessive hard that the rivers acquire bridges of their own substance over which not only single travellers may pass but large armies accompanied with all their baggage and loaded waggons and there being many rivers in gaul the rhone the rhine c almost all of them are frozen over and it is usual in order to prevent falling to cover the ice with chaff and straw at the places where the road passes ffcolder than agallicwinter is used by petronius as a proverbial expression aristotle says that gaul is so cold a climate that an ass could not live in it north of the cevennes says strabogaul produces not figs and olives and the vines which have been planted bear not grapes that will ripen ovid positively maintains with all the serious affirmation of prose that the euxine sea was frozen over every winter in his time and he appeals to roman governours whom he names for the truth of his assertion this seldom or never happens at present in the latitude of tomi whither ovid was banished all the complaints of the same poet seem to mark a rigour of the seasons which is scarcely experienced at present in petersburgh or stockholm tournefort a provençal who had travelled into the same country observes that there is not a finer climate in the world and he asserts that nothing but ovids melancholy could have given him such dismal ideas of it but the facts mentioned by that poet are too circumstantial to bear any such interpretation polybius says that the climate in arcadia was very cold and the air moist italy says varro is the most temperate climate in europe the inland parts gaul germany and pannonia no doubt have almost perpetual winter the northern parts of spain according to strabo are but ill inhabited because of the great cold allowing therefore this remark to be just that europe is become warmer than formerly how can we account for it plainly by no other method than by supposing that the land is at present much better cultivated and that the woods are cleared which formerly threw a shade upon the earth and kept the rays of the sun from penetrating to it our northern colonies in america become more temperate in proportion as the woods are felled but in general every one may remark that cold is still much more severely felt both in north and south america than in places under the same latitude in europe saserna quoted by columella affirmed that the disposition of the heavens was altered before his time and that the air had become much milder and warmer as appears hence says he that many places now abound with vineyards and olive plantations which formerly by reason of the rigour of the climate could raise none of these productions such a change if real will be allowed an evident sign of the better cultivation and peopling of countries before the age of saserna and if it be continued to the present times is a proof that these advantages have been continually encreasing throughout this part of the world let us now cast our eye over all the countries which are the scene of ancient and modern history and compare their past and present situation we shall not perhaps find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world ægypt is represented by maillet to whom we owe the best account of it as extremely populous though he esteems the number of its inhabitants to be diminished syria and the lesser asia as well as the coast of barbary can readily own to be desart in comparison of their ancient condition the depopulation of greece is also obvious but whether the country now called turky in europe may not in general contain more inhabitants than during the flourishing period of greece may be a little doubtful the thracians seem then to have lived like the tartars at present by pasturage and plunder the getes were still more uncivilized and the illyrians were no better these occupy ninetenths of that country and though the government of the turks be not very favourable to industry and propagation yet it preserves at least peace and order among the inhabitants and is preferable to that barbarous unsettled condition in which they anciently lived poland and muscovy in europe are not populous but are certainly much more so than the ancient sarmatia and scythia where no husbandry or tillage was ever heard of and pasturage was the sole art by which the people were maintained the like observation may be extended to denmark and sweden no one ought to esteem the immense swarms of people which formerly came from the north and overran all europe to be any objection to this opinion where a whole nation or even half of it remove their seat it is easy to imagine what a prodigious multitude they must form with what desperate valour they must make their attacks and how the terror they strike into the invaded nations will make these magnify in their imagination both the courage and multitude of the invaders scotland is neither extensive nor populous but were the half of its inhabitants to seek new seats they would form a colony as numerous as the teutons and cimbri and would shake all europe supposing it in no better condition for defence than formerly germany has surely at present twenty times more inhabitants than in ancient times when they cultivated no ground and each tribe valued itself on the extensive desolation which it spread around as we learn from cæsar and tacitus and strabo a proof that the division into small republics will not alone render a nation populous unless attended with the spirit of peace order and industry the barbarous condition of britain in former times is well known and the thinness of its inhabitants may easily be conjectured both from their barbarity and from a circumstance mentioned by herodian that all britain was marshy even in severuss time after the romans had been fully settled in it above a century it is not easily imagined that the gauls were anciently much more advanced in the arts of life than their northern neighbours since they travelled to this island for their education in the mysteries of the religion and philosophy of the druids cannot therefore think that gaul was then near so populous as france is at present were we to believe indeed and join together the testimony of appian and that of diodorus siculus we must admit of an incredible populousness in gaul the former historian says that there were nations in that country the latter affirms that the largest of the gallic nations consisted of men besides women and children and the least of calculating therefore at a medium we must admit of near millions of people in a country which we esteem populous at present though supposed to contain little more than twenty such calculations therefore by their extravagance lose all manner of authority we may observe that the equality of property to which the populousness of antiquity may be ascribed had no place among the gauls their intestine wars also before cæsars time were almost perpetual and strabo observes that though all gaul was cultivated yet was it not cultivated with any skill or care the genius of the inhabitants leading them less to arts than arms till their slavery under rome produced peace among themselves cæsar enumerates very particularly the great forces which were levied in belgium to oppose his conquests and makes them amount to these were not the whole people able to bear arms for the same historian tells us that the bellovaci could have brought a hundred thousand men into the field though they engaged only for sixty taking the whole therefore in this proportion of ten to six gg the sum of fighting men in all the states of belgium was about all the inhabitants a million and a half and belgium being about a fourth of gaul that country might contain six millions which is nothh near the third of its present inhabitantsjj we are informed by cæsar that the gauls had no fixed property in land but that the chieftains when any death happened in a family made a new division of all the lands among the several members of the family this is the custom of tanistry which so long prevailed in ireland and which retained that country in a state of misery barbarism and desolation the ancient helvetia was miles in length and in breadth according to the same author yet contained only inhabitants the canton of berne alone has at present as many people after this computation of appian and diodorus siculus know not whether dare affirm that the modern dutch are more numerous than the ancient batavi spain is perhaps decayed from what it was three centuries ago but if we step backward two thousand years and consider the restless turbulent unsettled condition of its inhabitants we may probably be inclined to think that it is now much more populous many spaniards killed themselves when deprived of their arms by the romans it appears from plutarch that robbery and plunder were esteemed honourable among the spaniards hirtius represents in the same light the situation of that country in cæsars time and he says that every man was obliged to live in castles and walled towns for his security it was not till its final conquest under augustus that these disorders were repressed the account which strabo and justin give of spain corresponds exactly with those above mentioned how much therefore must it diminish from our idea of the populousness of antiquity when we find that tully comparing italy afric gaul greece and spain mentions the great number of inhabitants as the peculiar circumstance which rendered this latter country formidable italy however it is probable has decayed but how many great cities does it still contain venice genoa pavia turin milan naples florence leghorn which either subsisted not in ancient times or were then very inconsiderable if we reflect on this we shall not be apt to carry matters to so great an extreme as is usual with regard to this subject when the roman authors complain that italy which formerly exported corn became dependent on all the provinces for its daily bread they never ascribe this alteration to the encrease of its inhabitants but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture a natural effect of that pernicious practice of importing corn in order to distribute it gratis among the roman citizens and a very bad means of multiplying the inhabitants of any country the sportula so much talked of by martial and juvenal being presents regularly made by the great lords to their smaller clients must have had a like tendency to produce idleness debauchery and a continual decay among the people the parishrates have at present the same bad consequences in england were to assign a period when imagine this part of the world might possibly contain more inhabitants than at present should pitch upon the age of trajan and the antonines the great extent of the roman empire being then civilized and cultivated settled almost in a profound peace both foreign and domestic and living under the same regular police and government but we are told that all extensive governments especially absolute monarchies are pernicious to population and contain a secret vice and poison which destroy the effect of all these promising appearances to confirm this there is a passage cited from plutarch which being somewhat singular we shall here examine it that author endeavouring to account for the silence of many of the oracles says that it may be ascribed to the present desolation of the world proceeding from former wars and factions which common calamity he adds has fallen heavier upon greece than on any other country insomuch that the whole could scarcely at present furnish three thousand warriors a number which in the time of the median war were supplied by the single city of megara the gods therefore who affect works of dignity and importance have suppressed many of their oracles and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people must confess that this passage contains so many difficulties that know not what to make of it you may observe that plutarch assigns for a cause of the decay of mankind not the extensive dominion of the romans but the former wars and factions of the several states all which were quieted by the roman arms plutarchs reasoning therefore is directly contrary to the inference which is drawn from the fact he advances polybius supposes that greece had become more prosperous and flourishing after the establishment of the roman yoke and though that historian wrote before these conquerors had degenerated from being the patrons to be the plunderers of mankind yet as we find from tacitus that the severity of the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the governors we have no reason to think that extensive monarchy so destructive as it is often represented we learn from strabo that the romans from their regard to the greeks maintained to his time most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated nation and nero afterwards rather encreased them how therefore can we imagine that the roman yoke was so burdensome over that part of the world the oppression of the proconsuls was checked and the magistracies in greece being all bestowed in the several cities by the free votes of the people there was no necessity for the competitors to attend the emperors court if great numbers went to seek their fortunes in rome and advance themselves by learning or eloquence the commodities of their native country many of them would return with the fortunes which they had acquired and thereby enrich the grecian commonwealths but plutarch says that the general depopulation had been more sensibly felt in greece than in any other country how is this reconcileable to its superior privileges and advantages besides this passage by proving too much really proves nothing only three thousand men able to bear arms in allgreece who can admit so strange a proposition especially if we consider the great number of greek cities whose names still remain in history and which are mentioned by writers long after the age of plutarch there are there surely ten times more people at present when there scarcely remains a city in all the bounds of ancient greece that country is still tolerably cultivated and furnishes a sure supply of corn in case of any scarcity in spain italy or the south of france we may observe that the ancient frugality of the greeks and their equality of property still subsisted during the age of plutarch as appears from lucian nor is there any ground to imagine that that country was possessed by a few masters and a great number of slaves it is probable indeed that military discipline being entirely useless was extremely neglected in greece after the establishment of the roman empire and if these commonwealths formerly so warlike and ambitious maintained each of them a small cityguard to prevent mobbish disorders it is all they had occasion for and these perhaps did not amount to men throughout all greece own that if plutarch had this fact in his eye he is here guilty of a gross paralogism and assigns causes no wise proportioned to the effects but is it so great a prodigy that an author should fall into a mistake of this nature but whatever force may remain in this passage of plutarch we shall endeavour to counterbalance it by as remarkable a passage in diodorus siculus where the historian after mentioning ninuss army of foot and horse endeavours to support the credibility of this account by some posterior facts and adds that we must not form a notion of the ancient populousness of mankind from the present emptiness and depopulation which is spread over the world thus an author who lived at that very period of antiquity which is represented as most populous complains of the desolation which then prevailed gives the preference to former times and has recourse to ancient fables as a foundation for his opinion the humour of blaming the present and admiring the past is strongly rooted in human nature and has an influence even on persons endued with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learning essay of the original contract as no party in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annexed to its political or practical one we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation is divided has reared up a fabric of the former kind in order to protect and cover that scheme of actions which it pursues the people being commonly very rude builders especially in this speculative way and more especially still when actuated by partyzeal it is natural to imagine that their workmanship must be a little unshapely and discover evident marks of that violence and hurry in which it was raised the one party by tracing up government to the deity endeavour to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege however tyrannical it may become to touch or invade it in the smallest article the other party by founding government altogether on the consent of the people suppose that there is a kind of original contract by which the subjects have tacitly reserved the power of resisting their sovereign whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority with which they have for certain purposes voluntarily entrusted him these are the speculative principles of the two parties and these too are the practical consequences deduced from them shall venture to affirm that both these systems of speculative principles are just though not in the sense intended by the parties and that both the schemes of practical consequences are prudent though not in the extremes to which each party in opposition to the other has commonly endeavoured to carry them that the deity is the ultimate author of all government will never be denied by any who admit a general providence and allow that all events in the universe are conducted by an uniform plan and directed to wise purposes as it is impossible for the human race to subsist at least in any comfortable or secure state without the protection of government this institution must certainly have been intended by that beneficent being who means the good of all his creatures and as it has universally in fact taken place in all countries and all ages we may conclude with still greater certainty that it was intended by that omniscient being who can never be deceived by any event or operation but since he gave rise to it not by any particular or miraculous interposition but by his concealed and universal efficacy a sovereign cannot properly speaking be called his vicegerent in any other sense than every power or force being derived from him may be said to act by his commission whatever actually happens is comprehended in the general plan or intention of providence nor has the greatest and most lawful prince any more reason upon that account to plead a peculiar sacredness or inviolable authority than an inferior magistrate or even an usurper or even a robber and a pyrate the same divine superintendant who for wise purposes invested a a titus or a trajan with authority did also for purposes no doubt equally wise though unknown bestow power on a borgia or an angria the same causes which gave rise to the sovereign power in every state established likewise every petty jurisdiction in it and every limited authority a constable therefore no less than a king acts by a divine commission and possesses an indefeasible right when we consider how nearly equal all men are in their bodily force and even in their mental powers and faculties till cultivated by education we must necessarily allow that nothing but their own consent could at first associate them together and subject them to any authority the people if we trace government to its first origin in the woods and desarts are the source of all power and jurisdiction and voluntarily for the sake of peace and order abandoned their native liberty and received laws from their equal and companion the conditions upon which they were willing to submit were either expressed or were so clear and obvious that it might well be esteemed superfluous to express them if this then be meant by the original contract it cannot be denied that all government is at first founded on a contract and that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed chiefly by that principle in vain are we asked in what records this charter of our liberties is registered it was not written on parchment nor yet on leaves or barks of trees it preceded the use of writing and all the other civilized arts of life but we trace it plainly in the nature of man and in the equality b or something approaching equality which we find in all the individuals of that species the force which now prevails and which is founded on fleets and armies is plainly political and derived from authority the effect of established government a mans natural force consists only in the vigour of his limbs and the firmness of his courage which could never subject multitudes to the command of one nothing but their own consent and their sense of the advantages resulting from peace and order could have had that influence c yet even this consent was long very imperfect and could not be the basis of a regular administration the chieftain who had probably acquired his influence during the continuance of war ruled more by persuasion than command and till he could employ force to reduce the refractory and disobedient the society could scarcely be said to have attained a state of civil government no compact or agreement it is evident was expressly formed for general submission an idea far beyond the comprehension of savages each exertion of authority in the chieftain must have been particular and called forth by the present exigencies of the case the sensible utility resulting from his interposition made these exertions become daily more frequent and their frequency gradually produced an habitual and if you please to call it so a voluntary and therefore precarious acquiescence in the people but philosophers who have embraced a party if that be not a contradiction in terms are not contented with these concessions they assert not only that government in its earliest infancy arose from consent or rather the voluntary acquiescence of the people but also that even at present when it has attained full maturity it rests on no other foundation they affirm that all men are still born equal and owe allegiance to no prince or government unless bound by the obligation and sanction of a promise and as no man without some equivalent would forego the advantages of his native liberty and subject himself to the will of another this promise is always understood to be conditional and imposes on him no obligation unless he meet with justice and protection from his sovereign these advantages the sovereign promises him in return and if he fail in the execution he has broken on his part the articles of engagement and has thereby freed his subject from all obligations to allegiance such according to these philosophers is the foundation of authority in every government and such the right of resistance possessed by every subject but would these reasoners look abroad into the world they would meet with nothing that in the least corresponds to their ideas or can warrant so refined and philosophical a system on the contrary we find every where princes who claim their subjects as their property and assert their independent right of sovereignty from conquest or succession we find also every where subjects who acknowledge this right in their prince and suppose themselves born under obligations of obedience to a certain sovereign as much as under the ties of reverence and duty to certain parents these connexions are always conceived to be equally independent of our consent in persia and china in france and spain and even in holland and england wherever the doctrines abovementioned have not been carefully inculcated obedience or subjection becomes so familiar that most men never make any enquiry about its origin or cause more than about the principle of gravity resistance or the most universal laws of nature or if curiosity ever move them as soon as they learn that they themselves and their ancestors have for several ages or from time immemorial been subject to such a form of government or such a family they immediately acquiesce and acknowledge their obligation to allegiance were you to preach in most parts of the world that political connexions are founded altogether on voluntary consent or a mutual promise the magistrate would soon imprison you as seditious for loosening the ties of obedience if your friends did not before shut you up as delirious for advancing such absurdities it is strange that an act of the mind which every individual is supposed to have formed and after he came to the use of reason too otherwise it could have no authority that this act say should be so much unknown to all of them that over the face of the whole earth there scarcely remain any traces or memory of it but the contract on which government is founded is said to be the original contract and consequently may be supposed too old to fall under the knowledge of the present generation if the agreement by which savage men first associated and conjoined their force be here meant this is acknowledged to be real but being so ancient and being obliterated by a thousand changes of government and princes it cannot now be supposed to retain any authority if we would say any thing to the purpose we must assert that every particular government which is lawful and which imposes any duty of allegiance on the subject was at first founded on consent and a voluntary compact but besides that this supposes the consent of the fathers to bind the children even to the most remote generations which republican writers will never allow besides this say it is not justified by history or experience in any age or country of the world almost all the governments which exist at present or of which there remains any record in story have been founded originally either on usurpation or conquest or both without any pretence of a fair consent or voluntary subjection of the people when an artful and bold man is placed at the head of an army or faction it is often easy for him by employing sometimes violence sometimes false pretences to establish his dominion over a people a hundred times more numerous than his partizans he allows no such open communication that his enemies can know with certainty their number or force he gives them no leisure to assemble together in a body to oppose him even all those who are the instruments of his usurpation may wish his fall but their ignorance of each others intention keeps them in awe and is the sole cause of his security by such arts as these many governments have been established and this is all the original contract which they have to boast of the face of the earth is continually changing by the encrease of small kingdoms into great empires by the dissolution of great empires into smaller kingdoms by the planting of colonies by the migration of tribes is there any thing discoverable in all these events but force and violence where is the mutual agreement or voluntary association so much talked of even the smoothest way by which a nation may receive a foreign master by marriage or a will is not extremely honourable for the people but supposes them to be disposed of like a dowry or a legacy according to the pleasure or interest of their rulers but where no force interposes and election takes place what is this election so highly vaunted it is either the combination of a few great men who decide for the whole and will allow of no opposition or it is the fury of a multitude that follow a seditious ringleader who is not known perhaps to a dozen among them and who owes his advancement merely to his own impudence or to the momentary caprice of his fellows are these disorderly elections which are rare too of such mighty authority as to be the only lawful foundation of all government and allegiance in reality there is not a more terrible event than a total dissolution of government which gives liberty to the multitude and makes the determination or choice of a new establishment depend upon a number which nearly approaches to that of the body of the people for it never comes entirely to the whole body of them every wise man then wishes to see at the head of a powerful and obedient army a general who may speedily seize the prize and give to the people a master which they are so unfit to chuse for themselves so little correspondent is fact and reality to those philosophical notions let not the establishment at the revolution deceive us or make us so much in love with a philosophical origin to government as to imagine all others monstrous and irregular even that event was far from corresponding to these refined ideas it was only the succession and that only in the regal part of the government which was then changed and it was only the majority of seven hundred who determined that change for near ten millions doubt not indeed but the bulk of those ten millions acquiesced willingly in the determination but was the matter left in the least to their choice was it not justly supposed to be from that moment decided and every man punished who refused to submit to the new sovereign how otherwise could the matter have ever been brought to any issue or conclusion the republic of athens was believe the most extensive democracy that we read of in history yet if we make the requisite allowances for the women the slaves and the strangers we shall find that that establishment was not at first made nor any law ever voted by a tenth part of those who were bound to pay obedience to it not to mention the islands and foreign dominions which the athenians claimed as theirs by right of conquest and as it is well known that popular assemblies in that city were always full of licence and disorder notwithstanding the institutions and laws by which they were checked how much more disorderly must they prove where they form not the established constitution but meet tumultuously on the dissolution of the ancient government in order to give rise to a new one how chimerical must it be to talk of a choice in such circumstances d the achæans enjoyed the freest and most perfect democracy of all antiquity yet they employed force to oblige some cities to enter into their league as we learn from polybius harry the ivth and harry the viith of england had really no title to the throne but a parliamentary election yet they never would acknowledge it lest they should thereby weaken their authority strange if the only real foundation of all authority be consent and promise it is in vain to say that all governments are or should be at first founded on popular consent as much as the necessity of human affairs will admit this favours entirely my pretension maintain that human affairs will never admit of this consent seldom of the appearance of it but that conquest or usurpation that is in plain terms force by dissolving the ancient governments is the origin of almost all the new ones which were ever established in the world and that in the few cases where consent may seem to have taken place it was commonly so irregular so confined or so much intermixed either with fraud or violence that it cannot have any great authority e my intention here is not to exclude the consent of the people from being one just foundation of government where it has place it is surely the best and most sacred of any only pretend that it has very seldom had place in any degree and never almost in its full extent and that therefore some other foundation of government must also be admitted were all men possessed of so inflexible a regard to justice that of themselves they would totally abstain from the properties of others they had for ever remained in a state of absolute liberty without subjection to any magistrate or political society but this is a state of perfection of which human nature is justly deemed incapable again were all men possessed of so perfect an understanding as always to know their own interests no form of government had ever been submitted to but what was established on consent and was fully canvassed by every member of the society but this state of perfection is likewise much superior to human nature reason history and experience shew us that all political societies have had an origin much less accurate and regular and were one to choose a period of time when the peoples consent was the least regarded in public transactions it would be precisely on the establishment of a new government in a settled constitution their inclinations are often consulted but during the fury of revolutions conquests and public convulsions military force or political craft usually decides the controversy when a new government is established by whatever means the people are commonly dissatisfied with it and pay obedience more from fear and necessity than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obligation the prince is watchful and jealous and must carefully guard against every beginning or appearance of insurrection time by degrees removes all these difficulties and accustoms the nation to regard as their lawful or native princes that family which at first they considered as usurpers or foreign conquerors in order to found this opinion they have no recourse to any notion of voluntary consent or promise which they know never was in this case either expected or demanded the original establishment was formed by violence and submitted to from necessity the subsequent administration is also supported by power and acquiesced in by the people not as a matter of choice but of obligation they imagine not that their consent gives their prince a title but they willingly consent because they think that from long possession he has acquired a title independent of their choice or inclination should it be said that by living under the dominion of a prince which one might leave every individual has given a tacit consent to his authority and promised him obedience it may be answered that such an implied consent can only have place where a man imagines that the matter depends on his choice but where he thinks as all mankind do who are born under established governments that by his birth he owes allegiance to a certain prince or certain form of government it would be absurd to infer a consent or choice which he expressly in this case renounces and disclaims can we seriously say that a poor peasant or artizan has a free choice to leave his country when he knows no foreign language or manners and lives from day to day by the small wages which he acquires we may as well assert that a man by remaining in a vessel freely consents to the dominion of the master though he was carried on board while asleep and must leap into the ocean and perish the moment he leaves her what if the prince forbid his subjects to quit his dominions as in tiberiuss time it was regarded as a crime in a roman knight that he had attempted to fly to the parthians in order to escape the tyranny of that emperor or as the ancient muscovites prohibited all travelling under pain of death and did a prince observe that many of his subjects were seized with the frenzy of migrating to foreign countries he would doubtless with great reason and justice restrain them in order to prevent the depopulation of his own kingdom would he forfeit the allegiance of all his subjects by so wise and reasonable a law yet the freedom of their choice is surely in that case ravished from them a company of men who should leave their native country in order to people some uninhabited region might dream of recovering their native freedom but they would soon find that their prince still laid claim to them and called them his subjects even in their new settlement and in this he would but act conformably to the common ideas of mankind the truest tacit consent of this kind that is ever observed is when a foreigner settles in any country and is beforehand acquainted with the prince and government and laws to which he must submit yet is his allegiance though more voluntary much less expected or depended on than that of a natural born subject on the contrary his native prince still asserts a claim to him and if he punish not the renegade when he seizes him in war with his new princes commission this clemency is not founded on the municipal law which in all countries condemns the prisoner but on the consent of princes who have agreed to this indulgence in order to prevent reprisals f did one generation of men go off the stage at once and another succeed as is the case with silkworms and butterflies the new race if they had sense enough to choose their government which surely is never the case with men might voluntarily and by general consent establish their own form of civil polity without any regard to the laws or precedents which prevailed among their ancestors but as human society is in perpetual flux one man every hour going out of the world another coming into it it is necessary in order to preserve stability in government that the new brood should conform themselves to the established constitution and nearly follow the path which their fathers treading in the footsteps of theirs had marked out to them some innovations must necessarily have place in every human institution and it is happy where the enlightened genius of the age give these a direction to the side of reason liberty and justice but violent innovations no individual is entitled to make they are even dangerous to be attempted by the legislature more ill than good is ever to be expected from them and if history affords examples to the contrary they are not to be drawn into precedent and are only to be regarded as proofs that the science of politics affords few rules which will not admit of some exception and which may not sometimes be controuled by fortune and accident the violent innovations in the reign of henry proceeded from an imperious monarch seconded by the appearance of legislative authority those in the reign of charles were derived from faction and fanaticism and both of them have proved happy in the issue but even the former were long the source of many disorders and still more dangers and if the measures of allegiance were to be taken from the latter a total anarchy must have place in human society and a final period at once be put to every government suppose that an usurper after having banished his lawful prince and royal family should establish his dominion for ten or a dozen years in any country and should preserve so exact a discipline in his troops and so regular a disposition in his garrisons that no insurrection had ever been raised or even murmur heard against his administration can it be asserted that the people who in their hearts abhor his treason have tacitly consented to his authority and promised him allegiance merely because from necessity they live under his dominion suppose again their native prince restored by means of an army which he levies in foreign countries they receive him with joy and exultation and shew plainly with what reluctance they had submitted to any other yoke may now ask upon what foundation the princes title stands not on popular consent surely for though the people willingly acquiesce in his authority they never imagine that their consent made him sovereign they consent because they apprehend him to be already by birth their lawful sovereign and as to that tacit consent which may now be inferred from their living under his dominion this is no more than what they formerly gave to the tyrant and usurper when we assert that all lawful government arises from the consent of the people we certainly do them a great deal more honour than they deserve or even expect and desire from us after the roman dominions became too unwieldly for the republic to govern them the people over the whole known world were extremely grateful to augustus for that authority which by violence he had established over them and they shewed an equal disposition to submit to the successor whom he left them by his last will and testament it was afterwards their misfortune that there never was in one family any long regular succession but that their line of princes was continually broken either by private assassinations or public rebellions the prætorian bands on the failure of every family set up one emperor the legions in the east a second those in germany perhaps a third and the sword alone could decide the controversy the condition of the people in that mighty monarchy was to be lamented not because the choice of the emperor was never left to them for that was impracticable but because they never fell under any succession of masters who might regularly follow each other as to the violence and wars and bloodshed occasioned by every new settlement these were not blameable because they were inevitable the house of lancaster ruled in this island about sixty yearsg yet the partizans of the white rose seemed daily to multiply in england the present establishment has taken place during a still longer period have all views of right in another family been utterly extinguished even though scarce any man now alive had arrived at years of discretion when it was expelled or could have consented to its dominion or have promised it allegiance a sufficient indication surely of the general sentiment of mankind on this head for we blame not the partizans of the abdicated family merely on account of the long time during which they have preserved their imaginary loyalty we blame them for adhering to a family which we affirm has been justly expelled and which from the moment the new settlement took place had forfeited all title to authority but would we have a more regular at least a more philosophical refutation of this principle of an original contract or popular consent perhaps the following observations may suffice all moral duties may be divided into two kinds the first are those to which men are impelled by a natural instinct or immediate propensity which operates on them independent of all ideas of obligation and of all views either to public or private utility of this nature are love of children gratitude to benefactors pity to the unfortunate when we reflect on the advantage which results to society from such humane instincts we pay them the just tribute of moral approbation and esteem but the person actuated by them feels their power and influence antecedent to any such reflection the second kind of moral duties are such as are not supported by any original instinct of nature but are performed entirely from a sense of obligation when we consider the necessities of human society and the impossibility of supporting it if these duties were neglected it is thus justice or a regard to the property of others fidelity or the observance of promises become obligatory and acquire an authority over mankind for as it is evident that every man loves himself better than any other person he is naturally impelled to extend his acquisitions as much as possible and nothing can restrain him in this propensity but reflection and experience by which he learns the pernicious effects of that licence and the total dissolution of society which must ensue from it his original inclination therefore or instinct is here checked and restrained by a subsequent judgment or observation the case is precisely the same with the political or civil duty of allegiance as with the natural duties of justice and fidelity our primary instincts lead us either to indulge ourselves in unlimited freedom or to seek dominion over others and it is reflection only which engages us to sacrifice such strong passions to the interests of peace and public order a small degree of experience and observation suffices to teach us that society cannot possibly be maintained without the authority of magistrates and that this authority must soon fall into contempt where exact obedience is not payed to it the observation of these general and obvious interests is the source of all allegiance and of that moral obligation which we attribute to it what necessity therefore is there to found the duty of allegiance or obedience to magistrates on that of fidelity or a regard to promises and to suppose that it is the consent of each individual which subjects him to government when it appears that both allegiance and fidelity stand precisely on the same foundation and are both submitted to by mankind on account of the apparent interests and necessities of human society we are bound to obey our sovereign it is said because we have given a tacit promise to that purpose but why are we bound to observe our promise it must here be asserted that the commerce and intercourse of mankind which are of such mighty advantage can have no security where men pay no regard to their engagements in like manner may it be said that men could not live at all in society at least in a civilized society without laws and magistrates and judges to prevent the encroachments of the strong upon the weak of the violent upon the just and equitable the obligation to allegiance being of like force and authority with the obligation to fidelity we gain nothing by resolving the one into the other the general interests or necessities of society are sufficient to establish both if the reason be asked of that obedience which we are bound to pay to government readily answer because society could not otherwise subsist and this answer is clear and intelligible to all mankind your answer is because we should keep our word but besides that no body till trained in a philosophical system can either comprehend or relish this answer besides this say you find yourself embarrassed when it is asked why we are bound to keep our word nor can you give any answer but what would immediately without any circuit have accounted for our obligation to allegiance but to whom is allegiance due and who is our lawful sovereign this question is often the most difficult of any and liable to infinite discussions when people are so happy that they can answer our present sovereign who inherits in a direct line from ancestors that have governed us for many ages this answer admits of no reply even though historians in tracing up to the remotest antiquity the origin of that royal family may find as commonly happens that its first authority was derived from usurpation and violence it is confessed that private justice or the abstinence from the properties of others is a most cardinal virtue yet reason tells us that there is no property in durable objects such as lands or houses when carefully examined in passing from hand to hand but must in some period have been founded on fraud and injustice the necessities of human society neither in private nor public life will allow of such an accurate enquiry and there is no virtue or moral duty but what may with facility be refined away if we indulge a false philosophy in sifting and scrutinizing it by every captious rule of logic in every light or position in which it may be placed the questions with regard to private property have filled infinite volumes of law and philosophy if in both we add the commentators to the original text and in the end we may safely pronounce that many of the rules there established are uncertain ambiguous and arbitrary the like opinion may be formed with regard to the succession and rights of princes and forms of governmenth several cases no doubt occur especially in the infancy of any constitution which admit of no determination from the laws of justice and equity and our historian rapin pretendsi that the controversy between edward the third and philip de valois was of this nature and could be decided only by an appeal to heaven that is by war and violence who shall tell me whether germanicus or drusus ought to have succeeded to tiberius had he died while they were both alive without naming any of them for his successor ought the right of adoption to be received as equivalent to that of blood in a nation where it had the same effect in private families and had already in two instances taken place in the public ought germanicus to be esteemed the elder son because he was born before drusus or the younger because he was adopted after the birth of his brother ought the right of the elder to be regarded in a nation where he had no advantage in the succession of private families ought the roman empire at that time to be deemed hereditary because of two examples or ought it even so early to be regarded as belonging to the stronger or to the present possessor as being founded on so recent an usurpation commodus mounted the throne after a pretty long succession of excellent emperors who had acquired their title not by birth or public election but by the fictitious rite of adoption that bloody debauchee being murdered by a conspiracy suddenly formed between his wench and her gallant who happened at that time to be prætorian præfect these immediately deliberated about choosing a master to human kind to speak in the style of those ages and they cast their eyes on pertinax before the tyrants death was known the præfect went secretly to that senator who on the appearance of the soldiers imagined that his execution had been ordered by commodus he was immediately saluted emperor by the officer and his attendants chearfully proclaimed by the populace unwillingly submitted to by the guards formally recognized by the senate and passively received by the provinces and armies of the empire the discontent of the prætorian bands broke out in a sudden sedition which occasioned the murder of that excellent prince and the world being now without a master and without government the guards thought proper to set the empire formally to sale julian the purchaser was proclaimed by the soldiers recognized by the senate and submitted to by the people and must also have been submitted to by the provinces had not the envy of the legions begotten opposition and resistance pescennius niger in syria elected himself emperor gained the tumultuary consent of his army and was attended with the secret goodwill of the senate and people of rome albinus in britain found an equal right to set up his claim but severus who governed pannonia prevailed in the end above both of them that able politician and warrior finding his own birth and dignity too much inferior to the imperial crown professed at first an intention only of revenging the death of pertinax he marched as general into italy defeated julian and without our being able to fix any precise commencement even of the soldiers consent he was from necessity acknowledged emperor by the senate and people and fully established in his violent authority by subduing niger and albinus inter hæc gordianus cæsar says capitolinus speaking of another period sublatus a militibus imperator est appellatus quia non erat alius in præsenti it is to be remarked that gordian was a boy of fourteen years of age frequent instances of a like nature occur in the history of the emperors in that of alexanders successors and of many other countries nor can any thing be more unhappy than a despotic government of this kind where the succession is disjointed and irregular and must be determined on every vacancy by force or election in a free government the matter is often unavoidable and is also much less dangerous the interests of liberty may there frequently lead the people in their own defence to alter the succession of the crown and the constitution being compounded of parts may still maintain a sufficient stability by resting on the aristocratical or democratical members though the monarchical be altered from time to time in order to accommodate it to the former in an absolute government when there is no legal prince who has a title to the throne it may safely be determined to belong to the first occupant instances of this kind are but too frequent especially in the eastern monarchies j when any race of princes expires the will or destination of the last sovereign will be regarded as a title thus the edict of lewis the xivth who called the bastard princes to the succession in case of the failure of all the legitimate princes would in such an event have some authorityk thus the will of charles the second disposed of the whole spanish monarchy the cession of the ancient proprietor especially when joined to conquest is likewise deemed a good title the general obligation which binds us to government is the interest and necessities of society and this obligation is very strong the determination of it to this or that particular prince or form of government is frequently more uncertain and dubious present possession has considerable authority in these cases and greater than in private property because of the disorders which attend all revolutions and changes of governmentl we shall only observe before we conclude that though an appeal to general opinion may justly in the speculative sciences of metaphysics natural philosophy or astronomy be deemed unfair and inconclusive yet in all questions with regard to morals as well as criticism there is really no other standard by which any controversy can ever be decided and nothing is a clearer proof that a theory of this kind is erroneous than to find that it leads to paradoxes repugnant to the common sentiments of mankind and to the practice and opinion of all nations and all ages the doctrine which founds all lawful government on an original contract or consent of the people is plainly of this kind nor has the most noted of its partizans in prosecution of it scrupled to affirm that absolute monarchy is inconsistent with civil society and so can be no form of civil government at all and that the supreme power in a state cannot take from any man by taxes and impositions any part of his property without his own consent or that of his representatives what authority any moral reasoning can have which leads into opinions so wide of the general practice of mankind in every place but this single kingdom it is easy to determinem the only passage meet with in antiquity where the obligation of obedience to government is ascribed to a promise is in platoscrito where socrates refuses to escape from prison because he had tacitly promised to obey the laws thus he builds a tory consequence of passive obedience on a whig foundation of the original contract new discoveries are not to be expected in these matters if scarce any man till very lately ever imagined that government was founded on compact it is certain that it cannot in general have any such foundation the crime of rebellion among the ancients was commonly expressed by the terms νεωτερίζειν novas res moliri essay of passive obedience in the former essay we endeavoured to refute the speculative systems of politics advanced in this nation as well the religious system of the one party as the philosophical of the other we come now to examine the practical consequences deduced by each party with regard to the measures of submission due to sovereigns as the obligation to justice is founded entirely on the interests of society which require mutual abstinence from property in order to preserve peace among mankind it is evident that when the execution of justice would be attended with very pernicious consequences that virtue must be suspended and give place to public utility in such extraordinary and such pressing emergencies the maxim fiat justitia ruat cœlum let justice be performed though the universe be destroyed is apparently false and by sacrificing the end to the means shews a preposterous idea of the subordination of duties what governor of a town makes any scruple of burning the suburbs when they facilitate the approaches of the enemy or what general abstains from plundering a neutral country when the necessities of war require it and he cannot otherwise subsist his army the case is the same with the duty of allegiance and common sense teaches us that as government binds us to obedience only on account of its tendency to public utility that duty must always in extraordinary cases when public ruin would evidently attend obedience yield to the primary and original obligation salus populi suprema lex the safety of the people is the supreme law this maxim is agreeable to the sentiments of mankind in all ages nor is any one when he reads of the insurrections against neroa or philip the second so infatuated with partysystems as not to wish success to the enterprize and praise the undertakers even our high monarchical party in spite of their sublime theory are forced in such cases to judge and feel and approve in conformity to the rest of mankind resistance therefore being admitted in extraordinary emergencies the question can only be among good reasoners with regard to the degree of necessity which can justify resistance and render it lawful or commendable and here must confess that shall always incline to their side who draw the bond of allegiance very close and consider an infringement of it as the last refuge in desperate cases when the public is in the highest danger from violence and tyranny for besides the mischiefs of a civil war which commonly attends insurrection it is certain that where a disposition to rebellion appears among any people it is one chief cause of tyranny in the rulers and forces them into many violent measures which they never would have embraced had every one been inclined to submission and obedience thus the tyrannicide or assassination approved of by ancient maxims instead of keeping tyrants and usurpers in awe made them ten times more fierce and unrelenting and is now justly upon that account abolished by the laws of nations and universally condemned as a base and treacherous method of bringing to justice these disturbers of society besides we must consider that as obedience is our duty in the common course of things it ought chiefly to be inculcated nor can any thing be more preposterous than an anxious care and solicitude in stating all the cases in which resistance may be allowed in like manner though a philosopher reasonably acknowledges in the course of an argument that the rules of justice may be dispensed with in cases of urgent necessity what should we think of a preacher or casuist who should make it his chief study to find out such cases and enforce them with all the vehemence of argument and eloquence would he not be better employed in inculcating the general doctrine than in displaying the particular exceptions which we are perhaps but too much inclined of ourselves to embrace and to extend there are however two reasons which may be pleaded in defence of that party among us who have with so much industry propagated the maxims of resistance maxims which it must be confessed are in general so pernicious and so destructive of civil society the first is that their antagonists carrying the doctrine of obedience to such an extravagant height as not only never to mention the exceptions in extraordinary cases which might perhaps be excusable but even positively to exclude them it became necessary to insist on these exceptions and defend the rights of injured truth and liberty the second and perhaps better reason is founded on the nature of the british constitution and form of government it is almost peculiar to our constitution to establish a first magistrate with such high preeminence and dignity that though limited by the laws he is in a manner so far as regards his own person above the laws and can neither be questioned nor punished for any injury or wrong which may be committed by him his ministers alone or those who act by his commission are obnoxious to justice and while the prince is thus allured by the prospect of personal safety to give the laws their free course an equal security is in effect obtained by the punishment of lesser offenders and at the same time a civil war is avoided which would be the infallible consequence were an attack at every turn made directly upon the sovereign but though the constitution pays this salutary compliment to the prince it can never reasonably be understood by that maxim to have determined its own destruction or to have established a tame submission where he protects his ministers perseveres in injustice and usurps the whole power of the commonwealth this case indeed is never expressly put by the laws because it is impossible for them in their ordinary course to provide a remedy for it or establish any magistrate with superior authority to chastise the exorbitancies of the prince but as a right without a remedy would be an absurdity the remedy in this case is the extraordinary one of resistance when affairs come to that extremity that the constitution can be defended by it alone resistance therefore must of course become more frequent in the british government than in others which are simpler and consist of fewer parts and movements where the king is an absolute sovereign he has little temptation to commit such enormous tyranny as may justly provoke rebellion but where he is limited his imprudent ambition without any great vices may run him into that perilous situation this is frequently supposed to have been the case with charles the first and if we may now speak truth after animosities are ceased this was also the case with james the second these were harmless if not in their private character good men but mistaking the nature of our constitution and engrossing the whole legislative power it became necessary to oppose them with some vehemence and even to deprive the latter formally of that authority which he had used with such imprudence and indiscretion essay of the coalition of parties to abolish all distinctions of party may not be practicable perhaps not desirable in a free government the only dangerous parties are such as entertain opposite views with regard to the essentials of government the succession of the crown or the more considerable privileges belonging to the several members of the constitution where there is no room for any compromise or accommodation and where the controversy may appear so momentous as to justify even an opposition by arms to the pretensions of antagonists of this nature was the animosity continued for above a century past between the parties in england an animosity which broke out sometimes into civil war which occasioned violent revolutions and which continually endangered the peace and tranquillity of the nation but as there have appeared of late the strongest symptoms of an universal desire to abolish these party distinctions this tendency to a coalition affords the most agreeable prospect of future happiness and ought to be carefully cherished and promoted by every lover of his country there is not a more effectual method of promoting so good an end than to prevent all unreasonable insult and triumph of the one party over the other to encourage moderate opinions to find the proper medium in all disputes to persuade each that its antagonist may possibly be sometimes in the right and to keep a balance in the praise and blame which we bestow on either side the two former essays concerning the original contract and passive obedience are calculated for this purpose with regard to the philosophicala and practical controversies between the parties and tend to show that neither side are in these respects so fully supported by reason as they endeavour to flatter themselves we shall proceed to exercise the same moderation with regard to the historical disputes between the parties by proving that each of them was justified by plausible topics that there were on both sides wise men who meant well to their country and that the past animosity between the factions had no better foundation than narrow prejudice or interested passion the popular party who afterwards acquired the name of whigs might justify by very specious arguments that opposition to the crown from which our present free constitution is derived though obliged to acknowledge that precedents in favour of prerogative had uniformly taken place during many reigns before charles the first they thought that there was no reason for submitting any longer to so dangerous an authority such might have been their reasoning as the rights of mankind are for ever to be deemed sacred no prescription of tyranny or arbitrary power can have authority sufficient to abolish them liberty is a blessing so inestimable that wherever there appears any probability of recovering it a nation may willingly run many hazards and ought not even to repine at the greatest effusion of blood or dissipation of treasure all human institutions and none more than government are in continual fluctuation kings are sure to embrace every opportunity of extending their prerogatives and if favourable incidents be not also laid hold of for extending and securing the privileges of the people an universal despotism must for ever prevail amongst mankind the example of all the neighbouring nations proves that it is no longer safe to entrust with the crown the same high prerogatives which had formerly been exercised during rude and simple ages and though the example of many late reigns may be pleaded in favour of a power in the prince somewhat arbitrary more remote reigns afford instances of stricter limitations imposed on the crown and those pretensions of the parliament now branded with the title of innovations are only a recovery of the just rights of the people these views far from being odious are surely large and generous and noble to their prevalence and success the kingdom owes its liberty perhaps its learning its industry commerce and naval power by them chiefly the english name is distinguished among the society of nations and aspires to a rivalship with that of the freest and most illustrious commonwealths of antiquity but as all these mighty consequences could not reasonably be foreseen at the time when the contest began the royalists of that age wanted not specious arguments on their side by which they could justify their defence of the then established prerogatives of the prince we shall state the question as it might have appeared to them at the assembling of that parliament which by its violent encroachments on the crown began the civil wars the only rule of government they might have said known and acknowledged among men is use and practice reason is so uncertain a guide that it will always be exposed to doubt and controversy could it ever render itself prevalent over the people men had always retained it as their sole rule of conduct they had still continued in the primitive unconnected state of nature without submitting to political government whose sole basis is not pure reason but authority and precedent dissolve these ties you break all the bonds of civil society and leave every man at liberty to consult his private interest by those expedients which his appetite disguised under the appearance of reason shall dictate to him the spirit of innovation is in itself pernicious however favourable its particular object may sometimes appear a truth so obvious that the popular party themselves are sensible of it and therefore cover their encroachments on the crown by the plausible pretence of their recovering the ancient liberties of the people but the present prerogatives of the crown allowing all the suppositions of that party have been incontestably established ever since the accession of the house of tudor a period which as it now comprehends a hundred and sixty years may be allowed sufficient to give stability to any constitution would it not have appeared ridiculous in the reign of the emperor adrian to have talked of the republican constitution as the rule of government or to have supposed that the former rights of the senate and consuls and tribunes were still subsisting but the present claims of the english monarchs are much more favourable than those of the roman emperors during that age the authority of augustus was a plain usurpation grounded only on military violence and forms such an epoch in the roman history as is obvious to every reader but if henry really as some pretend enlarged the power of the crown it was only by insensible acquisitions which escaped the apprehension of the people and have scarcely been remarked even by historians and politicians the new government if it deserve the epithet is an imperceptible transition from the former is entirely engrafted on it derives its title fully from that root and is to be considered only as one of those gradual revolutions to which human affairs in every nation will be for ever subject the house of tudor and after them that of stuart exercised no prerogatives but what had been claimed and exercised by the plantagenets not a single branch of their authority can be said to be an innovation the only difference is that perhaps former kings exerted these powers only by intervals and were not able by reason of the opposition of their barons to render them so steady a rule of administrationb but the sole inference from this fact is that those ancient times were more turbulent and seditious and that royal authority the constitution and the laws have happily of late gained the ascendant under what pretence can the popular party now speak of recovering the ancient constitution the former controul over the kings was not placed in the commons but in the barons the people had no authority and even little or no liberty till the crown by suppressing these factious tyrants enforced the execution of the laws and obliged all the subjects equally to respect each others rights privileges and properties if we must return to the ancient barbarous and c feudal constitution let those gentlemen who now behave themselves with so much insolence to their sovereign set the first example let them make court to be admitted as retainers to a neighbouring baron and by submitting to slavery under him acquire some protection to themselves together with the power of exercising rapine and oppression over their inferior slaves and villains this was the condition of the commons among their remote ancestors but how far back must we go in having recourse to ancient constitutions and governments there was a constitution still more ancient than that to which these innovators affect so much to appeal during that period there was no magna charta the barons themselves possessed few regular stated privileges and the house of commons probably had not an existence it is ridiculous to hear the commons while they are assuming by usurpation the whole power of government talk of reviving ancient institutions is it not known that though representatives received wages from their constituents to be a member of the lower house was always considered as a burden and an exemption from it as a privilege will they persuade us that power which of all human acquisitions is the most coveted and in comparison of which even reputation and pleasure and riches are slighted could ever be regarded as a burden by any man the property acquired of late by the commons it is said entitles them to more power than their ancestors enjoyed but to what is this encrease of their property owing but to an encrease of their liberty and their security let them therefore acknowledge that their ancestors while the crown was restrained by the seditious barons really enjoyed less liberty than they themselves have attained after the sovereign acquired the ascendant and let them enjoy that liberty with moderation and not forfeit it by new exorbitant claims and by rendering it a pretence for endless innovations the true rule of government is the present established practice of the age that has most authority because it is recent it is also best known for the same reason who has assured those tribunes that the plantagenets did not exercise as high acts of authority as the tudors historians they say do not mention them but historians are also silent with regard to the chief exertions of prerogative by the tudors where any power or prerogative is fully and undoubtedly established the exercise of it passes for a thing of course and readily escapes the notice of history and annals had we no other monuments of elizabeths reign than what are preserved even by camden the most copious judicious and exact of our historians we should be entirely ignorant of the most important maxims of her government was not the present monarchical government in its full extent authorized by lawyers recommended by divines acknowledged by politicians acquiesced in nay passionately cherished by the people in general and all this during a period of at least a hundred and sixty years and till of late without the smallest murmur or controversy this general consent surely during so long a time must be sufficient to render a constitution legal and valid if the origin of all power be derived as is pretended from the people here is their consent in the fullest and most ample terms that can be desired or imagined but the people must not pretend because they can by their consent lay the foundations of government that therefore they are to be permitted at their pleasure to overthrow and subvert them there is no end of these seditious and arrogant claims the power of the crown is now openly struck at the nobility are also in visible peril the gentry will soon follow the popular leaders who will then assume the name of gentry will next be exposed to danger and the people themselves having become incapable of civil government and lying under the restraint of no authority must for the sake of peace admit instead of their legal and mild monarchs a succession of military and despotic tyrants these consequences are the more to be dreaded as the present fury of the people though glossed over by pretensions to civil liberty is in reality incited by the fanaticism of religion a principle the most blind headstrong and ungovernable by which human nature can possibly be actuated popular rage is dreadful from whatever motive derived but must be attended with the most pernicious consequences when it arises from a principle which disclaims all controul by human law reason or authority these are the arguments which each party may make use of to justify the conduct of their predecessors during that great crisis the event if that can be admitted as a reason has shown that the arguments of the popular party were better founded but perhaps according to the established maxims of lawyers and politicians the views of the royalists ought beforehand to have appeared more solid more safe and more legal but this is certain that the greater moderation we now employ in representing past events the nearer shall we be to produce a full coalition of the parties and an entire acquiescence in our present establishment moderation is of advantage to every establishment nothing but zeal can overturn a settled power and an overactive zeal in friends is apt to beget a like spirit in antagonists the transition from a moderate opposition against an establishment to an entire acquiescence in it is easy and insensible there are many invincible arguments which should induce the malcontent party to acquiesce entirely in the present settlement of the constitution they now find that the spirit of civil liberty though at first connected with religious fanaticism could purge itself from that pollution and appear under a more genuine and engaging aspect a friend to toleration and an encourager of all the enlarged and generous sentiments that do honour to human nature they may observe that the popular claims could stop at a proper period and after retrenching the high claims of prerogative could still maintain a due respect to monarchy to nobility and to all ancient institutions above all they must be sensible that the very principle which made the strength of their party and from which it derived its chief authority has now deserted them and gone over to their antagonists the plan of liberty is settled its happy effects are proved by experience a long tract of time has given it stability and whoever would attempt to overturn it and to recall the past government or abdicated family would besides other more criminal imputations be exposed in their turn to the reproach of faction and innovation while they peruse the history of past events they ought to reflect both that those rights of the crown are long since annihilated and that the tyranny and violence and oppression to which they often gave rise are ills from which the established liberty of the constitution has now at last happily protected the people these reflections will prove a better security to our freedom and privileges than to deny contrary to the clearest evidence of facts that such regal powers ever had an existence there is not a more effectual method of betraying a cause than to lay the stress of the argument on a wrong place and by disputing an untenable post enure the adversaries to success and victory essay of the protestant succession suppose that a member of parliament in the reign of king william or queen anne while the establishment of the protestant succession was yet uncertain were deliberating concerning the party he would chuse in that important question and weighing with impartiality the advantages and disadvantages on each side believe the following particulars would have entered into his consideration he would easily perceive the great advantage resulting from the restoration of the stuart family by which we should preserve the succession clear and undisputed free from a pretender with such a specious title as that of blood which with the multitude is always the claim the strongest and most easily comprehended it is in vain to say as many have done that the question with regard to governors independent of government is frivolous and little worth disputing much less fighting about the generality of mankind never will enter into these sentiments and it is much happier believe for society that they do not but rather continue in their natural prepossessions how could stability be preserved in any monarchical government which though perhaps not the best is and always has been the most common of any unless men had so passionate a regard for the true heir of their royal family and even though he be weak in understanding or infirm in years gave him so sensible a preference above persons the most accomplished in shining talents or celebrated for great atchievements would not every popular leader put in his claim at every vacancy or even without any vacancy and the kingdom become the theatre of perpetual wars and convulsions the condition of the roman empire surely was not in this respect much to be envied nor is that of the eastern nations who pay little regard to the titles of their sovereign but sacrifice them every day to the caprice or momentary humour of the populace or soldiery it is but a foolish wisdom which is so carefully displayed in undervaluing princes and placing them on a level with the meanest of mankind to be sure an anatomist finds no more in the greatest monarch than in the lowest peasant or daylabourer and a moralist may perhaps frequently find less but what do all these reflections tend to we all of us still retain these prejudices in favour of birth and family and neither in our serious occupations nor most careless amusements can we ever get entirely rid of them a tragedy that should represent the adventures of sailors or porters or even of private gentlemen would presently disgust us but one that introduces kings and princes acquires in our eyes an air of importance and dignity or should a man be able by his superior wisdom to get entirely above such prepossessions he would soon by means of the same wisdom again bring himself down to them for the sake of society whose welfare he would perceive to be intimately connected with them far from endeavouring to undeceive the people in this particular he would cherish such sentiments of reverence to their princes as requisite to preserve a due subordination in society and though the lives of twenty thousand men be often sacrificed to maintain a king in possession of his throne or preserve the right of succession undisturbed he entertains no indignation at the loss on pretence that every individual of these was perhaps in himself as valuable as the prince he served he considers the consequences of violating the hereditary right of kings consequences which may be felt for many centuries while the loss of several thousand men brings so little prejudice to a large kingdom that it may not be perceived a few years after the advantages of the hanover succession are of an opposite nature and arise from this very circumstance that it violates hereditary right and places on the throne a prince to whom birth gave no title to that dignity it is evident from the history of this island that the privileges of the people have during near two centuries been continually upon the encrease by the division of the churchlands by the alienations of the barons estates by the progress of trade and above all by the happiness of our situation which for a long time gave us sufficient security without any standing army or military establishment on the contrary public liberty has almost in every other nation of europe been during the same period extremely upon the decline while the people were disgusted at the hardships of the old a feudal militia and rather chose to entrust their prince with mercenary armies which he easily turned against themselves it was nothing extraordinary therefore that some of our british sovereigns mistook the nature of the constitution at least the genius of the people and as they embraced all the favourable precedents left them by their ancestors they overlooked all those which were contrary and which supposed a limitation in our government they were encouraged in this mistake by the example of all the neighbouring princes who bearing the same title or appellation and being adorned with the same ensigns of authority naturally led them to claim the same powers and prerogatives b it appears from the speeches and proclamations of james and the whole train of that princes actions as well as his sons that he regarded the english government as a simple monarchy and never imagined that any considerable part of his subjects entertained a contrary idea this opinion made those monarchs discover their pretensions without preparing any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which are always employed by those who enter upon any new project or endeavour to innovate in any government the flattery of courtiers farther c confirmed their prejudices and above all that of the clergy who from several passages of scripture and these wrested too had erected a regular and avowed system of arbitrary power the only method of destroying at once all these high claims and pretensions was to depart from the true hereditary line and choose a prince who being plainly a creature of the public and receiving the crown on conditions expressed and avowed found his authority established on the same bottom with the privileges of the people by electing him in the royal line we cut off all hopes of ambitious subjects who might in future emergencies disturb the government by their cabals and pretensions by rendering the crown hereditary in his family we avoided all the inconveniencies of elective monarchy and by excluding the lineal heir we secured all our constitutional limitations and rendered our government uniform and of a piece the people cherish monarchy because protected by it the monarch favours liberty because created by it and thus every advantage is obtained by the new establishment as far as human skill and wisdom can extend itself these are the separate advantages of fixing the succession either in the house of stuart or in that of hanover there are also disadvantages in each establishment which an impartial patriot would ponder and examine in order to form a just judgment upon the whole the disadvantages of the protestant succession consist in the foreign dominions which are possessed by the princes of the hanover line and which it might be supposed would engage us in the intrigues and wars of the continent and lose us in some measure the inestimable advantage we possess of being surrounded and guarded by the sea which we command the disadvantages of recalling the abdicated family consist chiefly in their religion which is more prejudicial to society than that established amongst us is contrary to it and affords no toleration or peace or security to any other communion it appears to me that these advantages and disadvantages are allowed on both sides at least by every one who is at all susceptible of argument or reasoning no subject however loyal pretends to deny that the disputed title and foreign dominions of the present royal family are a loss nor is there any partizan of the stuarts but will confess that the claim of hereditary indefeasible right and the roman catholic religion are also disadvantages in that family it belongs therefore to a philosopher alone who is of neither party to put all the circumstances in the scale and assign to each of them its proper poise and influence such a one will readily at first acknowledge that all political questions are infinitely complicated and that there scarcely ever occurs in any deliberation a choice which is either purely good or purely ill consequences mixed and varied may be foreseen to flow from every measure and many consequences unforeseen do always in fact result from every one hesitation and reserve and suspence are therefore the only sentiments he brings to this essay or trial or if he indulges any passion it is that of derision against the ignorant multitude who are always clamorous and dogmatical even in the nicest questions of which from want of temper perhaps still more than of understanding they are altogether unfit judges but to say something more determinate on this head the following reflections will hope show the temper if not the understanding of a philosopher were we to judge merely by first appearances and by past experience we must allow that the advantages of a parliamentary title in the house of hanover are greater than those of an undisputed hereditary title in the house of stuart and that our fathers acted wisely in preferring the former to the latter so long as the house of stuart ruled in great britain which with some interruption was above eighty years the government was kept in a continual fever by the contention between the privileges of the people and the prerogatives of the crown if arms were dropped the noise of disputes continued or if these were silenced jealousy still corroded the heart and threw the nation into an unnatural ferment and disorder and while we were thus occupied in domestic disputes a foreign power dangerous to public liberty erected itself in europe without any opposition from us and even sometimes with our assistance but during these last sixty years when a parliamentary establishment has taken place whatever factions may have prevailed either among the people or in public assemblies the whole force of our constitution has always fallen to one side and an uninterrupted harmony has been preserved between our princes and our parliaments public liberty with internal peace and order has flourished almost without interruption trade and manufactures and agriculture have encreased the arts and sciences and philosophy have been cultivated even religious parties have been necessitated to lay aside their mutual rancour and the glory of the nation has spread itself all over europed derived equally from our progress in the arts of peace and from valour and success in war so long and so glorious a period no nation almost can boast of nor is there another instance in the whole history of mankind that so many millions of people have during such a space of time been held together in a manner so free so rational and so suitable to the dignity of human nature but though this recent experience seems clearly to decide in favour of the present establishment there are some circumstances to be thrown into the other scale and it is dangerous to regulate our judgment by one event or example we have had two rebellions during the flourishing period above mentioned besides plots and conspiracies without number and if none of these have produced any very fatal event we may ascribe our escape chiefly to the narrow genius of those princes who disputed our establishment and we may esteem ourselves so far fortunate but the claims of the banished family fear are not yet antiquated and who can foretel that their future attempts will produce no greater disorder the disputes between privilege and prerogative may easily be composed by laws and votes and conferences and concessions where there is tolerable temper or prudence on both sides or on either side among contending titles the question can only be determined by the sword and by devastation and by civil war a prince who fills the throne with a disputed title dares not arm his subjects the only method of securing a people fully both against domestic oppression and foreign conquest notwithstanding our riches and renown what a critical escape did we make by the late peace from dangers which were owing not so much to bad conduct and ill success in war as to the pernicious practice of mortgaging our finances and the still more pernicious maxim of never paying off our incumbrances such fatal measures would not probably have been embraced had it not been to secure a precarious establishmente but to convince us that an hereditary title is to be embraced rather than a parliamentary one which is not supported by any other views or motives a man needs only transport himself back to the æra of the restoration and suppose that he had had a seat in that parliament which recalled the royal family and put a period to the greatest disorders that ever arose from the opposite pretensions of prince and people what would have been thought of one that had proposed at that time to set aside charles and settle the crown on the duke of york or gloucester merely in order to exclude all high claims like those of their father and grandfather would not such a one have been regarded as an extravagant projector who loved dangerous remedies and could tamper and play with a government and national constitution like a quack with a sickly patientf in reality the reason assigned by the nation for excluding the race of stuart and so many other branches of the royal family is not on account of their hereditary title a reason which would to vulgar apprehensions have appeared altogether absurd but on account of their religion which leads us to compare the disadvantages above mentioned in each establishment confess that considering the matter in general it were much to be wished that our prince had no foreign dominions and could confine all his attention to the government of this island for not to mention some real inconveniencies that may result from territories on the continent they afford such a handle for calumny and defamation as is greedily seized by the people always disposed to think ill of their superiors it must however be acknowledged that hanover is perhaps the spot of ground in europe the least inconvenient for a king of england it lies in the heart of germany at a distance from the great powers which are our natural rivals it is protected by the laws of the empire as well as by the arms of its own sovereign and it serves only to connect us more closely with the house of austria our natural allyg the religious persuasion of the house of stuart is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye and would threaten us with much more dismal consequences the roman catholic religion with its train of priests and friers is more expensive than ours even though unaccompanied with its natural attendants of inquisitors and stakes and gibbets it is less tolerating and not content with dividing the sacerdotal from the regal office which must be prejudicial to any state it bestows the former on a foreigner who has always a separate interest from that of the public and may often have an opposite one but were this religion ever so advantageous to society it is contrary to that which is established among us and which is likely to keep possession for a long time of the minds of the people and though it is much to be hoped that the progress of reason will by degrees abate the h acrimony of opposite religions all over europe yet the spirit of moderation has as yet made too slow advances to be entirely trustedi thus upon the whole the advantages of the settlement in the family of stuart which frees us from a disputed title seem to bear some proportion with those of the settlement in the family of hanover which frees us from the claims of prerogative but at the same time its disadvantages by placing on the throne a roman catholic are greater than those of the other establishment in settling the crown on a foreign prince what party an impartial patriot in the reign of k william or q anne would have chosen amidst these opposite views may perhaps to some appear hard to determinej but the settlement in the house of hanover has actually taken place the princes of that family without intrigue without cabal without solicitation on their part have been called to mount our throne by the united voice of the whole legislative body they have since their accession displayed in all their actions the utmost mildness equity and regard to the laws and constitution our own ministers our own parliaments ourselves have governed us and if aught ill has befallen us we can only blame fortune or ourselves what a reproach must we become among nations if disgusted with a settlement so deliberately made and whose conditions have been so religiously observed we should throw every thing again into confusion and by our levity and rebellious disposition prove ourselves totally unfit for any state but that of absolute slavery and subjection the greatest inconvenience attending a disputed title is that it brings us in danger of civil wars and rebellions what wise man to avoid this inconvenience would run directly into a civil war and rebellion not to mention that so long possession secured by so many laws must ere this time in the apprehension of a great part of the nation have begotten a title in the house of hanover independent of their present possession so that now we should not even by a revolution obtain the end of avoiding a disputed title no revolution made by national forces will ever be able without some other great necessity to abolish our debts and incumbrances in which the interest of so many persons is concerned and a revolution made by foreign forces is a conquest a calamity with which the precarious balance of power threatens us and which our civil dissentions are likely above all other circumstances to bring upon us essay idea of a perfect commonwealth it is not with forms of government as with other artificial contrivances where an old engine may be rejected if we can discover another more accurate and commodious or where trials may safely be made even though the success be doubtful an established government has an infinite advantage by that very circumstance of its being established the bulk of mankind being governed by authority not reason and never attributing authority to any thing that has not the recommendation of antiquity to tamper therefore in this affair or try experiments merely upon the credit of supposed argument and philosophy can never be the part of a wise magistrate who will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age and though he may attempt some improvements for the public good yet will he adjust his innovations as much as possible to the ancient fabric and preserve entire the chief pillars and supports of the constitution the mathematicians in europe have been much divided concerning that figure of a ship which is the most commodious for sailing and huygens who at last determined the controversy is justly thought to have obliged the learned as well as commercial world though columbus had sailed to america and sir francis drake made the tour of the world without any such discovery as one form of government must be allowed more perfect than another independent of the manners and humours of particular men why may we not enquire what is the most perfect of all though the common botched and inaccurate governments seem to serve the purposes of society and though it be not so easy to establish a new system of government as to build a vessel upon a new construction the subject is surely the most worthy curiosity of any the wit of man can possibly devise and who knows if this controversy were fixed by the universal consent of the wise and learned but in some future age an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice either by a dissolution of some old government or by the combination of men to form a new one in some distant part of the world in all cases it must be advantageous to know what is most perfect in the kind that we may be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as possible by such gentle alterations and innovations as may not give too great disturbance to society all pretend to in the present essay is to revive this subject of speculation and therefore shall deliver my sentiments in as few words as possible a long dissertation on that head would not apprehend be very acceptable to the public who will be apt to regard such disquisitions both as useless and chimerical all plans of government which suppose great reformation in the manners of mankind are plainly imaginary of this nature are the republic of plato and the utopia of sir thomas more the oceana is the only valuable model of a commonwealth that has yet been offered to the public the chief defects of the oceana seem to be these first its rotation is inconvenient by throwing men of whatever abilities by intervals out of public employments secondly its agrarian is impracticable men will soon learn the art which was practised in ancient rome of concealing their possessions under other peoples name till at last the abuse will become so common that they will throw off even the appearance of restraint thirdly the oceana provides not a sufficient security for liberty or the redress of grievances the senate must propose and the people consent by which means the senate have not only a negative upon the people but what is of much greater consequence their negative goes before the votes of the people were the kings negative of the same nature in the english constitution and could he prevent any bill from coming into parliament he would be an absolute monarch as his negative follows the votes of the houses it is of little consequence such a difference is there in the manner of placing the same thing when a popular bill has been debated in parliament is brought to maturity all its conveniencies and inconveniencies weighed and balanced if afterwards it be presented for the royal assent few princes will venture to reject the unanimous desire of the people but could the king crush a disagreeable bill in embryo as was the case for some time in the scottish parliament by means of the lords of the articles the british government would have no balance nor would grievances ever be redressed and it is certain that exorbitant power proceeds not in any government from new laws so much as from neglecting to remedy the abuses which frequently rise from the old ones a government says machiavel must often be brought back to its original principles it appears then that in the oceana the whole legislature may be said to rest in the senate which harrington would own to be an inconvenient form of government especially after the agrarian is abolished here is a form of government to which cannot in theory discover any considerable objection a let great britain and ireland or any territory of equal extent be divided into counties and each county into parishes making in all if the country proposed to be erected into a commonwealth be of more narrow extent we may diminish the number of counties but never bring them below thirty if it be of greater extent it were better to enlarge the parishes or throw more parishes into a county than encrease the number of counties b let all the freeholders of twenty pounds ayear in the county and all the householders worth pounds in the town parishes meet annually in the parish church and chuse by ballot some freeholder of the county for their member whom we shall call the county representative let the county representatives two days after their election meet in the county town and chuse by ballot from their own body ten county magistrates and one senator there are therefore in the whole commonwealth senators county magistrates and county representatives for we shall bestow on all senators the authority of county magistrates and on all county magistrates the authority of county representatives let the senators meet in the capital and be endowed with the whole executive power of the commonwealth the power of peace and war of giving orders to generals admirals and ambassadors and in short all the prerogatives of a british king except his negative let the county representatives meet in their particular counties and possess the whole legislative power of the commonwealth the greater number of counties deciding the question and where these are equal let the senate have the casting vote every new law must first be debated in the senate and though rejected by it if ten senators insist and protest it must be sent down to the counties the senate if they please may join to the copy of the law their reasons for receiving or rejecting it because it would be troublesome to assemble all the county representatives for every trivial law that may be requisite the senate have their choice of sending down the law either to the county magistrates or county representatives the magistrates though the law be referred to them may if they please call the representatives and submit the affair to their determination whether the law be referred by the senate to the county magistrates or representatives a copy of it and of the senates reasons must be sent to every representative eight days before the day appointed for the assembling in order to deliberate concerning it and though the determination be by the senate referred to the magistrates if five representatives of the county order the magistrates to assemble the whole court of representatives and submit the affair to their determination they must obey either the county magistrates or representatives may give to the senator of the county the copy of a law to be proposed to the senate and if five counties concur in the same order the law though refused by the senate must come either to the county magistrates or representatives as is contained in the order of the five counties any twenty counties by a vote either of their magistrates or representatives may throw any man out of all public offices for a year thirty counties for three years the senate has a power of throwing out any member or number of members of its own body not to be reelected for that year the senate cannot throw out twice in a year the senator of the same county the power of the old senate continues for three weeks after the annual election of the county representatives then all the new senators are shut up in a conclave like the cardinals and by an intricate ballot such as that of venice or malta they chuse the following magistrates a protector who represents the dignity of the commonwealth and presides in the senate two secretaries of state these six councils a council of state a council of religion and learning a council of trade a council of laws a council of war a council of the admiralty each council consisting of five persons together with six commissioners of the treasury and a first commissioner all these must be senators the senate also names all the ambassadors to foreign courts who may either be senators or not the senate may continue any or all of these but must reelect them every year the protector and two secretaries have session and suffrage in the council of state the business of that council is all foreign politics the council of state has session and suffrage in all the other councils the council of religion and learning inspects the universities and clergy that of trade inspects every thing that may affect commerce that of laws inspects all the abuses of law by the inferior magistrates and examines what improvements may be made of the municipal law that of war inspects the militia and its discipline magazines stores c and when the republic is in war examines into the proper orders for generals the council of admiralty has the same power with regard to the navy together with the nomination of the captains and all inferior officers none of these councils can give orders themselves except where they receive such powers from the senate in other cases they must communicate every thing to the senate when the senate is under adjournment any of the councils may assemble it before the day appointed for its meeting besides these councils or courts there is another called the court of competitors which is thus constituted if any candidates for the office of senator have more votes than a third of the representatives that candidate who has most votes next to the senator elected becomes incapable for one year of all public offices even of being a magistrate or representative but he takes his seat in the court of competitors here then is a court which may sometimes consist of a hundred members sometimes have no members at all and by that means be for a year abolished the court of competitors has no power in the commonwealth it has only the inspection of public accounts and the accusing of any man before the senate if the senate acquit him the court of competitors may if they please appeal to the people either magistrates or representatives upon that appeal the magistrates or representatives meet on the day appointed by the court of competitors and chuse in each county three persons from which number every senator is excluded these to the number of meet in the capital and bring the person accused to a new trial the court of competitors may propose any law to the senate and if refused may appeal to the people that is to the magistrates or representatives who examine it in their counties every senator who is thrown out of the senate by a vote of the court takes his seat in the court of competitors the senate possesses all the judicative authority of the house of lords that is all the appeals from the inferior courts it likewise appoints the lord chancellor and all the officers of the law every county is a kind of republic within itself and the representatives may make byelaws which have no authority till three months after they are voted a copy of the law is sent to the senate and to every other county the senate or any single county may at any time annul any byelaw of another county the representatives have all the authority of the british justices of peace in trials commitments c the magistrates have the appointment of all the officers of the revenue in each county all causes with regard to the revenue are carried ultimately by appeal before the magistrates they pass the accompts of all the officers but must have their own accompts examined and passed at the end of the year by the representatives the magistrates name rectors or ministers to all the parishes the presbyterian government is established and the highest ecclesiastical court is an assembly or synod of all the presbyters of the county the magistrates may take any cause from this court and determine it themselves the magistrates may try and depose or suspend any presbyter the militia is established in imitation of that of swisserland which being well known we shall not insist upon it it will only be proper to make this addition that an army of men be annually drawn out by rotation paid and encamped during six weeks in summer that the duty of a camp may not be altogether unknown the magistrates appoint all the colonels and downwards the senate all upwards during war the general appoints the colonel and downwards and his commission is good for a twelvemonth but after that it must be confirmed by the magistrates of the county to which the regiment belongs the magistrates may break any officer in the county regiment and the senate may do the same to any officer in the service if the magistrates do not think proper to confirm the generals choice they may appoint another officer in the place of him they reject all crimes are tried within the county by the magistrates and a jury but the senate can stop any trial and bring it before themselves any county may indict any man before the senate for any crime the protector the two secretaries the council of state with any five or more that the senate appoints are possessed on extraordinary emergencies of dictatorial power for six months the protector may pardon any person condemned by the inferior courts in time of war no officer of the army that is in the field can have any civil office in the commonwealth the capital which we shall call london may be allowed four members in the senate it may therefore be divided into four counties the representatives of each of these chuse one senator and ten magistrates there are therefore in the city four senators fortyfour magistrates and four hundred representatives the magistrates have the same authority as in the counties the representatives also have the same authority but they never meet in one general court they give their votes in their particular county or division of hundreds when they enact any byelaw the greater number of counties or divisions determines the matter and where these are equal the magistrates have the casting vote the magistrates chuse the mayor sheriff recorder and other officers of the city in the commonwealth no representative magistrate or senator as such has any salary the protector secretaries councils and ambassadors have salaries the first year in every century is set apart for correcting all inequalities which time may have produced in the representative this must be done by the legislature the following political aphorisms may explain the reason of these orders the lower sort of people and small proprietors are good judges enough of one not very distant from them in rank or habitation and therefore in their parochial meetings will probably chuse the best or nearly the best representative but they are wholly unfit for countymeetings and for electing into the higher offices of the republic their ignorance gives the grandees an opportunity of deceiving them ten thousand even though they were not annually elected are a basis large enough for any free government it is true the nobles in poland are more than and yet these oppress the people but as power always continues there in the same persons and families this makes them in a manner a different nation from the people besides the nobles are there united under a few heads of families all free governments must consist of two councils a lesser and greater or in other words of a senate and people the people as harrington observes would want wisdom without the senate the senate without the people would want honesty a large assembly of for instance to represent the people if allowed to debate would fall into disorder if not allowed to debate the senate has a negative upon them and the worst kind of negative that before resolution here therefore is an inconvenience which no government has yet fully remedied but which is the easiest to be remedied in the world if the people debate all is confusion if they do not debate they can only resolve and then the senate carves for them divide the people into many separate bodies and then they may debate with safety and every inconvenience seems to be prevented cardinal de retz says that all numerous assemblies however composed are mere mob and swayed in their debates by the least motive this we find confirmed by daily experience when an absurdity strikes a member he conveys it to his neighbour and so on till the whole be infected separate this great body and though every member be only of middling sense it is not probable that any thing but reason can prevail over the whole influence and example being removed good sense will always get the better of bad among a number of peoplec there are two things to be guarded against in every senate its combination and its division its combination is most dangerous and against this inconvenience we have provided the following remedies the great dependence of the senators on the people by annual elections and that not by an undistinguishing rabble like the english electors but by men of fortune and education the small power they are allowed they have few offices to dispose of almost all are given by the magistrates in the counties the court of competitors which being composed of men that are their rivals next to them in interest and uneasy in their present situation will be sure to take all advantages against them the division of the senate is prevented by the smallness of their number as faction supposes a combination in a separate interest it is prevented by their dependence on the people they have a power of expelling any factious member it is true when another member of the same spirit comes from the county they have no power of expelling him nor is it fit they should for that shows the humour to be in the people and may possibly arise from some ill conduct in public affairs almost any man in a senate so regularly chosen by the people may be supposed fit for any civil office it would be proper therefore for the senate to form some general resolutions with regard to the disposing of offices among the members which resolutions would not confine them in critical times when extraordinary parts on the one hand or extraordinary stupidity on the other appears in any senator but they would be sufficient to preventd intrigue and faction by making the disposal of the offices a thing of course for instance let it be a resolution that no man shall enjoy any office till he has sat four years in the senate that except ambassadors no man shall be in office two years following that no man shall attain the higher offices but through the lower that no man shall be protector twice c the senate of venice govern themselves by such resolutions in foreign politics the interest of the senate can scarcely ever be divided from that of the people and therefore it is fit to make the senate absolute with regard to them otherwise there could be no secrecy or refined policy besides without money no alliance can be executed and the senate is still sufficiently dependant not to mention that the legislative power being always superior to the executive the magistrates or representatives may interpose whenever they think proper the chief support of the british government is the opposition of interests but that though in the main serviceable breeds endless factions in the foregoing plan it does all the good without any of the harm the competitors have no power of controlling the senate they have only the power of accusing and appealing to the people it is necessary likewise to prevent both combination and division in the thousand magistrates this is done sufficiently by the separation of places and interests but lest that should not be sufficient their dependence on the for their elections serves to the same purpose nor is that all for the may resume the power whenever they please and not only when they all please but when any five of a hundred please which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a separate interest the are too large a body either to unite or divide except when they meet in one place and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders not to mention their annual electione by the whole body of the people that are of any consideration a small commonwealth is the happiest government in the world within itself because every thing lies under the eye of the rulers but it may be subdued by great force from without this scheme seems to have all the advantages both of a great and a little commonwealth every countylaw may be annulled either by the senate or another county because that shows an opposition of interest in which case no part ought to decide for itself the matter must be referred to the whole which will best determine what agrees with general interest as to the clergy and militia the reasons of these orders are obvious without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magistrates and without a militia it is in vain to think that any free government will ever have security or stability in many governments the inferior magistrates have no rewards but what arise from their ambition vanity or public spirit the salaries of the french judges amount not to the interest of the sums they pay for their offices the dutch burgomasters have little more immediate profit than the english justices of peace or the members of the house of commons formerly but lest any should suspect that this would beget negligence in the administration which is little to be feared considering the natural ambition of mankind let the magistrates have competent salaries the senators have access to so many honourable and lucrative offices that their attendance needs not be bought there is little attendance required of the representatives that the foregoing plan of government is practicable no one can doubt who considers the resemblance that it bears to the commonwealth of the united provincesf a wise and renowned government the alterations in the present scheme seem all evidently for the better the representation is more equal the unlimited power of the burgomasters in the towns which forms a perfect aristocracy in the dutch commonwealth is corrected by a welltempered democracy in giving to the people the annual election of the county representatives the negative which every province and town has upon the whole body of the dutch republic with regard to alliances peace and war and the imposition of taxes is here removed the counties in the present plan are not so independent of each other nor do they form separate bodies so much as the seven provinces where the jealousy and envy of the smaller provinces and towns against the greater particularly holland and amsterdam have frequently disturbed the government larger powers though of the safest kind are intrusted to the senate than the statesgeneral possess by which means the former may become more expeditious and secret in their resolutions than it is possible for the latter the chief alterations that could be made on the british government in order to bring it to the most perfect model of limited monarchy seem to be the following first the plan of gcromwells parliament ought to be restored by making the representation equal and by allowing none to vote in the county elections who possess noth a property of pounds value secondly as such a house of commons would be too weighty for a frail house of lords like the present the bishops and scotch peers ought to be removedi the number of the upper house ought to be raised to three or four hundred their seats not hereditary but during life they ought to have the election of their own members and no commoner should be allowed to refuse a seat that was offered him by this means the house of lords would consist entirely of the men of chief credit abilities and interest in the nation and every turbulent leader in the house of commons might be taken off and connected by interest with the house of peers such an aristocracy would be an excellent barrier both to the monarchy and against it at present the balance of our government depends in some measure on the abilities and behaviour of the sovereign which are variable and uncertain circumstances this plan of limited monarchy however corrected seems still liable to three great inconveniencies first it removes not entirely though it may soften the parties of court and country secondly the kings personal character must still have great influence on the government thirdly the sword is in the hands of a single person who will always neglect to discipline the militia in order to have a pretence for keeping up a standing armyj we shall conclude this subject with observing the falsehood of the common opinion that no large state such as france or great britain could ever be modelled into a commonwealth but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory the contrary seems probable though it is more difficult to form a republican government in an extensive country than in a city there is more facility when once it is formed of preserving it steady and uniform without tumult and faction it is not easy for the distant parts of a large state to combine in any plan of free government but they easily conspire in the esteem and reverence for a single person who by means of this popular favour may seize the power and forcing the more obstinate to submit may establish a monarchical government on the other hand a city readily concurs in the same notions of government the natural equality of property favours liberty and the nearness of habitation enables the citizens mutually to assist each other even under absolute princes the subordinate government of cities is commonly republican while that of counties and provinces is monarchical but these same circumstances which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities render their constitution more frail and uncertain democracies are turbulent for however the people may be separated or divided into small parties either in their votes or elections their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tides and currents very sensible aristocracies are better adapted for peace and order and accordingly were most admired by ancient writers but they are jealous and oppressive in a large government which is modelled with masterly skill there is compass and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people who may be admitted into the first elections or first concoction of the commonwealth to the higher magistrates who direct all the movements at the same time the parts are so distant and remote that it is very difficult either by intrigue prejudice or passion to hurry them into any measures against the public interest it is needless to enquire whether such a government would be immortal allow the justness of the poets exclamation on the endless projects of human race man and for ever the world itself probably is not immortal such consuming plagues may arise as would leave even a perfect government a weak prey to its neighbours we know not to what length enthusiasm or other extraordinary movements of the human mind may transport men to the neglect of all order and public good where difference of interest is removed whimsical and unaccountable factions often arise from personal favour or enmity perhaps rust may grow to the springs of the most accurate political machine and disorder its motions lastly extensive conquests when pursued must be the ruin of every free government and of the more perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect because of the very advantages which the former possess above the latter and though such a state ought to establish a fundamental law against conquests yet republics have ambition as well as individuals and present interest makes men forgetful of their posterity it is a sufficient incitement to human endeavours that such a government would flourish for many ages without pretending to bestow on any work of man that immortality which the almighty seems to have refused to his own productions essays withdrawn and unpublished essay of essaywriting the elegant part of mankind who are not immersd in the animal life but employ themselves in the operations of the mind may be divided into the learned and conversible the learned are such as have chosen for their portion the higher and more difficult operations of the mind which require leisure and solitude and cannot be brought to perfection without long preparation and severe labour the conversible world join to a sociable disposition and a taste of pleasure an inclination to the easier and more gentle exercises of the understanding to obvious reflections on human affairs and the duties of common life and to the observation of the blemishes or perfections of the particular objects that surround them such subjects of thought furnish not sufficient employment in solitude but require the company and conversation of our fellowcreatures to render them a proper exercise for the mind and this brings mankind together in society where every one displays his thoughts and observations in the best manner he is able and mutually gives and receives information as well as pleasure the separation of the learned from the conversible world seems to have been the great defect of the last age and must have had a very bad influence both on books and company for what possibility is there of finding topics of conversation fit for the entertainment of rational creatures without having recourse sometimes to history poetry politics and the more obvious principles at least of philosophy must our whole discourse be a continued series of gossipping stories and idle remarks must the mind never rise higher but be perpetually stund and worn out with endless chat of will did this and nan said that this woud be to render the time spent in company the most unentertaining as well as the most unprofitable part of our lives on the other hand learning has been as great a loser by being shut up in colleges and cells and secluded from the world and good company by that means every thing of what we call belles lettres became totally barbarous being cultivated by men without any taste of life or manners and without that liberty and facility of thought and expression which can only be acquird by conversation even philosophy went to wrack by this moaping recluse method of study and became as chimerical in her conclusions as she was unintelligible in her stile and manner of delivery and indeed what coud be expected from men who never consulted experience in any of their reasonings or who never searchd for that experience where alone it is to be found in common life and conversation tis with great pleasure observe that men of letters in this age have lost in a great measure that shyness and bashfulness of temper which kept them at a distance from mankind and at the same time that men of the world are proud of borrowing from books their most agreeable topics of conversation tis to be hopd that this league betwixt the learned and conversible worlds which is so happily begun will be still farther improvd to their mutual advantage and to that end know nothing more advantageous than such essays as these with which endeavour to entertain the public in this view cannot but consider myself as a kind of resident or ambassador from the dominions of learning to those of conversation and shall think it my constant duty to promote a good correspondence betwixt these two states which have so great a dependence on each other shall give intelligence to the learned of whatever passes in company and shall endeavour to import into company whatever commodities find in my native country proper for their use and entertainment the balance of trade we need not be jealous of nor will there be any difficulty to preserve it on both sides the materials of this commerce must chiefly be furnishd by conversation and common life the manufacturing of them alone belongs to learning as twoud be an unpardonable negligence in an ambassador not to pay his respects to the sovereign of the state where he is commissiond to reside so it woud be altogether inexcusable in me not to address myself with a particular respect to the fair sex who are the sovereigns of the empire of conversation approach them with reverence and were not my countrymen the learned a stubborn independent race of mortals extremely jealous of their liberty and unaccustomd to subjection shoud resign into their fair hands the sovereign authority over the republic of letters as the case stands my commission extends no farther than to desire a league offensive and defensive against our common enemies against the enemies of reason and beauty people of dull heads and cold hearts from this moment let us pursue them with the severest vengeance let no quarter be given but to those of sound understandings and delicate affections and these characters tis to be presumd we shall always find inseparable to be serious and to quit the allusion before it be worn threadbare am of opinion that women that is women of sense and education for to such alone address myself are much better judges of all polite writing than men of the same degree of understanding and that tis a vain pannic if they be so far terrifyd with the common ridicule that is levelld against learned ladies as utterly to abandon every kind of books and study to our sex let the dread of that ridicule have no other effect than to make them conceal their knowledge before fools who are not worthy of it nor of them such will still presume upon the vain title of the male sex to affect a superiority above them but my fair readers may be assurd that all men of sense who know the world have a great deference for their judgment of such books as ly within the compass of their knowledge and repose more confidence in the delicacy of their taste tho unguided by rules than in all the dull labours of pedants and commentators in a neighbouring nation equally famous for good taste and for gallantry the ladies are in a manner the sovereigns of the learned world as well as of the conversible and no polite writer pretends to venture upon the public without the approbation of some celebrated judges of that sex their verdict is indeed sometimes complaind of and in particular find that the admirers of corneille to save that great poets honour upon the ascendant that racine began to take over him always said that it was not to be expected that so old a man could dispute the prize before such judges with so young a man as his rival but this observation has been found unjust since posterity seems to have ratifyd the verdict of that tribunal and racine tho dead is still the favourite of the fair sex as well as of the best judges among the men there is only one subject on which am apt to distrust the judgment of females and that is concerning books of gallantry and devotion which they commonly affect as high flown as possible and most of them seem more delighted with the warmth than with the justness of the passion mention gallantry and devotion as the same subject because in reality they become the same when treated in this manner and we may observe that they both depend upon the very same complexion as the fair sex have a great share of the tender and amorous disposition it perverts their judgment on this occasion and makes them be easily affected even by what has no propriety in the expression nor nature in the sentiment mr addisons elegant discourses of religion have no relish with them in comparison of books of mystic devotion and otways tragedies are rejected for the rants of mr dryden woud the ladies correct their false taste in this particular let them accustom themselves a little more to books of all kinds let them give encouragement to men of sense and knowledge to frequent their company and finally let them concur heartily in that union have projected betwixt the learned and conversible worlds they may perhaps meet with more complaisance from their usual followers than from men of learning but they cannot reasonably expect so sincere an affection and hope they will never be guilty of so wrong a choice as to sacrifice the substance to the shadow essay of moral prejudices there is a set of men lately sprung up amongst us who endeavour to distinguish themselves by ridiculing every thing that has hitherto appeard sacred and venerable in the eyes of mankind reason sobriety honour friendship marriage are the perpetual subjects of their insipid raillery and even public spirit and a regard to our country are treated as chimerical and romantic were the schemes of these antireformers to take place all the bonds of society must be broke to make way for the indulgence of a licentious mirth and gaiety the companion of our drunken frollics must be preferd to a friend or brother dissolute prodigality must be supplyd at the expence of every thing valuable either in public or private and men shall have so little regard to any thing beyond themselves that at last a free constitution of government must become a scheme perfectly impracticable among mankind and must degenerate into one universal system of fraud and corruption there is another humour which may be observd in some pretenders to wisdom and which if not so pernicious as the idle petulant humour abovementiond must however have a very bad effect on those who indulge it mean that grave philosophic endeavour after perfection which under pretext of reforming prejudices and errors strikes at all the most endearing sentiments of the heart and all the most useful byasses and instincts which can govern a human creature the stoics were remarkable for this folly among the antients and wish some of more venerable characters in latter times had not copyd them too faithfully in this particular the virtuous and tender sentiments or prejudices if you will have sufferd mightily by these reflections while a certain sullen pride or contempt of mankind has prevaild in their stead and has been esteemd the greatest wisdom tho in reality it be the most egregious folly of all others statilius being sollicited by brutus to make one of that noble band who struck the godlike stroke for the liberty of rome refusd to accompany them saying that all men were fools or mad and did not deserve that a wise man should trouble his head about them my learned reader will here easily recollect the reason which an antient philosopher gave why he woud not be reconcild to his brother who sollicited his friendship he was too much a philosopher to think that the connexion of having sprung from the same parent ought to have any influence on a reasonable mind and exprest his sentiment after such a manner as think not proper to repeat when your friend is in affliction says epictetus you may counterfeit a sympathy with him if it give him relief but take care not to allow any compassion to sink into your heart or disturb that tranquillity which is the perfection of wisdomdiogenes being askt by his friends in his sickness what should be done with him after his death why says he throw me out into the fields what replyd they to the birds or beasts no place a cudgel by me to defend myself withal to what purpose say they you will not have any sense nor any power of making use of it then if the beasts shoud devour me cries he shall be any more sensible of it know none of the sayings of that philosopher which shews more evidently both the liveliness and ferocity of his temper how different from these are the maxims by which eugenius conducts himself in his youth he applyd himself with the most unwearied labour to the study of philosophy and nothing was ever able to draw him from it except when an opportunity offerd of serving his friends or doing a pleasure to some man of merit when he was about thirty years of age he was determind to quit the free life of a batchelor in which otherwise he woud have been inclind to remain by considering that he was the last branch of an antient family which must have been extinguishd had he died without children he made choice of the virtuous and beautiful emira for his consort who after being the solace of his life for many years and having made him the father of several children paid at last the general debt to nature nothing coud have supported him under so severe an affliction but the consolation he receivd from his young family who were now become dearer to him on account of their deceast mother one daughter in particular is his darling and the secret joy of his soul because her features her air her voice recal every moment the tender memory of his spouse and fill his eyes with tears he conceals this partiality as much as possible and none but his intimate friends are acquainted with it to them he reveals all his tenderness nor is he so affectedly philosophical as even to call it by the name of weakness they know that he still keeps the birthday of emira with tears and a more fond and tender recollection of past pleasures in like manner as it was celebrated in her lifetime with joy and festivity they know that he preserves her picture with the utmost care and has one picture in miniature which he always wears next to his bosom that he has left orders in his last will that in whatever part of the world he shall happen to die his body shall be transported and laid in the same grave with hers and that a monument shall be erected over them and their mutual love and happiness celebrated in an epitaph which he himself has composd for that purpose a few years ago receivd a letter from a friend who was abroad on his travels and shall here communicate it to the public it contains such an instance of a philosophic spirit as think pretty extraordinary and may serve as an example not to depart too far from the receivd maxims of conduct and behaviour by a refind search after happiness or perfection the story have been since assurd of as matter of fact parisaug sir know you are more curious of accounts of men than of buildings and are more desirous of being informd of private history than of public transactions for which reason thought the following story which is the common topic of conversation in this city woud be no unacceptable entertainment to you a young lady of birth and fortune being left intirely at her own disposal persisted long in a resolution of leading a single life notwithstanding several advantageous offers that had been made to her she had been determind to embrace this resolution by observing the many unhappy marriages among her acquaintance and by hearing the complaints which her female friends made of the tyranny inconstancy jealousy or indifference of their husbands being a woman of strong spirit and an uncommon way of thinking she found no difficulty either in forming or maintaining this resolution and coud not suspect herself of such weakness as ever to be inducd by any temptation to depart from it she had however entertaind a strong desire of having a son whose education she was resolvd to make the principal concern of her life and by that means supply the place of those other passions which she was resolvd for ever to renounce she pushd her philosophy to such an uncommon length as to find no contradiction betwixt such a desire and her former resolution and accordingly lookd about with great deliberation to find among all her maleacquaintance one whose character and person were agreeable to her without being able to satisfy herself on that head at length being in the playhouse one evening she sees in the parterre a young man of a most engaging countenance and modest deportment and feels such a prepossession in his favour that she had hopes this must be the person she had long sought for in vain she immediately dispatches a servant to him desiring his company at her lodgings next morning the young man was overjoyd at the message and coud not command his satisfaction upon receiving such an advance from a lady of so great beauty reputation and quality he was therefore much disappointed when he found a woman who woud allow him no freedoms and amidst all her obliging behaviour confind and overawd him to the bounds of rational discourse and conversation she seemd however willing to commence a friendship with him and told him that his company woud always be acceptable to her whenever he had a leisure hour to bestow he needed not much entreaty to renew his visits being so struck with her wit and beauty that he must have been unhappy had he been debarrd her company every conversation servd only the more to inflame his passion and gave him more occasion to admire her person and understanding as well as to rejoice in his own goodfortune he was not however without anxiety when he considerd the disproportion of their birth and fortune nor was his uneasiness allayd even when he reflected on the extraordinary manner in which their acquaintance had commencd our philosophical heroine in the mean time discoverd that her lovers personal qualities did not belye his phisiognomy so that judging there was no occasion for any farther trial she takes a proper opportunity of communicating to him her whole intention their intercourse continud for sometime till at last her wishes were crownd and she was now mother of a boy who was to be the object of her future care and concern gladly woud she have continud her friendship with the father but finding him too passionate a lover to remain within the bounds of friendship she was obligd to put a violence upon herself she sends him a letter in which she had inclosd a bond of annuity for a thousand crowns desiring him at the same time never to see her more and to forget if possible all past favours and familiarities he was thunderstruck at receiving this message and having tried in vain all the arts that might win upon the resolution of a woman resolvd at last to attack her by her foible he commences a lawsuit against her before the parliament of paris and claims his son whom he pretends a right to educate as he pleasd according to the usual maxims of the law in such cases she pleads on the other hand their express agreement before their commerce and pretends that he had renouncd all claim to any offspring that might arise from their embraces it is not yet known how the parliament will determine in this extraordinary case which puzzles all the lawyers as much as it does the philosophers as soon as they come to any issue shall inform you of it and shall embrace any opportunity of subscribing myself as do at present sir your most humble servant essay of the middle station of life the moral of the following fable will easily discover itself without my explaining it one rivulet meeting another with whom he had been long united in strictest amity with noisy haughtiness and disdain thus bespoke him what brother still in the same state still low and creeping are you not ashamd when you behold me who tho lately in a like condition with you am now become a great river and shall shortly be able to rival the danube or the rhine provided those friendly rains continue which have favourd my banks but neglected yours very true replies the humble rivulet you are now indeed swoln to great size but methinks you are become withal somewhat turbulent and muddy am contented with my low condition and my purity instead of commenting upon this fable shall take occasion from it to compare the different stations of life and to perswade such of my readers as are placd in the middle station to be satisfyd with it as the most eligible of all others these form the most numerous rank of men that can be supposd susceptible of philosophy and therefore all discourses of morality ought principally to be addressd to them the great are too much immersd in pleasure and the poor too much occupyd in providing for the necessities of life to hearken to the calm voice of reason the middle station as it is most happy in many respects so particularly in this that a man placd in it can with the greatest leisure consider his own happiness and reap a new enjoyment from comparing his situation with that of persons above or below him agurs prayer is sufficiently noted two things have requird of thee deny me them not before die remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me lest be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain the middle station is here justly recommended as affording the fullest security for virtue and may also add that it gives opportunity for the most ample exercise of it and furnishes employment for every good quality which we can possibly be possest of those who are placd among the lower rank of men have little opportunity of exerting any other virtue besides those of patience resignation industry and integrity those who are advancd into the higher stations have full employment for their generosity humanity affability and charity when a man lyes betwixt these two extremes he can exert the former virtues towards his superiors and the latter towards his inferiors every moral quality which the human soul is susceptible of may have its turn and be called up to action and a man may after this manner be much more certain of his progress in virtue than where his good qualities lye dormant and without employment but there is another virtue that seems principally to ly among equals and is for that reason chiefly calculated for the middle station of life this virtue is friendship believe most men of generous tempers are apt to envy the great when they consider the large opportunities such persons have of doing good to their fellowcreatures and of acquiring the friendship and esteem of men of merit they make no advances in vain and are not obligd to associate with those whom they have little kindness for like people of inferior stations who are subject to have their proffers of friendship rejected even where they woud be most fond of placing their affections but tho the great have more facility in acquiring friendships they cannot be so certain of the sincerity of them as men of a lower rank since the favours they bestow may acquire them flattery instead of goodwill and kindness it has been very judiciously remarkd that we attach ourselves more by the services we perform than by those we receive and that a man is in danger of losing his friends by obliging them too far shoud therefore chuse to ly in the middle way and to have my commerce with my friend varied both by obligations given and receivd have too much pride to be willing that all the obligations should ly on my side and shoud be afraid that if they all lay on his he woud also have too much pride to be entirely easy under them or have a perfect complacency in my company we may also remark of the middle station of life that it is more favourable to the acquiring of wisdom and ability as well as of virtue and that a man so situate has a better chance for attaining a knowledge both of men and things than those of a more elevated station he enters with more familiarity into human life every thing appears in its natural colours before him he has more leisure to form observations and has beside the motive of ambition to push him on in his attainments being certain that he can never rise to any distinction or eminence in the world without his own industry and here cannot forbear communicating a remark which may appear somewhat extraordinary viz that tis wisely ordaind by providence that the middle station shoud be the most favourable to the improving our natural abilities since there is really more capacity requisite to perform the duties of that station than is requisite to act in the higher spheres of life there are more natural parts and a stronger genius requisite to make a good lawyer or physician than to make a great monarch for let us take any race or succession of kings where birth alone gives a title to the crown the english kings for instance who have not been esteemed the most shining in history from the conquest to the succession of his present majesty we may reckon twenty eight sovereigns omitting those who died minors of these eight are esteemd princes of great capacity viz the conquerorharry iiedward iedward harry and elisabeth and the late king william now believe every one will allow that in the common run of mankind there are not eight out of twenty eight who are fitted by nature to make a figure either on the bench or at the bar since charles ten monarchs have reignd in france omitting francis five of these have been esteemd princes of capacity viz loüis and francis and harry in short the governing of mankind well requires a great deal of virtue justice and humanity but not a surprising capacity a certain pope whose name have forgot usd to say let us divert ourselves my friends the world governs itself there are indeed some critical times such as those in which harry livd that call for the utmost vigour and a less courage and capacity than what appeard in that great monarch must have sunk under the weight but such circumstances are rare and even then fortune does at least one half of the business since the common professions such as law or physic require equal if not superior capacity to what are exerted in the higher spheres of life tis evident that the soul must be made of still a finer mold to shine in philosophy or poetry or in any of the higher parts of learning courage and resolution are chiefly requisite in a commander justice and humanity in a statesman but genius and capacity in a scholar great generals and great politicians are found in all ages and countries of the world and frequently start up at once even amongst the greatest barbarians sweden was sunk in ignorance when it producd gustavus ericson and gustavus adolphusmuscovy when the czar appeard and perhaps carthage when it gave birth to hannibal but england must pass thro a long gradation of its spencersjohnsonswallers drydens before it arrive at an addison or a pope a happy talent for the liberal arts and sciences is a kind of prodigy among men nature must afford the richest genius that comes from her hands education and example must cultivate it from the earliest infancy and industry must concur to carry it to any degree of perfection no man needs be surprised to see koulikan among the persians but homer in so early an age among the greeks is certainly matter of the highest wonder a man cannot show a genius for war who is not so fortunate as to be trusted with command and it seldom happens in any state or kingdom that several at once are placd in that situation how many marlboroughs were there in the confederate army who never rose so much as to the command of a regiment but am perswaded there has been but one milton in england within these hundred years because every one may exert the talents for poetry who is possest of them and no one coud exert them under greater disadvantages than that divine poet if no man were allowd to write verses but who was beforehand namd to be laureat coud we expect a poet in ten thousand years were we to distinguish the ranks of men by their genius and capacity more than by their virtue and usefulness to the public great philosophers woud certainly challenge the first rank and must be placd at the top of human kind so rare is this character that perhaps there has not as yet been above two in the world who can lay a just claim to it at least galilæo and newton seem to me so far to excel all the rest that cannot admit any other into the same class with them great poets may challenge the second place and this species of genius tho rare is yet much more frequent than the former of the greek poets that remain homer alone seems to merit this character of the romans virgil horace and lucretius of the english milton and pope corneille racine boileau and voltaire of the french and tasso and ariosto of the italians great orators and historians are perhaps more rare than great poets but as the opportunities for exerting the talents requisite for eloquence or acquiring the knowledge requisite for writing history depend in some measure upon fortune we cannot pronounce these productions of genius to be more extraordinary than the former should now return from this digression and show that the middle station of life is more favourable to happiness as well as to virtue and wisdom but as the arguments that prove this seem pretty obvious shall here forbear insisting on them essay of impudence and modesty am of opinion that the common complaints against providence are illgrounded and that the good or bad qualities of men are the causes of their good or bad fortune more than what is generally imagined there are no doubt instances to the contrary and these too pretty numerous but few in comparison of the instances we have of a right distribution of prosperity and adversity nor indeed could it be otherwise from the common course of human affairs to be endowed with a benevolent disposition and to love others will almost infallibly procure love and esteem which is the chief circumstance in life and facilitates every enterprize and undertaking besides the satisfaction which immediately results from it the case is much the same with the other virtues prosperity is naturally though not necessarily attached to virtue and merit and adversity in like manner to vice and folly must however confess that this rule admits of an exception with regard to one moral quality and that modesty has a natural tendency to conceal a mans talents as impudence displays them to the utmost and has been the only cause why many have risen in the world under all the disadvantages of low birth and little merit such indolence and incapacity is there in the generality of mankind that they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has a mind to put himself off for and admit his overbearing airs as proofs of that merit which he assumes to himself a decent assurance seems to be the natural attendant of virtue and few men can distinguish impudence from it as on the other hand diffidence being the natural result of vice and folly has drawn disgrace upon modesty which in outward appearance so nearly resembles ita as impudence though really a vice has the same effects upon a mans fortune as if it were a virtue so we may observe that it is almost as difficult to be attained and is in that respect distinguished from all the other vices which are acquired with little pains and continually encrease upon indulgence many a man being sensible that modesty is extremely prejudicial to him in making his fortune has resolved to be impudent and to put a bold face upon the matter but it is observable that such people have seldom succeeded in the attempt but have been obliged to relapse into their primitive modesty nothing carries a man through the world like a true genuine natural impudence its counterfeit is good for nothing nor can ever support itself in any other attempt whatever faults a man commits and is sensible of he is so much the nearer his end but when he endeavours at impudence if he ever failed in the attempt the remembrance of that failure will make him blush and will infallibly disconcert him after which every blush is a cause for new blushes till he be found out to be an arrant cheat and a vain pretender to impudence if any thing can give a modest man more assurance it must be some advantages of fortune which chance procures to him riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world and give merit a double lustre when a person is endowed with it and supply its place in a great measure when it is absent it is wonderful to observe what airs of superiority fools and knaves with large possessions give themselves above men of the greatest merit in poverty nor do the men of merit make any strong opposition to these usurpations or rather seem to favour them by the modesty of their behaviour their good sense and experience make them diffident of their judgment and cause them to examine every thing with the greatest accuracy as on the other hand the delicacy of their sentiments makes them timorous lest they commit faults and lose in the practice of the world that integrity of virtue so to speak of which they are so jealous to make wisdom agree with confidence is as difficult as to reconcile vice and modesty these are the reflections which have occurred upon this subject of impudence and modesty and hope the reader will not be displeased to see them wrought into the following allegory jupiter in the beginning joined virtue wisdom and confidence together and vice folly and diffidence and thus connected sent them into the world but though he thought he had matched them with great judgment and said that confidence was the natural companion of virtue and that vice deserved to be attended with diffidence they had not gone far before dissension arose among them wisdom who was the guide of the one company was always accustomed before she ventured upon any road however beaten to examine it carefully to enquire whither it led what dangers difficulties and hindrances might possibly or probably occur in it in these deliberations she usually consumed some time which delay was very displeasing to confidence who was always inclined to hurry on without much forethought or deliberation in the first road he met wisdom and virtue were inseparable but confidence one day following his impetuous nature advanced a considerable way before his guides and companions and not feeling any want of their company he never enquired after them nor ever met with them more in like manner the other society though joined by jupiter disagreed and separated as folly saw very little way before her she had nothing to determine concerning the goodness of roads nor could give the preference to one above another and this want of resolution was encreased by diffidence who with her doubts and scruples always retarded the journey this was a great annoyance to vice who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays and was never satisfied without his full career in whatever his inclinations led him to folly he knew though she harkened to diffidence would be easily managed when alone and therefore as a vicious horse throws his rider he openly beat away this controller of all his pleasures and proceeded in his journey with folly from whom he is inseparable confidence and diffidence being after this manner both thrown loose from their respective companies wandered for some time till at last chance led them at the same time to one village confidence went directly up to the great house which belonged to wealth the lord of the village and without staying for a porter intruded himself immediately into the innermost apartments where he found vice and folly well received before him he joined the train recommended himself very quickly to his landlord and entered into such familiarity with vice that he was enlisted in the same company with folly they were frequent guests of wealth and from that moment inseparable diffidence in the mean time not daring to approach the great house accepted of an invitation from poverty one of the tenants and entering the cottage found wisdom and virtue who being repulsed by the landlord had retired thither virtue took compassion of her and wisdom found from her temper that she would easily improve so they admitted her into their society accordingly by their means she altered in a little time somewhat of her manner and becoming much more amiable and engaging was now known by the name of modesty as ill company has a greater effect than good confidence though more refractory to counsel and example degenerated so far by the society of vice and folly as to pass by the name of impudence mankind who saw these societies as jupiter first joined them and know nothing of these mutual desertions are thereby led into strange mistakes and wherever they see impudence make account of finding virtue and wisdom and wherever they observe modesty call her attendants vice and folly essay of love and marriage know not whence it proceeds that women are so apt to take amiss every thing which is said in disparagement of the married state and always consider a satyr upon matrimony as a satyr upon themselves do they mean that they are the parties principally concerned and that if a backwardness to enter into that state should prevail in the world they would be the greatest sufferers or are they sensible that the misfortunes and miscarriages of the married state are owing more to their sex than to ours hope they do not intend to confess either of these two particulars or to give such an advantage to their adversaries the men as even to allow them to suspect it have often had thoughts of complying with this humour of the fair sex and of writing a panegyric upon marriage but in looking around for materials they seemed to be of so mixed a nature that at the conclusion of my reflections found that was as much disposed to write a satyr which might be placed on the opposite pages of the panegyric and am afraid that as satyr is on most occasions thought to contain more truth than panegyric should have done their cause more harm than good by this expedient to misrepresent facts is what know they will not require of me must be more a friend to truth than even to them where their interests are opposite shall tell the women what it is our sex complains of most in the married state and if they be disposed to satisfy us in this particular all the other differences will easily be accommodated if be not mistaken tis their love of dominion which is the ground of the quarrel tho tis very likely that they will think it an unreasonable love of it in us which makes us insist so much upon that point however this may be no passion seems to have more influence on female minds than this for power and there is a remarkable instance in history of its prevailing above another passion which is the only one that can be supposed a proper counterpoise for it we are told that all the women in scythia once conspired against the men and kept the secret so well that they executed their design before they were suspected they surprised the men in drink or asleep bound them all fast in chains and having called a solemn council of the whole sex it was debated what expedient should be used to improve the present advantage and prevent their falling again into slavery to kill all the men did not seem to the relish of any part of the assembly notwithstanding the injuries formerly received and they were afterwards pleased to make a great merit of this lenity of theirs it was therefore agreed to put out the eyes of the whole male sex and thereby resign in all future time the vanity which they could draw from their beauty in order to secure their authority we must no longer pretend to dress and show say they but then we shall be free from slavery we shall hear no more tender sighs but in return we shall hear no more imperious commands love must for ever leave us but he will carry subjection along with him tis regarded by some as an unlucky circumstance since the women were resolved to maim the men and deprive them of some of their senses in order to render them humble and dependent that the sense of hearing could not serve their purpose since tis probable the females would rather have attacked that than the sight and think it is agreed among the learned that in a married state tis not near so great an inconvenience to lose the former sense as the latter however this may be we are told by modern anecdotes that some of the scythian women did secretly spare their husbands eyes presuming suppose that they could govern them as well by means of that sense as without it but so incorrigible and untractable were these men that their wives were all obliged in a few years as their youth and beauty decayed to imitate the example of their sisters which it was no difficult matter to do in a state where the female sex had once got the superiority know not if our scottish ladies derive any thing of this humour from their scythian ancestors but must confess that have often been surprized to see a woman very well pleased to take a fool for her mate that she might govern with the less controul and could not but think her sentiments in this respect still more barbarous than those of the scythian women abovementioned as much as the eyes of the understanding are more valuable than those of the body but to be just and to lay the blame more equally am afraid it is the fault of our sex if the women be so fond of rule and that if we did not abuse our authority they would never think it worth while to dispute it tyrants we know produce rebels and all history informs us that rebels when they prevail are apt to become tyrants in their turn for this reason could wish there were no pretensions to authority on either side but that every thing was carried on with perfect equality as between two equal members of the same body and to induce both parties to embrace those amicable sentiments shall deliver to them platos account of the origin of love and marriage mankind according to that fanciful philosopher were not in their original divided into male and female as at present but each individual person was a compound of both sexes and was in himself both husband and wife melted down into one living creature this union no doubt was very intire and the parts very well adjusted together since there resulted a perfect harmony betwixt the male and female altho they were obliged to be inseparable companions and so great were the harmony and happiness flowing from it that the androgynes for so plato calls them or menwomen became insolent upon their prosperity and rebelled against the gods to punish them for this temerity jupiter could contrive no better expedient than to divorce the malepart from the female and make two imperfect beings of the compound which was before so perfect hence the origin of men and women as distinct creatures but notwithstanding this division so lively is our remembrance of the happiness which we enjoyed in our primæval state that we are never at rest in this situation but each of these halves is continually searching thro the whole species to find the other half which was broken from it and when they meet they join again with the greatest fondness and sympathy but it often happens that they are mistaken in this particular that they take for their half what no way corresponds to them and that the parts do not meet nor join in with each other as is usual in fractures in this case the union was soon dissolved and each part is set loose again to hunt for its lost half joining itself to every one whom it meets by way of trial and enjoying no rest till its perfect sympathy with its partner shews that it has at last been successful in its endeavours were disposed to carry on this fiction of plato which accounts for the mutual love betwixt the sexes in so agreeable a manner would do it by the following allegory when jupiter had separated the male from the female and had quelled their pride and ambition by so severe an operation he could not but repent him of the cruelty of his vengeance and take compassion on poor mortals who were now become incapable of any repose or tranquillity such cravings such anxieties such necessities arose as made them curse their creation and think existence itself a punishment in vain had they recourse to every other occupation and amusement in vain did they seek after every pleasure of sense and every refinement of reason nothing could fill that void which they felt in their hearts or supply the loss of their partner who was so fatally separated from them to remedy this disorder and to bestow some comfort at least on the human race in their forlorn situation jupiter sent down love and hymen to collect the broken halves of human kind and piece them together in the best manner possible these two deities found such a prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in their primæval state that they proceeded on their work with wonderful success for some time till at last from many unlucky accidents dissension arose betwixt them the chief counsellor and favourite of hymen was care who was continually filling his patrons head with prospects of futurity a settlement family children servants so that little else was regarded in all the matches they made on the other hand love had chosen pleasure for his favourite who was as pernicious a counsellor as the other and would never allow love to look beyond the present momentary gratification or the satisfying of the prevailing inclination these two favourites became in a little time irreconcileable enemies and made it their chief business to undermine each other in all their undertakings no sooner had love fixed upon two halves which he was cementing together and forming to a close union but care insinuates himself and bringing hymen along with him dissolves the union produced by love and joins each half to some other half which he had provided for it to be revenged of this pleasure creeps in upon a pair already joined by hymen and calling love to his assistance they under hand contrive to join each half by secret links to halves which hymen was wholly unacquainted with it was not long before this quarrel was felt in its pernicious consequences and such complaints arose before the throne of jupiter that he was obliged to summon the offending parties to appear before him in order to give an account of their proceedings after hearing the pleadings on both sides he ordered an immediate reconcilement betwixt love and hymen as the only expedient for giving happiness to mankind and that he might be sure this reconcilement should be durable he laid his strict injunctions on them never to join any halves without consulting their favourites care and pleasure and obtaining the consent of both to the conjunction where this order is strictly observed the androgyne is perfectly restored and the human race enjoy the same happiness as in their primæval state the seam is scarce perceived that joins the two beings but both of them combine to form one perfect and happy creature essay of the study of history there is nothing which would recommend more earnestly to my female readers than the study of history as an occupation of all others the best suited both to their sex and education much more instructive than their ordinary books of amusement and more entertaining than those serious compositions which are usually to be found in their closets among other important truths which they may learn from history they may be informed of two particulars the knowledge of which may contribute very much to their quiet and repose that our sex as well as theirs are far from being such perfect creatures as they are apt to imagine and that love is not the only passion which governs the maleworld but is often overcome by avarice ambition vanity and a thousand other passions whether they be the false representations of mankind in those two particulars which endear romances and novels so much to the fair sex know not but must confess that am sorry to see them have such an aversion to matter of fact and such an appetite for falshood remember was once desired by a young beauty for whom had some passion to send her some novels and romances for her amusement in the country but was not so ungenerous as to take the advantage which such a course of reading might have given me being resolved not to make use of poisoned arms against her therefore sent her plutarchs lives assuring her at the same time that there was not a word of truth in them from beginning to end she perused them very attentively till she came to the lives of alexander and cæsar whose names she had heard of by accident and then returned me the book with many reproaches for deceiving her may indeed be told that the fair sex have no such aversion to history as have represented provided it be secret history and contain some memorable transaction proper to excite their curiosity but as do not find that truth which is the basis of history is at all regarded in those anecdotes cannot admit of this as a proof of their passion for that study however this may be see not why the same curiosity might not receive a more proper direction and lead them to desire accounts of those who lived in past ages as well as of their cotemporaries what is it to cleora whether fulvia entertains a secret commerce of love with philander or not has she not equal reason to be pleased when she is informed what is whispered about among historians that catos sister had an intrigue with cæsar and palmed her son marcus brutus upon her husband for his own tho in reality he was her gallants and are not the loves of messalina or julia as proper subjects of discourse as any intrigue that this city has produced of late years but know not whence it comes that have been thus seduced into a kind of raillery against the ladies unless perhaps it proceed from the same cause which makes the person who is the favourite of the company be often the object of their goodnatured jests and pleasantries we are pleased to address ourselves after any manner to one who is agreeable to us and at the same time presume that nothing will be taken amiss by a person who is secure of the good opinion and affections of every one present shall now proceed to handle my subject more seriously and shall point out the many advantages which flow from the study of history and show how well suited it is to every one but particularly to those who are debarred the severer studies by the tenderness of their complexion and the weakness of their education the advantages found in history seem to be of three kinds as it amuses the fancy as it improves the understanding and as it strengthens virtue in reality what more agreeable entertainment to the mind than to be transported into the remotest ages of the world and to observe human society in its infancy making the first faint essays towards the arts and sciences to see the policy of government and the civility of conversation refining by degrees and every thing which is ornamental to human life advancing towards its perfection to remark the rise progress declension and final extinction of the most flourishing empires the virtues which contributed to their greatness and the vices which drew on their ruin in short to see all human race from the beginning of time pass as it were in review before us appearing in their true colours without any of those disguises which during their lifetime so much perplexed the judgment of the beholders what spectacle can be imagined so magnificent so various so interesting what amusement either of the senses or imagination can be compared with it shall those trifling pastimes which engross so much of our time be preferred as more satisfactory and more fit to engage our attention how perverse must that taste be which is capable of so wrong a choice of pleasures but history is a most improving part of knowledge as well as an agreeable amusement and a great part of what we commonly call erudition and value so highly is nothing but an acquaintance with historical facts an extensive knowledge of this kind belongs to men of letters but must think it an unpardonable ignorance in persons of whatever sex or condition not to be acquainted with the history of their own country together with the histories of ancient greece and rome a woman may behave herself with good manners and have even some vivacity in her turn of wit but where her mind is so unfurnished tis impossible her conversation can afford any entertainment to men of sense and reflection must add that history is not only a valuable part of knowledge but opens the door to many other parts and affords materials to most of the sciences and indeed if we consider the shortness of human life and our limited knowledge even of what passes in our own time we must be sensible that we should be for ever children in understanding were it not for this invention which extends our experience to all past ages and to the most distant nations making them contribute as much to our improvement in wisdom as if they had actually lain under our observation a man acquainted with history may in some respect be said to have lived from the beginning of the world and to have been making continual additions to his stock of knowledge in every century there is also an advantage in that experience which is acquired by history above what is learned by the practice of the world that it brings us acquainted with human affairs without diminishing in the least from the most delicate sentiments of virtue and to tell the truth know not any study or occupation so unexceptionable as history in this particular poets can paint virtue in the most charming colours but as they address themselves entirely to the passions they often become advocates for vice even philosophers are apt to bewilder themselves in the subtilty of their speculations and we have seen some go so far as to deny the reality of all moral distinctions but think it a remark worthy the attention of the speculative that the historians have been almost without exception the true friends of virtue and have always represented it in its proper colours however they may have erred in their judgments of particular persons machiavel himself discovers a true sentiment of virtue in his history of florence when he talks as a politician in his general reasonings he considers poisoning assassination and perjury as lawful arts of power but when he speaks as an historian in his particular narrations he shows so keen an indignation against vice and so warm an approbation of virtue in many passages that could not forbear applying to him that remark of horace that if you chace away nature tho with ever so great indignity she will always return upon you nor is this combination of historians in favour of virtue at all difficult to be accounted for when a man of business enters into life and action he is more apt to consider the characters of men as they have relation to his interest than as they stand in themselves and has his judgment warped on every occasion by the violence of his passion when a philosopher contemplates characters and manners in his closet the general abstract view of the objects leaves the mind so cold and unmoved that the sentiments of nature have no room to play and he scarce feels the difference between vice and virtue history keeps in a just medium betwixt these extremes and places the objects in their true point of view the writers of history as well as the readers are sufficiently interested in the characters and events to have a lively sentiment of blame or praise and at the same time have no particular interest or concern to pervert their judgment veræ voces tum demum pectore ab imo eliciuntur lucret a essay of avarice tis easy to observe that comic writers exaggerate every character and draw their fop or coward with stronger features than are any where to be met with in nature this moral kind of painting for the stage has been often compared to the painting for cupolas and cielings where the colours are overcharged and every part is drawn excessively large and beyond nature the figures seem monstrous and disproportioned when seen too nigh but become natural and regular when set at a distance and placed in that point of view in which they are intended to be surveyed for a like reason when characters are exhibited in theatrical representations the want of reality removes in a manner the personages and rendering them more cold and unentertaining makes it necessary to compensate by the force of colouring what they want in substance thus we find in common life that when a man once allows himself to depart from truth in his narrations he never can keep within the bounds of probability but adds still some new circumstance to render his stories more marvellous and to satisfy his imagination two men in buckram suits became eleven to sir john falstaff before the end of his story there is only one vice which may be found in life with as strong features and as high a colouring as needs be employed by any satyrist or comic poet and that is avarice every day we meet with men of immense fortunes without heirs and on the very brink of the grave who refuse themselves the most common necessaries of life and go on heaping possessions on possessions under all the real pressures of the severest poverty an old usurer says the story lying in his last agonies was presented by the priest with the crucifix to worship he opens his eyes a moment before he expires considers the crucifix and cries these jewels are not true can only lend ten pistoles upon such a pledge this was probably the invention of some epigrammatist and yet every one from his own experience may be able to recollect almost as strong instances of perseverance in avarice tis commonly reported of a famous miser in this city that finding himself near death he sent for some of the magistrates and gave them a bill of an hundred pounds payable after his decease which sum he intended should be disposed of in charitable uses but scarce were they gone when he orders them to be called back and offers them ready money if they would abate five pounds of the sum another noted miser in the north intending to defraud his heirs and leave his fortune to the building of an hospital protracted the drawing of his will from day to day and tis thought that if those interested in it had not paid for the drawing it he had died intestate in short none of the most furious excesses of love and ambition are in any respect to be compared to the extremes of avarice the best excuse that can be made for avarice is that it generally prevails in old men or in men of cold tempers where all the other affections are extinct and the mind being incapable of remaining without some passion or pursuit at last finds out this monstrously absurd one which suits the coldness and inactivity of its temper at the same time it seems very extraordinary that so frosty spiritless a passion should be able to carry us farther than all the warmth of youth and pleasure but if we look more narrowly into the matter we shall find that this very circumstance renders the explication of the case more easy when the temper is warm and full of vigour it naturally shoots out more ways than one and produces inferior passions to counterbalance in some degree its predominant inclination tis impossible for a person of that temper however bent on any pursuit to be deprived of all sense of shame or all regard to the sentiments of mankind his friends must have some influence over him and other considerations are apt to have their weight all this serves to restrain him within some bounds but tis no wonder that the avaritious man being from the coldness of his temper without regard to reputation to friendship or to pleasure should be carried so far by his prevailing inclination and should display his passion in such surprising instances accordingly we find no vice so irreclaimable as avarice and though there scarcely has been a moralist or philosopher from the beginning of the world to this day who has not levelled a stroke at it we hardly find a single instance of any persons being cured of it for this reason am more apt to approve of those who attack it with wit and humour than of those who treat it in a serious manner there being so little hopes of doing good to the people infected with this vice would have the rest of mankind at least diverted by our manner of exposing it as indeed there is no kind of diversion of which they seem so willing to partake among the fables of monsieur de lamotte there is one levelled against avarice which seems to me more natural and easy than most of the fables of that ingenious author a miser says he being dead and fairly interred came to the banks of the styx desiring to be ferried over along with the other ghosts charon demands his fare and is surprized to see the miser rather than pay it throw himself into the river and swim over to the other side notwithstanding all the clamour and opposition that could be made to him all hell was in an uproar and each of the judges was meditating some punishment suitable to a crime of such dangerous consequence to the infernal revenues shall he be chained to the rock with prometheus or tremble below the precipice in company with the danaides or assist sisyphus in rolling his stone no says minos none of these we must invent some severer punishment let him be sent back to the earth to see the use his heirs are making of his riches hope it will not be interpreted as a design of setting myself in opposition to this celebrated author if proceed to deliver a fable of my own which is intended to expose the same vice of avarice the hint of it was taken from these lines of mr pope damnd to the mines an equal fate betides the slave that digs it and the slave that hides our old mother earth once lodged an indictment against avarice before the courts of heaven for her wicked and malicious council and advice in tempting inducing persuading and traiterously seducing the children of the plaintiff to commit the detestable crime of parricide upon her and mangling her body ransack her very bowels for hidden treasure the indictment was very long and verbose but we must omit a great part of the repetitions and synonymous terms not to tire our readers too much with our tale avarice being called before jupiter to answer to this charge had not much to say in her own defence the injustice was clearly proved upon her the fact indeed was notorious and the injury had been frequently repeated when therefore the plaintiff demanded justice jupiter very readily gave sentence in her favour and his decree was to this purpose that since dame avarice the defendant had thus grievously injured dame earth the plaintiff she was hereby ordered to take that treasure of which she had feloniously robbed the said plaintiff by ransacking her bosom and in the same manner as before opening her bosom restore it back to her without diminution or retention from this sentence it shall follow says jupiter to the bystanders that in all future ages the retainers of avarice shall bury and conceal their riches and thereby restore to the earth what they took from her essay a character of sir robert walpole there never was a man whose actions and character have been more earnestly and openly canvassed than those of the present minister who having governed a learned and free nation for so long a time amidst such mighty opposition may make a large library of what has been wrote for and against him and is the subject of above half the paper that has been blotted in the nation within these twenty years wish for the honour of our country that any one character of him had been drawn with such judgment and impartiality as to have some credit with posterity and to shew that our liberty has once at least been employed to good purpose am only afraid of failing in the former quality of judgment but if it should be so tis but one page more thrown away after an hundred thousand upon the same subject that have perished and become useless in the mean time shall flatter myself with the pleasing imagination that the following character will be adopted by future historians sir robert walpole prime minister of great britain is a man of ability not a genius goodnatured not virtuous constant not magnanimous moderate not equitable his virtues in some instances are free from the allay of those vices which usually accompany such virtues he is a generous friend without being a bitter enemy his vices in other instances are not compensated by those virtues which are nearly allyed to them his want of enterprise is not attended with frugality the private character of the man is better than the public his virtues more than his vices his fortune greater than his fame with many good qualities he has incurred the public hatred with good capacity he has not escaped ridicule he would have been esteemed more worthy of his high station had he never possessed it and is better qualified for the second than for the first place in any government his ministry has been more advantageous to his family than to the public better for this age than for posterity and more pernicious by bad precedents than by real grievances during his time trade has flourished liberty declined and learning gone to ruin as am a man love him as am a scholar hate him as am a briton calmly wish his fall and were a member of either house would give my vote for removing him from st jamess but should be glad to see him retire to houghtonhall to pass the remainder of his days in ease and pleasure essay of suicide one considerable advantage that arises from philosophy consists in the sovereign antidote which it affords to superstition and false religion all other remedies against that pestilent distemper are vain or at least uncertain plain goodsense and the practice of the world which alone serve most purposes of life are here found ineffectual history as well as daily experience affords instances of men endowed with the strongest capacity for business and affairs who have all their lives crouched under slavery to the grossest superstition even gaiety and sweetness of temper which infuse a balm into every other wound afford no remedy to so virulent a poison as we may particularly observe of the fair sex who tho commonly possessed of these rich presents of nature feel many of their joys blasted by this importunate intruder but when sound philosophy has once gained possession of the mind superstition is effectually excluded and one may safely affirm that her triumph over this enemy is more compleat than over most of the vices and imperfections incident to human nature love or anger ambition or avarice have their root in the temper and affections which the soundest reason is scarce ever able fully to correct but superstition being founded on false opinion must immediately vanish when true philosophy has inspired juster sentiments of superior powers the contest is here more equal between the distemper and the medicine and nothing can hinder the latter from proving effectual but its being false and sophisticated it will here be superfluous to magnify the merits of philosophy by displaying the pernicious tendency of that vice of which it cures the human mind the superstitious man says tully is miserable in every scene in every incident of life even sleep itself which banishes all other cares of unhappy mortals affords to him matter of new terror while he examines his dreams and finds in those visions of the night prognostications of future calamities may add that tho death alone can put a full period to his misery he dares not fly to this refuge but still prolongs a miserable existence from a vain fear lest he offend his maker by using the power with which that beneficent being has endowed him the presents of god and nature are ravished from us by this cruel enemy and notwithstanding that one step would remove us from the regions of pain and sorrow her menaces still chain us down to a hated being which she herself chiefly contributes to render miserable it is observed of such as have been reduced by the calamities of life to the necessity of employing this fatal remedy that if the unseasonable care of their friends deprive them of that species of death which they proposed to themselves they seldom venture upon any other or can summon up so much resolution a second time as to execute their purpose so great is our horror of death that when it presents itself under any form besides that to which a man has endeavoured to reconcile his imagination it acquires new terrors and overcomes his feeble courage but when the menaces of superstition are joined to this natural timidity no wonder it quite deprives men of all power over their lives since even many pleasures and enjoyments to which we are carried by a strong propensity are torn from us by this inhuman tyrant let us here endeavour to restore men to their native liberty by examining all the common arguments against suicide and shewing that that action may be free from every imputation of guilt or blame according to the sentiments of all the antient philosophers if suicide be criminal it must be a transgression of our duty either to god our neighbour or ourselves to prove that suicide is no transgression of our duty to god the following considerations may perhaps suffice in order to govern the material world the almighty creator has established general and immutable laws by which all bodies from the greatest planet to the smallest particle of matter are maintained in their proper sphere and function to govern the animal world he has endowed all living creatures with bodily and mental powers with senses passions appetites memory and judgment by which they are impelled or regulated in that course of life to which they are destined these two distinct principles of the material and animal world continually encroach upon each other and mutually retard or forward each others operation the powers of men and of all other animals are restrained and directed by the nature and qualities of the surrounding bodies and the modifications and actions of these bodies are incessantly altered by the operation of all animals man is stopped by rivers in his passage over the surface of the earth and rivers when properly directed lend their force to the motion of machines which serve to the use of man but tho the provinces of the material and animal powers are not kept entirely separate there result from thence no discord or disorder in the creation on the contrary from the mixture union and contrast of all the various powers of inanimate bodies and living creatures arises that surprizing harmony and proportion which affords the surest argument of supreme wisdom the providence of the deity appears not immediately in any operation but governs every thing by those general and immutable laws which have been established from the beginning of time all events in one sense may be pronounced the action of the almighty they all proceed from those powers with which he has endowed his creatures a house which falls by its own weight is not brought to ruin by his providence more than one destroyed by the hands of men nor are the human faculties less his workmanship than the laws of motion and gravitation when the passions play when the judgment dictates when the limbs obey this is all the operation of god and upon these animate principles as well as upon the inanimate has he established the government of the universe every event is alike important in the eyes of that infinite being who takes in at one glance the most distant regions of space and remotest periods of time there is no one event however important to us which he has exempted from the general laws that govern the universe or which he has peculiarly reserved for his own immediate action and operation the revolutions of states and empires depend upon the smallest caprice or passion of single men and the lives of men are shortened or extended by the smallest accident of air or diet sunshine or tempest nature still continues her progress and operation and if general laws be ever broke by particular volitions of the deity tis after a manner which entirely escapes human observation as on the one hand the elements and other inanimate parts of the creation carry on their action without regard to the particular interest and situation of men so men are entrusted to their own judgment and discretion in the various shocks of matter and may employ every faculty with which they are endowed in order to provide for their ease happiness or preservation what is the meaning then of that principle that a man who tired of life and hunted by pain and misery bravely overcomes all the natural terrors of death and makes his escape from this cruel scene that such a man say has incurred the indignation of his creator by encroaching on the office of divine providence and disturbing the order of the universe shall we assert that the almighty has reserved to himself in any peculiar manner the disposal of the lives of men and has not submitted that event in common with others to the general laws by which the universe is governed this is plainly false the lives of men depend upon the same laws as the lives of all other animals and these are subjected to the general laws of matter and motion the fall of a tower or the infusion of a poison will destroy a man equally with the meanest creature an inundation sweeps away every thing without distinction that comes within the reach of its fury since therefore the lives of men are for ever dependent on the general laws of matter and motion is a mans disposing of his life criminal because in every case it is criminal to encroach upon these laws or disturb their operation but this seems absurd all animals are entrusted to their own prudence and skill for their conduct in the world and have full authority as far as their power extends to alter all the operations of nature without the exercise of this authority they could not subsist a moment every action every motion of a man innovates in the order of some parts of matter and diverts from their ordinary course the general laws of motion putting together therefore these conclusions we find that human life depends upon the general laws of matter and motion and that tis no encroachment on the office of providence to disturb or alter these general laws has not every one of consequence the free disposal of his own life and may he not lawfully employ that power with which nature has endowed him in order to destroy the evidence of this conclusion we must shew a reason why this particular case is excepted is it because human life is of so great importance that it is a presumption for human prudence to dispose of it but the life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster and were it of ever so great importance the order of nature has actually submitted it to human prudence and reduced us to a necessity in every incident of determining concerning it were the disposal of human life so much reserved as the peculiar province of the almighty that it were an encroachment on his right for men to dispose of their own lives it would be equally criminal to act for the preservation of life as for its destruction if turn aside a stone which is falling upon my head disturb the course of nature and invade the peculiar province of the almighty by lengthening out my life beyond the period which by the general laws of matter and motion he had assigned to it a hair a fly an insect is able to destroy this mighty being whose life is of such importance is it an absurdity to suppose that human prudence may lawfully dispose of what depends on such insignificant causes it would be no crime in me to divert the nile or danube from its course were able to effect such purposes where then is the crime of turning a few ounces of blood from their natural chanels do you imagine that repine at providence or curse my creation because go out of life and put a period to a being which were it to continue would render me miserable far be such sentiments from me am only convinced of a matter of fact which you yourself acknowledge possible that human life may be unhappy and that my existence if farther prolonged would become uneligible but thank providence both for the good which have already enjoyed and for the power with which am endowed of escaping the ill that threatens me to you it belongs to repine at providence who foolishly imagine that you have no such power and who must still prolong a hated being tho loaded with pain and sickness with shame and poverty do you not teach that when any ill befalls me tho by the malice of my enemies ought to be resigned to providence and that the actions of men are the operations of the almighty as much as the actions of inanimate beings when fall upon my own sword therefore receive my death equally from the hands of the deity as if it had proceeded from a lion a precipice or a fever the submission which you require to providence in every calamity that befalls me excludes not human skill and industry if possibly by their means can avoid or escape the calamity and why may not employ one remedy as well as another if my life be not my own it were criminal for me to put it in danger as well as to dispose of it nor could one man deserve the appellation of hero whom glory or friendship transports into the greatest dangers and another merit the reproach of wretch or miscreant who puts a period to his life from the same or like motives there is no being which possesses any power or faculty that it receives not from its creator nor is there any one which by ever so irregular an action can encroach upon the plan of his providence or disorder the universe its operations are his work equally with that chain of events which it invades and which ever principle prevails we may for that very reason conclude it to be most favoured by him be it animate or inanimate rational or irrational tis all a case its power is still derived from the supreme creator and is alike comprehended in the order of his providence when the horror of pain prevails over the love of life when a voluntary action anticipates the effect of blind causes it is only in consequence of those powers and principles which he has implanted in his creatures divine providence is still inviolate and placed far beyond the reach of human injuries it is impious says the old roman superstition to divert rivers from their course or invade the prerogatives of nature tis impious says the french superstition to inoculate for the smallpox or usurp the business of providence by voluntarily producing distempers and maladies tis impious says the modern european superstition to put a period to our own life and thereby rebel against our creator and why not impious say to build houses cultivate the ground and sail upon the ocean in all these actions we employ our powers of mind and body to produce some innovation in the course of nature and in none of them do we any more they are all of them therefore equally innocent or equally criminal but you are placed by providence like a sentinel in a particular station and when you desert it without being recalled you are guilty of rebellion against your almighty sovereign and have incurred his displeasure ask why do you conclude that providence has placed me in this station for my part find that owe my birth to a long chain of causes of which many and even the principal depended upon voluntary actions of men but providence guided all these causes and nothing happens in the universe without its consent and cooperation if so then neither does my death however voluntary happen without its consent and whenever pain and sorrow so far overcome my patience as to make me tired of life may conclude that am recalled from my station in the clearest and most express terms it is providence surely that has placed me at present in this chamber but may not leave it when think proper without being liable to the imputation of having deserted my post or station when shall be dead the principles of which am composed will still perform their part in the universe and will be equally useful in the grand fabric as when they composed this individual creature the difference to the whole will be no greater than between my being in a chamber and in the open air the one change is of more importance to me than the other but not more so to the universe it is a kind of blasphemy to imagine that any created being can disturb the order of the world or invade the business of providence it supposes that that being possesses powers and faculties which it received not from its creator and which are not subordinate to his government and authority a man may disturb society no doubt and thereby incur the displeasure of the almighty but the government of the world is placed far beyond his reach and violence and how does it appear that the almighty is displeased with those actions that disturb society by the principles which he has implanted in human nature and which inspire us with a sentiment of remorse if we ourselves have been guilty of such actions and with that of blame and disapprobation if we ever observe them in others let us now examine according to the method proposed whether suicide be of this kind of actions and be a breach of our duty to our neighbour and to society a man who retires from life does no harm to society he only ceases to do good which if it be an injury is of the lowest kind all our obligations to do good to society seem to imply something reciprocal receive the benefits of society and therefore ought to promote its interest but when withdraw myself altogether from society can be bound any longer but allowing that our obligations to do good were perpetual they have certainly some bounds am not obliged to do a small good to society at the expence of a great harm to myself why then should prolong a miserable existence because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me if upon account of age and infirmities may lawfully resign any office and employ my time altogether in fencing against these calamities and alleviating as much as possible the miseries of my future life why may not cut short these miseries at once by an action which is no more prejudicial to society but suppose that it is no longer in my power to promote the interest of the public suppose that am a burthen to it suppose that my life hinders some person from being much more useful to the public in such cases my resignation of life must not only be innocent but laudable and most people who lie under any temptation to abandon existence are in some such situation those who have health or power or authority have commonly better reason to be in humour with the world a man is engaged in a conspiracy for the public interest is seized upon suspicion is threatened with the rack and knows from his own weakness that the secret will be extorted from him could such a one consult the public interest better than by putting a quick period to a miserable life this was the case of the famous and brave strozzi of florence again suppose a malefactor justly condemned to a shameful death can any reason be imagined why he may not anticipate his punishment and save himself all the anguish of thinking on its dreadful approaches he invades the business of providence no more than the magistrate did who ordered his execution and his voluntary death is equally advantageous to society by ridding it of a pernicious member that suicide may often be consistent with interest and with our duty to ourselves no one can question who allows that age sickness or misfortune may render life a burthen and make it worse even than annihilation believe that no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping for such is our natural horror of death that small motives will never be able to reconcile us to it and tho perhaps the situation of a mans health or fortune did not seem to require this remedy we may at least be assured that any one who without apparent reason has had recourse to it was curst with such an incurable depravity or gloominess of temper as must poison all enjoyment and render him equally miserable as if he had been loaded with the most grievous misfortunes if suicide be supposed a crime tis only cowardice can impel us to it if it be no crime both prudence and courage should engage us to rid ourselves at once of existence when it becomes a burthen tis the only way that we can then be useful to society by setting an example which if imitated would preserve to every one his chance for happiness in life and would effectually free him from all danger of misery essay of the immortality of the soul by the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the immortality of the soul the arguments for it are commonly derived either from metaphysical topics or moral or physical but in reality it is the gospel and the gospel alone that has brought life and immortality to light metaphysical topics are founded on the supposition that the soul is immaterial and that it is impossible for thought to belong to a material substance but just metaphysics teach us that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imperfect and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities inhering in an unknown something matter therefore and spirit are at bottom equally unknown and we cannot determine what qualities may inhere in the one or in the other they likewise teach us that nothing can be decided a priori concerning any cause or effect and that experience being the only source of our judgments of this nature we cannot know from any other principle whether matter by its structure or arrangement may not be the cause of thought abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence but admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe like the etherial fire of the stoics and to be the only inherent subject of thought we have reason to conclude from analogy that nature uses it after the same manner she does the other substance matter she employs it as a kind of paste or clay modifies it into a variety of forms and existences dissolves after a time each modification and from its substance erects a new form as the same material substance may successively compose the body of all animals the same spiritual substance may compose their minds their consciousness or that system of thought which they formed during life may be continually dissolved by death and nothing interest them in the new modification the most positive asserters of the mortality of the soul never denied the immortality of its substance and that an immaterial substance as well as a material may lose its memory or consciousness appears in part from experience if the soul be immaterial reasoning from the common course of nature and without supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause which ought always to be excluded from philosophy what is incorruptible must also be ingenerable the soul therefore if immortal existed before our birth and if the former state of existence no wise concerned us neither will the latter animals undoubtedly feel think love hate will and even reason tho in a more imperfect manner than man are their souls also immaterial and immortal let us now consider the moral arguments chiefly those arguments derived from the justice of god which is supposed to be farther interested in the farther punishment of the vicious and reward of the virtuous but these arguments are grounded on the supposition that god has attributes beyond what he has exerted in this universe with which alone we are acquainted whence do we infer the existence of these attributes it is very safe for us to affirm that whatever we know the deity to have actually done is best but it is very dangerous to affirm that he must always do what to us seems best in how many instances would this reasoning fail us with regard to the present world but if any purpose of nature be clear we may affirm that the whole scope and intention of mans creation so far as we can judge by natural reason is limited to the present life with how weak a concern from the original inherent structure of the mind and passions does he ever look farther what comparison either for steddiness or efficacy between so floating an idea and the most doubtful persuasion of any matter of fact that occurs in common life there arise indeed in some minds some unaccountable terrors with regard to futurity but these would quickly vanish were they not artificially fostered by precept and education and those who foster them what is their motive only to gain a livelihood and to acquire power and riches in this world their very zeal and industry therefore are an argument against them what cruelty what iniquity what injustice in nature to confine thus all our concern as well as all our knowledge to the present life if there be another scene still awaiting us of infinitely greater consequence ought this barbarous deceit to be ascribed to a beneficent and wise being observe with what exact proportion the task to be performed and the performing powers are adjusted throughout all nature if the reason of man gives him a great superiority above other animals his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him his whole time his whole capacity activity courage passion find sufficient employment in fencing against the miseries of his present condition and frequently nay almost always are too slender for the business assigned them a pair of shoes perhaps was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection which that commodity is capable of attaining yet is it necessary at least very useful that there should be some politicians and moralists even some geometers historians poets and philosophers among mankind the powers of men are no more superior to their wants considered merely in this life than those of foxes and hares are compared to their wants and to their period of existence the inference from parity of reason is therefore obvious on the theory of the souls mortality the inferiority of womens capacity is easily accounted for their domestic life requires no higher faculties either of mind or body this circumstance vanishes and becomes absolutely insignificant on the religious theory the one sex has an equal task to perform with the other their powers of reason and resolution ought also to have been equal and both of them infinitely greater than at present as every effect implies a cause and that another till we reach the first cause of all which is the deity every thing that happens is ordained by him and nothing can be the object of his punishment or vengeance by what rule are punishments and rewards distributed what is the divine standard of merit and demerit shall we suppose that human sentiments have place in the deity however bold that hypothesis we have no conception of any other sentiments according to human sentiments sense courage good manners industry prudence genius c are essential parts of personal merit shall we therefore erect an elysium for poets and heroes like that of the antient mythology why confine all rewards to one species of virtue punishment without any proper end or purpose is inconsistent with our ideas of goodness and justice and no end can be served by it after the whole scene is closed punishment according to our conceptions should bear some proportion to the offence why then eternal punishment for the temporary offences of so frail a creature as man can any one approve of alexanders rage who intended to exterminate a whole nation because they had seized his favourite horse bucephalus heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men the good and the bad but the greatest part of mankind float between vice and virtue were one to go round the world with an intention of giving a good supper to the righteous and a sound drubbing to the wicked he would frequently be embarrassed in his choice and would find that the merits and demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to the value of either to suppose measures of approbation and blame different from the human confounds every thing whence do we learn that there is such a thing as moral distinctions but from our own sentiments what man who has not met with personal provocation or what good naturd man who has could inflict on crimes from the sense of blame alone even the common legal frivolous punishments and does any thing steel the breast of judges and juries against the sentiments of humanity but reflections on necessity and public interest by the roman law those who had been guilty of parricide and confessed their crime were put into a sack along with an ape a dog and a serpent and thrown into the river death alone was the punishment of those who denied their guilt however fully proved a criminal was tryed before augustus and condemned after full conviction but the humane emperor when he put the last interrogatory gave it such a turn as to lead the wretch into a denial of his guilt you surely said the prince did not kill your father this lenity suits our natural ideas of right even towards the greatest of all criminals and even tho it prevents so inconsiderable a sufferance nay even the most bigotted priest would naturally without reflection approve of it provided the crime was not heresy or infidelity for as these crimes hurt himself in his temporal interests and advantages perhaps he may not be altogether so indulgent to them the chief source of moral ideas is the reflection on the interests of human society ought these interests so short so frivolous to be guarded by punishments eternal and infinite the damnation of one man is an infinitely greater evil in the universe than the subversion of a thousand million of kingdoms nature has rendered human infancy peculiarly frail and mortal as it were on purpose to refute the notion of a probationary state the half of mankind dye before they are rational creatures the physical arguments from the analogy of nature are strong for the mortality of the soul and these are really the only philosophical arguments which ought to be admitted with regard to this question or indeed any question of fact where any two objects are so closely connected that all alterations which we have ever seen in the one are attended with proportionable alterations in the other we ought to conclude by all rules of analogy that when there are still greater alterations produced in the former and it is totally dissolved there follows a total dissolution of the latter sleep a very small effect on the body is attended with a temporary extinction at least a great confusion in the soul the weakness of the body and that of the mind in infancy are exactly proportioned their vigor in manhood their sympathetic disorder in sickness their common gradual decay in old age the step farther seems unavoidable their common dissolution in death the last symptoms which the mind discovers are disorder weakness insensibility stupidity the forerunners of its annihilation the farther progress of the same causes encreasing the same effects totally extinguish it judging by the usual analogy of nature no form can continue when transferred to a condition of life very different from the original one in which it was placed trees perish in the water fishes in the air animals in the earth even so small a difference as that of climate is often fatal what reason then to imagine that an immense alteration such as is made on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of thought and sensation can be effected without the dissolution of the whole every thing is in common between soul and body the organs of the one are all of them the organs of the other the existence therefore of the one must be dependent on that of the other the souls of animals are allowed to be mortal and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men that the analogy from one to the other forms a very strong argument their bodies are not more resembling yet no one rejects the arguments drawn from comparative anatomy the metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this kind that philosophy can so much as hearken to nothing in this world is perpetual every being however seemingly firm is in continual flux and change the world itself gives symptoms of frailty and dissolution how contrary to analogy therefore to imagine that one single form seemingly the frailest of any and from the slightest causes subject to the greatest disorders is immortal and indissoluble what a daring theory is that how lightly not to say how rashly entertained how to dispose of the infinite number of posthumous existences ought also to embarrass the religious theory every planet in every solar system we are at liberty to imagine peopled with intelligent mortal beings at least we can fix on no other supposition for these then a new universe must every generation be created beyond the bounds of the present universe or one must have been created at first so prodigiously wide as to admit of this continual influx of beings ought such bold suppositions to be received by any philosophy and that merely on pretence of a bare possibility when it is asked whether agamemnon thersites hannibal nero and every stupid clown that ever existed in italy scythia bactria or guinea are now alive can any man think that a scrutiny of nature will furnish arguments strong enough to answer so strange a question in the affirmative the want of arguments without revelation sufficiently establishes the negative quanto facilius says plinycertiusque sibi quemque credere ac specimen securitatis antigenitali sumere experimento our insensibility before the composition of the body seems to natural reason a proof of a like state after its dissolution were our horror of annihilation an original passion not the effect of our general love of happiness it would rather prove the mortality of the soul for as nature does nothing in vain she would never give us a horror against an impossible event she may give us a horror against an unavoidable event provided our endeavours as in the present case may often remove it to some distance death is in the end unavoidable yet the human species could not be preserved had not nature inspired us with an aversion towards it all doctrines are to be suspected which are favoured by our passions and the hopes and fears which give rise to this doctrine are very obvious it is an infinite advantage in every controversy to defend the negative if the question be out of the common experienced course of nature this circumstance is almost if not altogether decisive by what arguments or analogies can we prove any state of existence which no one ever saw and which no wise resembles any that ever was seen who will repose such trust in any pretended philosophy as to admit upon its testimony the reality of so marvellous a scene some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose and some new faculties of the mind which may enable us to comprehend that logic nothing could set in a fuller light the infinite obligations which mankind have to divine revelation since we find that no other medium could ascertain this great and important

writings as well as to what other interpreters have said about his abilities this view was a rather common one at the turn of the century it helped gain for humes treatise the attention that it deserves but at the same time it discouraged the study of humes other writings particularly the essays as proper sources for his philosophy a few years ago roland hall observed humes essays moral

several subjects did not contain the autobiography but it was added to the first posthumous edition of the history of england in writing his autobiography hume anticipated the keen desire on the publics part to know in view of his scepticism about the claims of revealed religion if he would face death with philosophical tranquillity it was in the context of the lively public debate following humes death that adam smith composed his letter to william strahan describing humes tranquil state of mind during his final months and testifying to his strength of character with the publication of his letter to strahan smith himself now became the target of widespread indignation for his approval of humes manner of death a decade later he would write a single and as thought a very harmless

published in published in a published in a in the treatise of human nature hume divides the perceptions of the mind into impressions and ideas impressions are divided into sensations and passions hume speaks of passions as secondary impressions inasmuch as they usually arise from some preceding sensation or idea he divides the passions into the calm and the violent on occasion the term passion is used narrowly as in the present essay to designate only the more violent passions such as love and hatred grief and joy or pride and humility when hume speaks here of a delicacy of passion he means a disposition to be affected strongly by the violent passions in the face of prosperity or misfortune favors or injuries honors or slights and other accidents of life that lie beyond our control what he here calls tastethe sense of beauty and deformity in actions or objectsis also a passion broadly speaking but normally a calm one a delicacy of taste is a keen sensitivity to beauty and deformity in actions books works of art companions and such this quality of mind is discussed at considerable length by hume in essay of the standard of taste hume sometimes uses the term sentiment broadly to mean passion or feeling as such but at other times as in this passage he uses it synonymously with taste to refer to a special feeling of approbation or disapprobation that arises from the contemplation of objects characters or actions taste or sentiment in this latter sense underlies judgments of beauty and moral worth in the enquiry concerning human understanding hume argues that morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the understanding as of taste and sentiment beauty whether moral or natural is felt more properly than perceived sec xii pt an original connection is one in human nature itself hume is alluding here to the fact that taste is itself a passion and has more in common with the other passions than this essay might suggest the connection of the various passions is discussed by hume in book of the treatise of the passions and in a later recasting of book entitled a dissertation on the passions ovid bcad epistulae ex ponto letters from pontus a faithful study of the

popularizer of modern science whose conversations on the plurality of worlds was published in the judgment is referred to by hume in the treatise as that operation of mind by which we make inferences from sense impressions as in judgments of cause and effect feelings of moral sentiment are also treated on occasion but not consistently as judgments hume nowhere discusses thematically the important question of how the various forms of government should be classified but he touches on the question in many places this essay suggests that governments are to be classified as republics monarchies or as in the case of great britain a mixture of republican and monarchical elements aristocracy and pure democracy would in this classification be types of republican government as would the representative system that hume describes in idea of a perfect commonwealth the distinction in the present essay between liberty and despotism or slavery is not equivalent or even parallel to that between republics and monarchies hume maintains that freedom can prevail in monarchical government just as despotism can prevail in republics tacitus ad the histories the quotation comes at the end of

derived its name from the altar of mars that stood there it was a site for public meetings worship and commerce as hume uses the term in the treatise a priori reasoning compares ideas in abstraction from experienced relationships whereas some of his predecessors such as hobbes had attempted to base moral or political philosophy on a priori reasoning hume sets out to establish moral science on the experimental method of reasoning which was introduced by francis bacon and utilized by isaac newton nevertheless hume sometimes claims in the essays that political principles can be derived a priori ie by general reasoning on our ideas or concepts of the things in question and without reference to particular examples see cicero bc in verrem actio prima first part of the speech against gaius

majority in the house of commons walpole is usually considered to be englands first prime minister although this term was applied to walpole by his enemies in the edition of humes essays there appeared an essay entitled a character of sir robert walpole in editions appearing between and it was printed as a footnote at the end of the present essay that politics may be reduced to a science

and familiarizes them to the mind and their influence on tempers which are thoughtful gentle and moderate may be considerable but what is their influence you will say if the temper be antecedently disposed after the same manner as that to which they pretend to form it they may at least fortify that temper and furnish it with views by which it may entertain and nourish itself here are a few examples of such philosophical reflections is it not certain that every condition has concealed ills then why envy any body every one has known ills and there is a compensation throughout why not be contented with the present custom deadens the sense both of the good and the ill and levels every thing health and humour all the rest of little consequence except these be affected how many other good things have then why be vexed for one ill how many are happy in the condition of which complain how many envy me every good must be paid for fortune by labour favour by flattery would keep the price yet have the commodity expect not too great happiness in life human nature admits it not propose not a happiness too complicated but does that depend on me yes the first choice does life is like a game one may choose the game and passion by degrees seizes the proper object anticipate by your hopes and fancy future consolation which time infallibly brings to every affliction desire to be rich why that may possess many fine objects houses gardens equipage c how many fine objects does nature offer to every one without expence if enjoyed sufficient if not see the effect of custom or of temper which would soon take off the relish of the riches desire fame let this occur if act well shall have the esteem of all my acquaintance and what is all the rest to me these reflections are so obvious that it is a wonder they occur not to every man so convincing that it is a wonder they persuade not every man but perhaps they do occur to and persuade most men when they consider human life by a general and calm survey but where any real affecting incident happens when passion is awakened fancy agitated example draws and counsel urges the philosopher is lost in the man and he seeks in vain for that persuasion which before seemed so firm and unshaken what remedy for this inconvenience assist yourself by a frequent perusal of the entertaining moralists have recourse to the learning of plutarch the imagination of lucian the eloquence of cicero the wit of seneca the gaiety of montaigne the sublimity of shaftesbury moral precepts so couched strike deep and fortify the mind against the illusions of passion but trust not altogether to external aid by habit and study acquire that philosophical temper which both gives force to reflection and by rendering a great part of your happiness independent takes off the edge from all disorderly passions and tranquillizes the mind despise not these helps but confide not too much in them neither unless nature has been favourable in the temper

comic poet whose works were known in humes time only in fragments it is not in the power even of god to make a polite soldier the contrary observation with regard to the manners of soldiers takes place in our days this seems to me a presumption that the ancients owed all their refinement and civility to books and study for which indeed a soldiers life is not so well calculated company and the world is their sphere and if there be any politeness to be learned from company they will certainly have a considerable share of it though all mankind have a strong propensity to religion at certain times and in certain dispositions yet are there few or none who have it to that degree and with that constancy which is requisite to support the character of this profession it must therefore happen that clergymen being drawn from the common mass of mankind as people are to other employments by the views of profit the greater part though no atheists or freethinkers will find it necessary on particular occasions to feign more devotion than they are at that time possessed of and to maintain the appearance of fervor and seriousness even when jaded with the exercises of their religion or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life they must not like the rest of the world give scope to their natural movements and sentiments they must set a guard over their looks and words and actions and in order to support the veneration paid them by the multitude they must not only keep a remarkable reserve but must promote the spirit of superstition by a continued grimace and hypocrisy this dissimulation often destroys the candor and ingenuity of their temper and makes an irreparable breach in their character if by chance any of them be possessed of a temper more susceptible of devotion than usual so that he has but little occasion for hypocrisy to support the character of his profession it is so natural for him to overrate this advantage and to think that it atones for every violation of morality that frequently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite and though few dare openly avow those exploded opinions that every thing is lawful to the saints and that they alone have property in their goods yet may we observe that these principles lurk in every bosom and represent a zeal for religious observances as so great a merit that it may compensate for many vices and enormities this observation is so common that all prudent men are on their guard when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion though at the same time they confess that there are many exceptions to this general rule and that probity and superstition or even probity and fanaticism are not altogether and in every instance incompatible most men are ambitious but the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied by excelling in their particular profession and thereby promoting the interests of society the ambition of the clergy can often be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds and having got what archimedes only wanted namely another world on which he could fix his engines no wonder they move this world at their pleasure most men have an overweaning conceit of themselves but these have a peculiar temptation to that vice who are regarded with such veneration and are even deemed sacred by the ignorant multitude most men are apt to bear a particular regard for members of their own profession but as a lawyer or physician or merchant does each of them follow out his business apart the interests of men of these professions are not so closely united as the interests of clergymen of the same religion where the whole body gains by the veneration paid to their common tenets and by the suppression of antagonists few men can bear contradiction with patience but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this head because all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief which their opinions meet with and they alone pretend to a divine and supernatural authority or have any colour for representing their antagonists as impious and prophane the odium theologicum or theological hatred is noted even to a proverb and means that degree of rancour which is the most furious and implacable revenge is a natural passion to mankind but seems to reign with the greatest force in priests and women because being deprived of the immediate exertion of anger in violence and combat they are apt to fancy themselves despised on that account and their pride supports their vindictive dispositionb thus many of the vices of human nature are by fixed moral causes inflamed in that profession and though several individuals escape the contagion yet all wise governments will be on their guard against the attempts of a society who will for ever combine into one faction and while it acts as a society will for ever be actuated by ambition pride revenge and a persecuting spirit the temper of religion is grave and serious and this is the character required of priests which confines them to strict rules of decency and commonly prevents irregularity and intemperance amongst them the gaiety much less the excesses of pleasure is not permitted in that body and this virtue is perhaps the only one which they owe to their profession in religions indeed founded on speculative principles and where public discourses make a part of religious service it may also be supposed that the clergy will have a considerable share in the learning of the times though it is certain that their taste in eloquence will always be greater than their proficiency in reasoning and philosophy but whoever possesses the other noble virtues of humanity meekness and moderation as very many of them no doubt do is beholden for them to nature or reflection not to the genius of his calling it was no bad expedient in the old romans for preventing the strong effect of

and overran silesia her treasury empty maria theresa made an appeal for aid to the nations that had guaranteed her hereditary succession to the austrian dominions in response to this appeal george of england declared his intention to maintain the balance of power in europe by supplying troops and subsidies to the queen of hungary this policy was strongly supported at first by parliament and the people although it ensured englands involvement in an expensive war on the continent by strengthening maria theresas resolve not to purchase peace by ceding part of silesia to frederick the factious vote to which hume refers came in december when the house of commons approved several war measures including the kings request to take sixteen thousand troops from his electorate of hanover into

retrenching consumption or by increasing wages since people are often more industrious and opulent where there are natural disadvantages of soil and climate to overcome we may expect that artificial burdens such as judicious taxes will likewise be favorable to industry yet hume qualifies the argument by refusing to apply it to taxes on the necessaries of life and by warning that a people can be

that while men are naturally inclined to associate and even to make civil government they tend to prefer the closeness of small associations to the remoteness of large nations thus when the society grows vast and bulky it is natural for men to seek a narrower sphere in which to exercise their powers by forming parties or factions or by cantonizing ie dividing themselves into smaller associations of an institutional or territorial kind shaftesbury continues thus we have wheels within wheels and in some national constitutions notwithstanding the absurdity in politicks we have one empire within another hume takes this as a reference to the german empire with its confederated states a comitia was an assembly of the roman people to vote on business presented to them by the magistrates the comitia curiata was the most ancient of the three types of assembly but in the late republic its work was confined largely to the formal confirmation of magistrates adoptions and wills the comitia centuriata was supposedly instituted by one of the early kings servius tullius in the sixth century bc it was concerned with the enactment of laws the election of the highest magistrates and of the censors the declaration of war and peace and the infliction of the death penalty for political offences the comitia tributa besides enacting legislation on nearly every matter of business elected the tribunes of the plebs and the plebeian aediles and held trials for noncapital offenses in the comitia centuriata the people voted by groups called centuries which were distributed into five main classes according to wealth there were also two additional classes the equites or knights and the plebeians the two wealthiest classes along with the equites had well over a majority of the total number of voting centuries even though the number of citizens in those centuries was far less than the number in the other three classes to say nothing of the number of plebeians thus if the wealthiest citizens were united it was unnecessary for the other classes to vote at all in the comitia tributa the people voted by electoral divisions or tribes with each tribe having one vote irrespective of its number of voters since only four of the thirtyfive tribes represented the city of rome power in the comitia tributa lay decisively in the hands of the country tribes and thus of the agricultural middle class humes description of voting in the comitia centuriata is probably drawn from livy history of rome appian roman history the civil wars decimus brutus had been assigned command of cisalpine gaul in north italy by julius caesar and he refused after caesars death in bc to surrender the province to mark antony one of the controversies between charles and parliament in the period leading up to the civil war involved the kings right without parliamentary approval to impose a levy known as ship money for outfitting the navy john hampden a member of the house of commons and first cousin of oliver cromwell refused to pay twenty shillings assessed on one of his estates under a writ for ship money issued in hampden was tried in the court of the exchequer and in was found guilty by a vote of to by virtue of his trial hampden became a parliamentary leader and a symbol for those who sought to protect liberty and property by limiting the royal prerogative from medieval times the british crown has claimed the power to impress men without their consent for service in the navy naval parties known as press gangs were often used before the nineteenth century to recruit by force a quota of seamen the kings impressment of british subjects in the colonies was one of the grievances that led to the american revolution by speaking here of a state of nature hume seems to be closer to hobbes and locke than to his own position elsewhere in the treatise of human nature hume had insisted that since mans very first state and situation may justly be esteemd social the supposd state of nature must be regarded as a mere philosophical fiction which never had and never coud have any reality in the enquiry concerning the principles of morals he says the following of the state of nature whether such a condition of human nature could ever exist or if it did could continue so long as to merit the appellation of a state may justly be doubted men are necessarily born in a familysociety at least and are trained up by their parents to some rule of conduct and behaviour sec pt hume thus rejects the state of nature conceived as a strictly solitary and asocial condition of man yet the state of nature might be understood as only a condition without civil society or government even hobbes had granted that family society might develop in the state of nature hume could endorse a state of nature thus understood for he emphasizes that large societies may subsist for some time without the establishment of government society without government is one of the most natural states of men and must subsist with the conjunction of many families and long after the first generation treatise be this as it may the passage here seems to be close to the view of hobbes and locke that the state of nature is renewed in civil society whenever an individuals life or liberty is threatened by another even by the civil authority columella says on agriculture lib iii

numbers of mankind in antient and modern times hume rewrote his footnote for some later editions to take notice of wallaces attempted refutation although hume generously acknowledges that wallace has

de uztáriz theorica y practica de comercio y de marina translated as the theory and practice of commerce and maritime affairs chap the principle that hume states herethat a large population is a sign of a happy and virtuous nation and of wise institutionswas widely held in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and it serves to connect the question of population size to important issues in moral and political philosophy for example the debate over the populousness of ancient and modern nations was part of a broader dispute as to the comparative worth of ancient and modern ways of life the alleged depopulation of the world in modern times could be taken as evidence of the defectiveness of modernity the goodness of such things as luxury commerce and republicanism was often judged in terms of the tendency of these things to promote or retard the increase of population and public policies that would promote an increase were in favor this favorable view of large and growing populations was brought into question at the turn of the nineteenth century by the writings of t r malthus which emphasize the tendency of population growth to outrun the supply of food on this

consideration there are always correlative terms invented which answer to both the parts and express their mutual relation if they bear no proportion to each other the term is only invented for the less and marks its distinction from the whole thus man and woman master and servant father and son prince and subject stranger and citizen are correlative terms but the words seaman carpenter smith

afford very strong inferences concerning the manners and customs of different nations the military government of the roman emperors had exalted the soldiery so high that they balanced all the other orders of the state hence miles and paganus became relative terms a thing till then unknown to ancient and still so to modern languages modern superstition exalted the clergy so high that they

year of its foundation measured miles and yards in circumference embracing seven hills it is itself divided into fourteen regions with crossways with their guardian lares if a straight line is drawn from the milestone standing at the head of the roman forum to each of the gates which today number thirtyseven provided that the twelve gates be counted only as one each and the seven of the old gates that exist no longer be omitted the result is a total of miles yards in a straight line but the total length of all the ways through the districts from the same milestone to the extreme edge of the buildings taking in the praetorians camp amounts to a little more than miles if one were further to take into account the height of the buildings a very fair estimate would be formed that would bring us to admit that there has been no city in the whole world that could be compared to rome in magnitude loeb translation by h rackham the loeb latin text reads paces which rackham translates as miles yards hume obviously follows a different manuscript tradition all the best manuscripts of pliny read the passage as here cited and fix the compass of the walls of rome to be thirteen miles the question is what pliny means by paces and how that number was formed the manner in which conceive it is this rome was a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference the forum and consequently the milliarium we know was situated on the banks of the tyber and near the center of the circle or upon the diameter of the semicircular area though there were thirtyseven gates to rome yet only twelve of them had straight streets leading from them to the milliarium pliny therefore having assigned the circumference of rome and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface uses this farther method he supposes all the streets leading from the milliarium to the twelve gates to be laid together into one straight line and supposes we run along that line so as to count each gate once in which case he says that the whole line is paces or in other words that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half and the whole length of rome is five miles and its breadth about half as much besides the scattered suburbs pere hardouin jean hardouin published in an edition of plinys natural history which was reissued in and later with annotations understands this passage in the same manner with regard to the laying together the several streets of rome into one line in order to compose paces but then he supposes that streets led from the milliarium to every gate and that no street exceeded paces in length but a semicircular area whose radius was only paces could never have a circumference near thirteen miles the compass of rome as assigned by pliny a radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference there is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference these streets must interfere as they approach this diminishes too much from the greatness of ancient rome and reduces that city below even bristol or rotterdam the sense which vossius in his observationes variæ see note to this essay puts on this passage of pliny errs widely in the other extreme one manuscript of no authority instead of thirteen miles has assigned thirty miles for the compass of the walls of rome and vossius understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference supposing that as the tyber formed the diameter there were no walls built on that side but this reading is allowed to be contrary to almost all the manuscripts why should pliny a concise writer repeat the compass of the walls of rome in two successive sentences why repeat it with so sensible a variation what is the meaning of plinys mentioning twice the milliarium if a line was measured that had no dependence on the milliarium aurelians wall is said by vopiscus to have been drawn laxiore ambitu in a wider circuit and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north side of the tyber yet its compass was only fifty miles and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text since the walls which remain and which are supposed to be the same with aurelians exceed not twelve miles it is not probable that rome would diminish from augustus to aurelian it remained still the capital of the same empire and none of the civil wars in that long period except the tumults on the death of maximus and balbinus ever affected the city caracalla is said by aurelius victor sextus aurelius victor whose history of the caesars was published around ad to have encreased rome there are no remains of ancient buildings which mark any such greatness of rome vossiuss reply to this objection seems absurd that the rubbish would sink sixty or seventy feet under ground it appears from spartian in vita severi that the fivemile stone

but are summarized by photius and publius victor fix the number of houses in rome to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand the very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic as well as lipsius probably in lipsiuss de magnitudine romana libri quatuor four books on the size of rome if they be necessary destroys the foundation on which they are grounded that rome contained fourteen millions of inhabitants while the whole kingdom of france contains only five according to his computation c the only objection to the sense which we have affixed above to the passage of pliny seems to lie in this that pliny after mentioning the thirtyseven gates of rome assigns only a reason for suppressing the seven old ones and says nothing of the eighteen gates the streets leading from which terminated according to my opinion before they reached the forum but as pliny was writing to the romans who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets it is not strange he should take a circumstance for granted which was so familiar to every body perhaps too many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river ex monument ancyr humes reference is to the emperor augustuss account of his

our demands grow greater our complaints against natures inadequacy are heard by all edwin a quain trans tertullian apologetical works washington catholic university of america press the fathers of the church series vol the air of rhetoric and declamation which appears in this passage diminishes somewhat from its authority but does not entirely destroy itkk the same remark may be extended to the following passage of aristides the sophist who lived in the age of adrian the whole world says he addressing himself to the romans seems to keep one holiday and mankind laying aside the sword which they formerly wore now betake themselves to feasting and to joy the cities forgetting their ancient animosities preserve only one emulation which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament theatres every where arise amphitheatres porticoes aqueducts temples schools academies and one may safely pronounce that the sinking world has been again raised by your auspicious empire nor have cities alone received an encrease of ornament and beauty but the whole earth like a garden or paradise is cultivated and adorned insomuch that such of mankind as are placed out of the limits of your empire who are but few seem to merit our sympathy and compassion probably in aristides oration to rome it is remarkable that though diodorus siculus makes the inhabitants of ægypt when conquered by the romans amount only to three millions library of history almost all ancient manuscripts support humes reading of three million but the loeb edition adopts an alternative reading that makes diodorus agree with josephus yet joseph de bello jud lib ii cap in the loeb edition says that its inhabitants excluding those of alexandria were seven millions and a half in the reign of nero and he expressly says that he drew this account from the books of the roman publicans who levied the polltax strabo lib xvii praises the superior police of the romans with regard to the finances of ægypt above that of its former monarchs and no part of administration is more essential to the happiness of a people yet we read in athenæus lib i cap the banquet of the learned d in the loeb edition who flourished

the emperor augustus having numbered the whole roman empire found it contained only men νδρες there is here surely some great mistake either in the author or transcriber but this authority feeble as

silence of the oracles that hume summarizes is given not by plutarch in his own name but by one of the participants in this dialogue and that alternative explanations are advanced by other participants hume addresses this point in note below lib ii cap it may perhaps be imagined that polybius being dependent on rome would naturally extol the roman dominion but in the first place polybius though one sees sometimes instances of his caution discovers no symptoms of flattery secondly this opinion is only delivered in a single stroke by the by while he is intent upon another subject and it is allowed if there be any suspicion of an authors insincerity that these oblique propositions discover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct assertions annal lib i cap lib viii and ix plutarch de his qui sero a numine puniuntur on the delays of the divine vengeance sec de mercede conductis on salaried posts in great houses must confess that that discourse of plutarch concerning the silence of the oracles is in general of so odd a texture and so unlike his other productions that one is at a loss what judgment to form of it it is written in dialogue which is a method of composition that plutarch commonly but little affects the personages he introduces advance very wild absurd and contradictory opinions more like the visionary systems or ravings of plato than the plain sense of plutarch there runs also through the whole an air of superstition and credulity which resembles very little the spirit that appears in other philosophical compositions of that author for it is remarkable that though plutarch be an historian as superstitious as herodotus or livy yet there is scarcely in all antiquity a philosopher less superstitious excepting cicero and lucian must therefore confess that a passage of plutarch cited from this discourse has much less authority with me than if it had been found in most of his other compositions there is only one other discourse of plutarch liable to like objections to wit that concerning those whose punishment is delayed by the deity it is also writ in dialogue contains like superstitious wild visions and seems to have been chiefly composed in rivalship to plato particularly his last book de republica hume has in mind the myth of er at the conclusion of book of platos republic and here cannot but observe that mons fontenelle a writer eminent for candor seems to have departed a little from his usual character when he endeavours to throw a ridicule upon plutarch on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles the absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascribed to plutarch he makes them refute each other and in general he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions which fontenelle would ridicule him for maintaining see histoire des oracles first published in the first english translation was titled the history of oracles and the cheats of the pagan priests london lib ii the loeb edition reads cavalry he was cotemporary with cæsar and augustus having previously sketched the differences between the whigs and the tories see of the parties of great britain in part hume takes up their speculative practical and historical controversies in this essay and the two that follow hume suggests that it is a contradiction in terms to speak of those who have embraced a party as philosophers p since his own approach is philosophical he seeks to avoid taking sides or being a mere partisan the philosophers task as hume understands it is to serve as a mediator between contending parties and to promote compromise or accommodation this is accomplished by a balanced appraisal of party controversies in which each side is led to see that its views are not completely right and that the opposing views are not completely wrong compromise is possible only if neither party triumphs over the other this may help to explain why hume sometimes seems to be more critical of the whigs the stronger party of his day than of the tories humes design and guiding principles are made explicit at the beginning of the third essay of this sequence of the coalition of parties titus flavius vespasianus was roman emperor from ad to cesare borgia through the influence of his father pope alexander conquered and ruled the territory known as the romagna in northern italy in borgias cruel and enterprising methods are described and applauded by machiavelli in the prince chap tulagee angria was the leader in the mideighteenth century of an

most noted partizan of the doctrine that all lawful government is founded on an original contract or consent of the people humes sketch of this doctrine draws loosely from lockes second treatise hume seeks to show that what these reasoners say is contradicted by common opinion and practice in order to make his argument from general opinion effective hume must reject the claim that moral philosophy has a rational or a priori basis and this he does at the conclusion of the essay the transfer of the british crown to william and mary in was approved by parliamentary conventions called by william in england and scotland by the majority of seven hundred hume probably means the total vote of these conventions approving the transfer and fixing the order of succession after the deaths of william and mary lib ii cap henry was king of england from to tacit ann vi cap king of england from to henrys greatest innovation was his break with the pope and his establishment of the king as the only supreme head on earth of the church of england with full power to reform it the lancastrian kings of england were henry henry and henry their rule extended from to the house of lancaster took the red rose as its badge or emblem while its rival for the throne the house of york took the white rose this division of moral duties is explained fully by hume in the treatise of human nature book and in the enquiry concerning the principles of morals hume consistently places justice fidelity to promises and allegiance to government in a different category from those virtues that we perform and approve by an original instinct of nature in the treatise he presents the division as one between natural and artificial virtues but he retreats somewhat from this terminology in the second enquiry see appendix thus in the present essay justice fidelity and allegiance which had been classified as artificial duties in the treatise are called natural duties hume will argue against locke that it is inappropriate to base allegiance or the obligation to obey rulers on a prior obligation to keep promises since both obligations arise from the same foundation this argument draws heavily on book part of the treatise this brief discussion of the ground of allegiance or the duty to obey government should be compared with humes much fuller treatment of this topic in the treatise of the source of allegiance see humes treatise of the objects of allegiance which addresses at much greater length the question to whom is submission due and who are we to regard as our lawful magistrates this topic is discussed at length by hume in the treatise of the rules which determine property see paul de rapinthoyras histoire d angleterre vols the hague this was the standard history of england until the publication of humes it was written for foreigners but was quickly translated into english rapin who was from a huguenot family first came to england in to avoid persecution and returned two years later with the army of william of orange he wrote his history of england while in retirement in germany initially at least hume judged rapins work harshly because of its partiality for the whig side see humes comments on rapin in the variant readings to of the protestant succession note b the controversy to which hume refers involved the succession to the french throne when charles of france died in his wife was expecting a child who would if a son succeed to the throne in the meantime an assembly of barons was called to appoint as regent the next male heir who would become charless successor if his child were a daughter one claimant was edward of england the nephew and nearest male relation of charles who descended from the royal house of france by his mother but this claim was rejected by the barons philip of valois the late kings cousin was elected regent and after a daughter was born to the queen widow was placed on the throne as philip hume discusses this dispute and its consequences in his account of edwards reign in the history of england germanicus bcad was adopted by his uncle tiberius in ad drusus bcad was the son of tiberius herodian lib ii commodus was emperor

there being no one else at hand loeb translation by david magie the young gordian was saluted as emperor by the praetorians in ad following the murder that year of his uncle and the suicide of his grandfather both emperors named gordian and the murders of balbinus and pupienus maximus who had succeeded the gordians as joint emperors it is remarkable that in the remonstrance of the duke of bourbon and the legitimate princes against this destination of louis the xivth the doctrine of the original contract is insisted on even in that absolute government the french nation say they chusing hugh capet and his posterity to rule over them and their posterity where the former line fails there is a tacit right reserved to choose a new royal family and this right is invaded by calling the bastard princes to the throne without the consent of the nation but the comte de boulainvilliers who wrote in defence of the bastard princes ridicules this notion of an original contract especially when applied to hugh capet who mounted the throne says he by the same arts which have ever been employed by all conquerors and usurpers he got his title indeed recognized by the states after he had put himself in possession but is this a choice or contract the comte de boulainvilliers we may observe was a noted republican but being a man of learning and very conversant in history he knew that the people were never almost consulted in these revolutions and new establishments and that time alone bestowed right and authority on what was commonly at first founded on force and violence see etat

principles of obligation that the laws appeal to in the speech that socrates invents for them but socrates does not say in his own name that a promise to obey the laws obligates him to remain in prison both terms mean to make innovations especially political changes passive obedience is the doctrine that it is not lawful under any pretense whatsoever to take arms against the king or those who act under the kings authority this doctrine was held in the seventeenth century by the court party and in the eighteenth by a segment of the tory party hume grants that this doctrine should not be followed when doing so would threaten the public safety but he defends it as a better practical rule under most circumstances than the whig doctrine of resistance this essay should be compared with humes discussion of the same topic in the treatise of the measures of allegiance in the treatise the doctrine of passive obedience is called an absurdity but in this later and more popular treatment of the matter which was written during or shortly after the jacobite rising of hume takes pains to say nothing that would discredit the salutary principle of obedience to law locke uses this motto as the epigraph to his two treatises of government compare also the beginning of chapter of hobbess leviathan the office of the sovereign be it a monarch or an assembly consisteth in the end for which he was trusted with the sovereign power namely the procuration of the safety of the people but by safety here is not meant a bare preservation but also all other contentments of life which every man by lawful industry without danger or hurt to the commonwealth shall acquire to himself this sentence and the one preceding resemble closely what hobbes says in the leviathan about the cause of oppressive rule see chapter end and about the ancient greeks and romans as the source of the doctrine of tyrannicide see chapter the parliamentary debate that hume is recreating took place in the early s some years after the accession of henry the first tudor monarch in hadrian was emperor from ad to some years after octavian received the title augustus bc and brought the roman republic to an end the argument is that it is as absurd to oppose the crowns prerogatives by appealing to pretudor precedent as it would be to use constitutional practices in republican rome as a precedent in hadrians time

late queen of england this concludes humes recreation of constitutional arguments that the popular party and the royalists might have made at the outbreak of the civil war it should be noted that by the time this essay appeared in late or early hume had completed the volumes of the history of england that deal with the tudor and stuart periods in this essay as in the history he calls into question the prevailing whig interpretation of the constitution hume had prepared this essay along with of the original contract and of passive obedience for the edition of his essays moral and political but his friend charles erskine acting under humes authority had suppressed it hume explained in a letter to erskine that his essay examines the question of the advantages and disadvantages of each line of succession as coolly impartially as if were removd a thousand years from the present period but this is what some people think extremely dangerous sufficient not only to ruin me for ever but also throw some reflection on all my friends particularly those with whom am connected at present have wrote to millar to send you the sheets and hereby make you entire master to dispose of this last essay as you think proper greig letters of david hume the question of the succession was particularly sensitive at this time because of the jacobite rising of on behalf of the young pretender prince charles edward stuart in the aftermath of which many scottish jacobites were executed or imprisoned humes essay reopens the question and gives jacobite arguments in favor of the stuart succession an impartial hearing alongside whig arguments in favor of the hanoverian succession his intention is to weigh the alternatives with the temper as well as the understanding of a philosopher hume concludes by making a strong case for acceptance of the present establishment in the house of hanover he perhaps calculates that the best way to reconcile the jacobites and their sympathizers to the established succession is to begin by giving their side its due christiaan huygens dutch mathematician astronomer physicist and inventor was one of his centurys leading men of

in office the lords of the articles was an ancient institution in the scottish parliament consisting of a committee chosen from the three estates the king was able to shape the composition of the group through his influence over the bishops who had a decisive voice in choosing the other members as hume points out in the history of england chapter no motion could be made in parliament without the previous consent of the lords of the articles this gave the king in addition to his negative after bills had passed through parliament another indirectly before their introduction this latter negative in humes view was a prerogative of much greater consequence than the former and the nation properly speaking could not be said to enjoy any regular freedom until the lords of the articles was

pleased to find that after animosities are subsided and calumny has ceased the whole nation almost have returned to the same moderate sentiments with regard to this great man if they are not rather become more favourable to him by a very natural transition from one extreme to another the author would not oppose those humane sentiments towards the dead though he cannot forbear observing that the

walpoles mansion in norfolk the essays of suicide and of the immortality of the soul were sent by hume to his publisher andrew millar probably in late for inclusion in a volume entitled five

publication yet faced with the prospect of ecclesiastical condemnation and perhaps even official prosecution hume decided at the urging of friends that it would be prudent not to go ahead with publication of the essays on suicide and immortality accordingly they were excised by millar and a new essay of the standard of taste was added to the volume which appeared in under the title four dissertations despite humes precautions clerical critics such as dr william warburton knew of the suppressed essays and sometimes alluded to them the essays even appeared in french translation in apparently without hume ever learning of this fact shortly before his death hume added a codicil to his will expressing the desire that william strahan publish his dialogues concerning natural

university press pp it would be easy to prove that suicide is as lawful under the christian dispensation as it was to the heathens there is not a single text of scripture which prohibits it that great and infallible rule of faith and practice which must controul all philosophy and human reasoning has left us in this particular to our natural liberty resignation to providence is indeed recommended in scripture but that implies only submission to ills which are unavoidable not to such as may be remedied by prudence or courage thou shalt not kill is evidently meant to exclude only the killing of others over whose life we have no authority that this precept like most of the scripture precepts must be modified by reason and common sense is plain from the practice of magistrates who punish criminals capitally notwithstanding the letter of this law but were this commandment ever so express against suicide it could now have no authority for all the law of moses is abolished except so far as it is established by the law of nature and we have already endeavoured to prove that suicide is not prohibited by that law in all cases christians and heathens are precisely upon the same footing and if cato and brutus arria and portia acted heroically those who now imitate their example ought to receive the same praises from posterity the power of committing suicide is regarded by pliny as an

appears a very considerable connexion between them for we may observe that women who have more delicate passions than men have also a more delicate taste of the ornaments of life of dress equipage and the ordinary decencies of behavior any excellency in these hits their taste much sooner than ours and when you please their taste you soon engage their affectionseditions a to q the latter omits the

knowneditions a to p dedition q omits the concluding sentence editions a to p have in place of it the following since therefore that liberty is so essential to the support of our mixed government this sufficiently decides the second question whether such a liberty be advantageous or prejudicial there being nothing of greater importance in every state than the preservation of the ancient government especially if it be a free one but would fain go a step farther and assert that this liberty is attended with so few inconveniencies that it may be claimed as the common right of mankind and ought to be indulged them almost in every government except the ecclesiastical to which indeed it would prove fatal we need not dread from this liberty any such ill consequences as followed from the harangues of the popular demagogues of athens and tribunes of rome a man reads a book or pamphlet alone and coolly there is none present from whom he can catch the passion by contagion he is not hurried away by the force and energy of action and should he be wrought up to ever so seditious a humour there is no violent resolution presented to him by which he can immediately vent his passion the liberty of the press therefore however abused can scarce ever excite popular tumults or rebellion and as to those murmurs or secret discontents it may occasion tis better they should get vent in words that they may come to the knowledge of the magistrate before it be too late in order to his providing a remedy against them mankind it is true have always a greater propension to believe what is said to the disadvantage of their governors than the contrary but this inclination is inseparable from them whether they have liberty or not a whisper may fly as quick and be as pernicious as a pamphlet nay it will be more pernicious where men are not accustomed to think freely or distinguish between truth and falshood it has also been found as the experience of mankind increases that the people are no such dangerous monster as they have been represented and that it is in every respect better to guide them like rational creatures than to lead or drive them like brute beasts before the united provinces set the example toleration was deemed incompatible with good government and it was thought impossible that a number of religious sects could live together in harmony and peace and have all of them an equal affection to their common country and to each other england has set a like example of civil liberty and though this liberty seems to occasion some small ferment at present it has not as yet produced any pernicious effects and it is to be hoped that men being every day more accustomed to the free discussion of public affairs will improve in the judgment of them and be with greater difficulty seduced by every idle rumour and popular clamour it is a very comfortable reflection to the lovers of liberty that this peculiar privilege of britain is of a kind that cannot easily be wrested from us but must last as long as our government remains in any degree free and independent it is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once slavery has so frightful an aspect to men accustomed to freedom that it must steal upon them by degrees and must disguise itself in a thousand shapes in order to be received but if the liberty of the press ever be lost it must be lost at once the general laws against sedition and libelling are at present as strong as they possibly can be made nothing can impose a farther restraint but either the clapping an imprimatur upon the press or the giving to the court very large discretionary powers to punish whatever displeases them but these concessions would be such a barefaced violation of liberty that they will probably be the last efforts of a despotic government we may conclude that the liberty of britain is gone for ever when these attempts shall succeed aeditions a to p insert the followingan equal difference of a contrary kind may

beditions a to n add the following paragraphi shall conclude this subject with observing that the present political controversy with regard to instructions is a very frivolous one and can never be brought to any decision as it is managed by both parties the countryparty pretend not that a member is absolutely bound to follow instructions as an ambassador or general is confined by his orders and that his vote is not to be received in the house but so far as it is conformable to them the courtparty again pretend not that the sentiments of the people ought to have no weight with every member much less that he ought to despise the sentiments of those he represents and with whom he is more particularly connected and if their sentiments be of weight why ought they not to express these sentiments the question then is only concerning the degrees of weight which ought to be placd on instructions but such is the nature of language that it is impossible for it to express distinctly these different degrees and if men will carry on a controversy on this head it may well happen that they differ in their language and yet agree in their sentiments or differ in their sentiments and yet agree in their language besides how is it possible to find these degrees considering the variety of affairs which come before the house and the variety of places which members represent ought the instructions of totness to have the same weight as those of london or instructions with regard to the convention which respected foreign politics to have the same weight as those with regard to the excise which respected only our domestic affairs ain editions a to n this essay is introduced by the following examination of the spirit of parties have frequently observed in comparing the conduct of the court and country parties that the former are commonly less assuming and dogmatical in conversation more apt to make concessions and tho not perhaps more susceptible of conviction yet more able to bear contradiction than the latter who are apt to fly out upon any opposition and to regard one as a mercenary designing fellow if he argues with any coolness and impartiality or makes any concessions to their adversaries this is a fact which believe every one may have observed who has been much in companies where political questions have been discussed tho were one to ask the reason of this difference every party would be apt to assign a different reason gentlemen in the opposition will ascribe it to the very nature of their party which being founded on public spirit and a zeal for the constitution cannot easily endure such doctrines as are of pernicious consequence to liberty the courtiers on the other hand will be apt to put us in mind of the clown mentioned by lord shaftsbury a clown says that excellent author once took a fancy to hear the latin disputes of doctors at an university he was asked what pleasure he could take in viewing such combatants when he could never know so much as which of the parties had the better for that matter replied the clown ant such a fool neither but can see whos the first that puts tother into a passion nature herself dictated this lesson to the clown that he who had the better of the argument would be easy and wellhumoured but he who was unable to support his cause by reason would naturally lose his temper and grow violent to which of these reasons shall we adhere to neither of them in my opinion unless we have a mind to enlist ourselves and become zealots in either party believe can assign the reason of this different conduct of the two parties without offending either the country party are plainly most popular at present and perhaps have been so in most administrations so that being accustomed to prevail in company they cannot endure to hear their opinions controverted but are as confident on the public favour as if they were supported in all their sentiments by the most infallible demonstration the courtiers on the other hand are commonly so run down by popular talkers that if you speak to them with any moderation or make them the smallest concessions they think themselves extremely beholden to you and are apt to return the favour by a like moderation and facility on their part to be furious and passionate they know would only gain them the character of shameless mercenaries not that of zealous patriots which is the character that such a warm behaviour is apt to acquire to the other party in all controversies we find without regarding the truth or falshood on either side that those who defend the established and popular opinions are always the most dogmatical and imperious in their stile while their adversaries affect almost extraordinary gentleness and moderation in order to soften as much as possible any prejudices that may lye against them consider the behavior of our freethinkers of all denominations whether they be such as decry all revelation or only oppose the exorbitant power of the clergy collins tindal foster hoadley compare their moderation and good manners with the furious zeal and scurrility of their adversaries and you will be convinced of the truth of my observation a like difference may be observed in the conduct of those french writers who maintained the controversy with regard to ancient and modern learning boileau monsieur and madame dacier labbé de bos who defended the party of the ancients mixed their reasonings with satire and invective while fontenelle la motte charpentier and even perrault never transgressed the bounds of moderation and good breeding though provoked by the most injurious treatment of their adversaries must however observe that this remark with regard to the seeming moderation of the court party is entirely confind to conversation and to gentlemen who have been engagd by interest or inclination in that party for as to the courtwriters being commonly hird scriblers they are altogether as scurrilous as the mercenaries of the other party nor has the gazeteer any advantage in this respect above common sense a man of education will in any party discover himself to be such by his goodbreeding and decency as a scoundrel will always betray the opposite qualities the false accusers accusd c is very scurrillous tho that side of the question being least popular shoud be defended with most moderation when ld be ld mt mr ln take the pen in hand tho they write with warmth they presume not upon their popularity so far as to transgress the bounds of decency this paragraph is found only in editions a and b am led into this train of reflection by considering some papers wrote upon that grand topic of court influence and parliamentary dependence where in my humble opinion the country party besides vehemence and satyre shew too rigid an inflexibility and too great a jealousy of making concessions to their adversaries their reasonings lose their force by being carried too far and the popularity of their opinions has seduced them to neglect in some measure their justness and solidity the following reason will hope serve to justify me in this opinion bin the present depraved state of mankind editions a to cthe reference to

of a real distinction between these parties what every one may have observed or heard concerning the conduct and conversation of all his friends and acquaintance on both sides have not the tories always borne an avowed affection to the family of stuart and have not their adversaries always opposed with vigour the succession of that family the tory principles are confessedly the most favourable to monarchy yet the tories have amost always opposed the court these fifty years nor were they cordial friends to king william even when employed by him their quarrel therefore cannot be supposed to have lain with the throne but with the person who sat on it they concurred heartily with the court during the four last years of queen anne but is any one at a loss to find the reason the succession of the crown in the british government is a point of too great consequence to be absolutely indifferent to persons who concern themselves in any degree about the fortune of the public much less can it be supposed that the tory party who never valued themselves upon moderation could maintain a stoical indifference in a point of such importance were they therefore zealous for the house of hanover or was there any thing that kept an opposite zeal from openly appearing if it did not openly appear but prudence and a sense of decency this paragraph is not in a and b tis monstrous to see an established episcopal clergy in declared opposition to the court and a nonconformist presbyterian clergy in conjunction with it what could have produced such an unnatural conduct in both nothing but that the former espoused monarchical principles too high for the present settlement which is founded on principles of liberty and the latter being afraid of the prevalence of those high principles adhered to that party from whom they had reason to expect liberty and toleration the different conduct of the two parties with regard to foreign politics is also a proof to the same purpose holland has always been most favoured by one and france by the other in short the proofs of this kind seem so palpable and evident that tis almost needless to collect them kso the essay concludes in editions q and r in place of the last paragraph the preceding editions read as follows tis however remarkable that tho the principles of whig and tory were both of them of a compound nature yet the ingredients which predominated in both were not correspondent to each other a tory loved monarchy and bore an affection to the family of stuart but the latter affection was the predominant inclination of the party a whig loved liberty and was a friend to the settlement in the protestant line but the love of liberty was professedly his predominant inclination the tories have frequently acted as republicans where either policy or revenge has engaged them to that conduct and there was no one of that party who upon the supposition that he was to be disappointed in his views with regard to the succession would not have desired to impose the strictest limitations on the crown and to bring our form of government as near republican as possible in order to depress the family which according to his apprehension succeeded without any just title the whigs tis true have also taken steps dangerous to liberty under colour of securing the succession and settlement of the crown according to their views but as the body of the party had no passion for that succession otherwise than as the means of securing liberty they have been betrayed into these steps by ignorance or frailty or the interests of their leaders the succession of the crown was therefore the chief point with the tories the security of our liberties with the whigs the remainder of this paragraph is not in a and b nor is this seeming irregularity at all difficult to be accounted for by our present theory court and country parties are the true parents of tory and whig but tis almost impossible that the attachment of the court party to monarchy should not degenerate into an attachment to the monarch there being so close a connexion between them and the latter being so much the more natural object how easily does the worship of the divinity degenerate into a worship of the idol the connexion is not so great between liberty the divinity of the old country party or whigs and any monarch or royal family nor is it so reasonable to suppose that in that party the worship can be so easily transferred from the one to the other tho even that would be no great miracle tis difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and sentiments of any particular man but tis almost impossible to distinguish those of a whole party where it often happens that no two persons agree precisely in the same maxims of conduct yet will venture to affirm that it was not so much principle or an opinion of indefeasible right which attached the tories to the ancient royal family as affection or a certain love and esteem for their persons the same cause divided england formerly between the houses of york and lancaster and scotland between the families of bruce and baliol in an age when political disputes were but little in fashion and when political principles must of course have had but little influence on mankind the doctrine of passive obedience is so absurd in itself and so opposite to our liberties that it seems to have been chiefly left to pulpitdeclaimers and to their deluded followers among the vulgar men of better sense were guided by affection and as to the leaders of this party tis probable that interest was their chief motive and that they acted more contrary to their private sentiments than the leaders of the opposite party the remainder of this paragraph is not in a and b tho tis almost impossible to maintain with zeal the right of any person or family without acquiring a goodwill to them and changing the principle into affection yet this is less natural to people of an elevated station and liberal education who have had full opportunity of observing the weakness folly and arrogance of monarchs and have found them to be nothing superior if not rather inferior to the rest of mankind the interest therefore of being heads of a party does often with such people supply the place both of principle and affection some who will not venture to assert that the real difference between whig and tory was lost at the revolution seem inclined to think that the difference is now abolished and that affairs are so far returned to their natural state that there are at present no other parties amongst us but court and country that is men who by interest or principle are attached either to monarchy or to liberty it must indeed be confest that the tory party seem of late to have decayed much in their numbers still more in their zeal and may venture to say still more in their credit and authority there are few men of knowledge or learning at least few philosophers since mr locke has wrote who would not be ashamed to be thought of that party and in almost all companies the name of old whig is mentioned as an uncontestable appellation of honour and dignity accordingly the enemies of the ministry as a reproach call the courtiers the true tories and as an honour denominate the gentlemen in the opposition the true whigs the last two sentences were omitted in p a and b read no man omitting at least wrote the tories have been so long obliged to talk in the republican stile that they seem to have made converts of themselves by their hypocrisy and to have embraced the sentiments as well as language of their adversaries there are however very considerable remains of that party in england with all their old prejudices and a proof that court and country are not our only parties is that almost all the dissenters side with the court and the lower clergy at least of the church of england with the opposition this may convince us that some biass still hangs upon our constitution some intrinsic weight which turns it from its natural course and causes a confusion in our parties this sentence does not occur in a shall conclude this subject with observing that we never had any tories in scotland according to the proper signification of the word and that the division of parties in this country was really into whigs and jacobites a jacobite seems to be a tory who has no regard to the constitution but is either a zealous partizan of absolute monarchy or at least willing to sacrifice our liberties to the obtaining the succession in that family to which he is attached the reason of the difference between england and scotland take to be this political and religious divisions in the latter country have been since the revolution regularly correspondent to each other the presbyterians were all whigs without exception those who favoured episcopacy of the opposite party and as the clergy of the latter sect were turned out of the churches at the revolution they had no motive for making any compliances with the government in their oaths or their forms of prayers but openly avowed the highest principles of their party which is the cause why their followers have been more violent than their brethren of the tory party in england as violent things have not commonly so long a duration as moderate we actually find that the jacobite party is almost entirely vanishd from among us and that the distinction of court and country which is but creeping in at london is the only one that is ever mentiond in this kingdom beside the violence and openness of the jacobite party another reason has perhaps contributed to produce so sudden and so visible an alteration in this part of britain there are only two ranks of men among us gentlemen who have some fortune and education and the meanest slaving poor without any considerable number of that middling rank of men which abounds more in england both in cities and in the country than in any other part of the world the slaving poor are incapable of any principles gentlemen may be converted to true principles by time and experience the middling rank of men have curiosity and knowledge enough to form principles but not enough to form true ones or correct any prejudices that they may have imbibd and tis among the middling rank that tory principles do at present prevail most in england this final paragraph appears only in a and b lthis note does not occur in any edition prior to the final sentence of the note is added in q and r ain editions a and b this and the three next paragraphs were written as follows my first reflection is that religions which partake of enthusiasm are on their first rise much more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition but in a little time become much more gentle and moderate the violence of this species of religion when excited by novelty and animated by opposition appears from numberless instances of the anabaptists in germany the camisars in france the levellers and other fanaticks in england and the covenanters in scotland as enthusiasm is founded on strong spirits and a presumptuous boldness of character it naturally begets the most extreme resolutions especially after it rises to that height as to inspire the deluded fanaticks with the opinion of divine illuminations and with a contempt of the common rules of reason morality and prudence tis thus enthusiasm produces the most cruel desolation in human society but its fury is like that of thunder and tempest which exhaust themselves in a little time and leave the air more calm and serene than before the reason of this will appear evidently by comparing enthusiasm to superstition the other species of false religion and tracing the natural consequences of each as superstition is founded on fear sorrow and a depression of spirits it represents the person to himself in such despicable colours that he appears unworthy in his own eyes of approaching the divine presence and naturally has recourse to any other person whose sanctity of life or perhaps impudence and cunning have made him be supposed to be more favoured by the divinity to him they entrust their devotions to his care they recommend their prayers petitions and sacrifices and by his means hope to render their addresses acceptable to their incensed deity hence the origin of priests who may justly be regarded as one of the grossest inventions of a timorous and abject superstition which ever diffident of itself dares not offer up its own devotions but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to the divinity by the mediation of his supposed friends and servants as superstition is a considerable ingredient of almost all religions even the most fanatical there being nothing but philosophy able to conquer entirely these unaccountable terrors hence it proceeds that in almost every sect of religion there are priests to be found but the stronger mixture there is of superstition the higher is the authority of the priesthood modern judaism and popery especially the latter being the most barbarous and absurd superstitions that have yet been known in the world are the most enslavd by their priests as the church of england may justly be said to retain a strong mixture of popish superstition it partakes also in its original constitution of a propensity to priestly power and dominion particularly in the respect it exacts to the priest and though according to the sentiments of that church the prayers of the priest must be accompanied with those of the laity yet is he the mouth of the congregation his person is sacred and without his presence few would think their public devotions or the sacraments and other rites acceptable to the divinity on the other hand it may be observed that all enthusiasts have been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have exprest a great independence in their devotion with a contempt of forms tradition and authorities the quakers are the most egregious tho at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts that have been yet known and are perhaps the only sect that have never admitted priests among them the independents of all the english sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage the presbyterians follow after at an equal distance in both these particulars in short this observation is founded on the most certain experience and will also appear to be founded on reason if we consider that as enthusiasm arises from a presumptuous pride and confidence it thinks itself sufficiently qualified to approach the divinity without any human mediator its rapturous devotions are so fervent that it even imagines itself actually to approach him by the way of contemplation and inward converse which makes it neglect all those outward ceremonies and observances to which the assistance of the priests appears so requisite in the eyes of their superstitious votaries the fanatick consecrates himself and bestows on his own person a sacred character much superior to what forms and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other tis therefore an infallible rule that superstition is favourable to priestly power and euthusiasm as much or rather more contrary to it than sound reason and philosophy the consequences are evident when the first fire of enthusiasm is spent men naturally in such fanatical sects sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matters there being no body of men amongst them endowd with sufficient authority whose interest is concerned to support the religious spirit superstition on the contrary steals in gradually and insensibly renders men tame and submissive is acceptable to the magistrate and seems inoffensive to the people till at last the priest having firmly establishd his authority becomes the tyrant and disturber of human society by his endless contentions persecutions and religious wars how smoothly did the romish church advance in their acquisition of power but into what dismal convulsions did they throw all europe in order to maintain it on the other hand our sectaries who were formerly such dangerous bigots are now become our greatest freethinkers and the quakers are perhaps the only regular body of deists in the universe except the literati or disciples of confucius in china bthe following note is appended in editions to n by priests here mean only the pretenders to power and dominion and to a superior sanctity of character distinct from virtue and good morals these are very different from clergymen who are set apart by the laws to the care of sacred matters and to the conducting our public devotions with greater decency and order there is no rank of men more to be respected than the latter cas one of the grossest inventions to n dhere to p add modern judaism and popery especially the latter being the most unphilosophical and absurd superstitions which have yet been known in the world are the most enslaved by their priests as the church of england may justly be said to retain some mixture of popish supersitition it partakes also in its original constitution of a propensity to priestly power and dominion particularly in the respect it exacts to the sacerdotal character and though according to the sentiments of that church the prayers of the priest must be accompanied with those of the laity yet is he the mouth of the congregation his person is sacred and without his presence few would think their public devotions or the sacraments and other rites acceptable to the

bolingbrokec and fplatos and virgilsc and plutarchs and virgilsk to p gc to p proceed have confest that there is something accidental in the origin and progress of the arts in any nation and yet cannot forbear thinking that if the other learned and polite nations of europe had possest the same advantages of a popular government they would probably have carried eloquence to a greater height than it has yet reached in britain the french sermons especially those of flechier and bossuet are much superior to the english in this particular and in both these authors are found many strokes of the most sublime poetry and and in flechier there are found many strokes of the most sublime poetry his funeral sermon on the marechal de turenne is a good instance none but private causes in that country are ever debated before their parliaments or courts of judicature but notwithstanding this disadvantage there appears a spirit of eloquence in many of their lawyers which with proper cultivation and encouragement might rise to the greatest height the pleadings of patru are very elegant and give us room to imagine what so fine a genius could have performed in questions concerning public liberty or slavery peace or war who exerts himself with such success in debates concerning the price of an old horse or a gossiping story of a quarrel between an abbess and her nuns for tis remarkable that this polite writer tho esteemed by all the men of wit in his time was never employed in the most considerable causes of their courts of judicature but lived and died in poverty from an ancient prejudice industriously propagated by the dunces in all countries that a man of genius is unfit for business the disorders produced by the factions against cardinal mazarine made the parliament of paris enter into the discussion of public affairs and during that short interval there appeared many symptoms of the revival of ancient eloquence the avocat generaltalon in an oration invoked on his knees the spirit of st louis to look down with compassion on his divided and unhappy people and to inspire them from above with the love of concord and unanimity the members of the french academy have attempted to give us models of eloquence in their harangues at their admittance but having no subject to discourse upon they have run altogether into a fulsome strain of panegyric and flattery the most barren of all subjects their stile however is commonly on these occasions very elevated and sublime and might reach the greatest heights were it employed on a subject more favourable and engaging there are some circumstances confess in the english temper and genius which are disadvantageous to the progress of eloquence and render all attempts of that kind more dangerous and difficult among them than among any other nation the english are conspicuous for goodsense which makes them very jealous of any attempts to deceive them by the flowers of rhetoric and elocution they are also peculiarly modest which makes them consider it as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing but reason to public assemblies or attempt to guide them by passion or fancy may perhaps be allowed to add that the people in general are not remarkable for delicacy of taste or for sensibility to the charms of the muses their musical parts to use the expression of a noble author are but indifferent hence their comic poets to move them must have recourse to obscenity their tragic poets to blood and slaughter and hence their orators being deprived of any such resource have abandoned altogether the hopes of moving them and have confined themselves to plain argument and reasoning these circumstances joined to particular accidents may perhaps have retarded the growth of eloquence in this kingdom but will not be able to prevent its success if ever it appear amongst us and one may safely pronounce that this is a field in which the most flourishing laurels may yet be gathered if any youth of accomplished genius thoroughly acquainted with all the polite arts and not ignorant of public business should appear in parliament and accustom our ears to an eloquence more commanding and pathetic and to confirm me in this opinion there occur two considerations the one derived from ancient the other from modern times hthe clause with precision added in edition k aeditions to p add

said something decisive on the subject and have carried every thing before him as he always does on other occasions there is also a spirit of dialogue observed in the eloquent books de oratore and a tolerable equality maintained among the speakers but then these speakers are the great men of the age preceding the author and he recounts the conference as only from hearsay ithis paragraph is not

that mixt companies without the fairsex are the most insipid entertainment in the world and destitute of gaiety and politeness as much as of sense and reason nothing can keep them from excessive dulness but hard drinking a remedy worse than the disease oeditions to p insert the following the point of honour or duelling is a modern invention as well as gallantry and by some esteemed equally useful for the refining of manners but how it has contributed to that effect am at a loss to determine conversation among the greatest rustics is not commonly invested with such rudeness as can give occasion to duels even according to the most refined laws of this fantastic honour and as to the other small indecencies which are the most offensive because the most frequent they can never be cured by the practice of duelling but these notions are not only useless they are also pernicious by separating the man of honour from the man of virtue the greatest profligates have got something to value themselves upon and have been able to keep themselves in countenance tho guilty of the most shameful and most dangerous vices they are debauchees spendthrifts and never pay a farthing they owe but they are men of honour and therefore are to be received as gentlemen in all companies there are some of the parts of modern honour which are the most essential parts of morality such as fidelity the

real history affords more just reflection and improvement is not machiavels comment on livy a work surely of great judgment and genius founded entirely on this period which is represented as fabulous woud willingly therefore in my private sentiments divide the matter with these critics and allow that the battles and victories and triumphs of those ages had been extremely falsifyd by family memoirs as cicero says they were but as in the accounts of domestic factions there were two opposite relations transmitted to posterity this both servd as a check upon fiction and enabled latter historians to gather some truth from comparison and reasoning half of the slaughter which livy commits on the æqui and the volsci would depopulate france and germany and that historian tho perhaps he may be justly charged as superficial is at last shockd himself with the incredibility of his narration the same love of exaggeration seems to have magnifyd the numbers of the romans in their armies and census beditions h to p proceed as follows europe has now for above a century remained on the defensive against the greatest force that ever perhaps was formed by the civil or political combination of mankind and such is the influence of the maxim here treated of that tho that ambitious nation in the five last general wars have been victorious in four and unsuccessful only in one they have not much enlarged their dominions nor acquired a total ascendant over europe there remains rather room to hope that by maintaining the resistance for some time the natural revolutions of human affairs together with unforeseen events and accidents may guard us against universal monarchy and preserve the world from so great an evil in the three last of these general wars britain has stood foremost in the glorious struggle and she still maintains her station as guardian of the general liberties of europe and patron of mankind ceditions h to o such as europe is at present threatened with aeditions h to p read among those whom in this country we call ways and means men and who are denominated financiers and maltotiers in france beditions h to p insert as follows tis always observed in years of scarcity if it be not extreme that the poor labour more and really live better than in years of great plenty when they indulge themselves in idleness and riot have been told by a considerable manufacturer that in the year when bread and provisions of all kinds were very dear his workmen not only made a shift to live but paid debts which they had contracted in former years that were much more favourable and abundant this doctrine therefore with regard to taxes may be admitted in some degree but beware of the abuse exorbitant taxes like extreme necessity destroy industry by producing despair and even before they reach this pitch they raise the wages of the labourer and manufacturer and heighten the price of all commodities an attentive disinterested legislature will observe the point when the emolument ceases and the prejudice begins but as the contrary character is much more common tis to be feared that taxes all over europe are multiplying to such a degree as will intirely crush all art and industry tho perhaps their first increase together with other circumstances might have contributed to the growth of these advantages cthis clause was first added in edition q deditions h to p omit the opening sentences as far as foreign markets and read instead of them there is a prevailing opinion that all taxes however levied fall upon the land at last such an opinion may be useful in britain by checking the landed gentlemen in whose hands our legislature is chiefly lodged and making them preserve great regard for trade and industry but must confess that this principle tho first advanced by a celebrated writer has so little appearance of reason that were it not for his authority it had never been received by any body ethe concluding sentence is not in editions h to oed p reads in its place no labour in any commodities that are exported can be very considerably raised in the price without losing the foreign market and as some part of almost every manufactory is exported this circumstance keeps the price of most species of labour nearly the same after the imposition of taxes may add that it has this effect upon the whole for were any kind of labour paid beyond its proportion all hands would flock to it and would soon sink it to a level with the rest aeditions h to p add beyond the evidence of a hundred demonstrations bthis paragraph was added in ed q ceditions h to p add and these puzzling arguments for they deserve not the name of specious though they could not be the foundation of lord orfords conduct for he had more sense served at least to keep his partizans in countenance and perplex the understanding of the nation deditions h to p add there is a word which is here in the mouth of every body and which find has also got abroad and is much employed by foreign writers in imitation of the english and this is circulation this word serves as an account of every thing and though confess that have sought for its meaning in the present subject ever since was a schoolboy have never yet been able to discover it what possible advantage is there which the nation can reap by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand or is there any parallel to be drawn from the circulation of other commodities to that of chequernotes and india bonds where a manufacturer has a quick sale of his goods to the merchant the merchant to the shopkeeper the shopkeeper to his customers this enlivens industry and gives new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen and makes them produce more and better commodities of the same species a stagnation is here pernicious wherever it happens because it operates backwards and stops or benumbs the industrious hand in its production of what is useful to human life but what production we owe to changealley or even what consumption except that of coffee and pen ink and paper have not yet learned nor can one forsee the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity though that place and all its inhabitants were for ever buried in the ocean but though this term has never been explained by those who insist so much on the advantages that result from a circulation there seems however to be some benefit of a similiar kind arising from our incumbrances as indeed what human evil is there which is not attended with some advantage this we shall endeavour to explain that we may estimate the weight which we ought to allow it eeditions h to o add as a note on this head shall observe without interrupting the thread of the argument that the multiplicity of our public debts serves rather to sink the interest and that the more the government borrows the cheaper may they expect to borrow contrary to first appearance and contrary to common opinion the profits of trade have an influence on interest see essay fthe remainder of this paragraph was added in ed q gedition p adds we may also remark that this increase of prices derived from papercredit has a more durable and a more dangerous influence than when it arises from a great increase of gold and silver where an accidental overflow of money raises the price of labor and commodities the evil remedies itself in a little time the money soon flows out into all the neighbouring nations the prices fall to a level and industry may be continued as before a relief which cannot be expected where the circulating specie consists chiefly of paper and has no intrinsic value heditions h to n read are a check upon industry heighten the price of labour and are an oppr c ithe six following paragraphs were added in ed o jeditions h to p add the note in times of peace and security when alone it is possible to pay debt the monied interest are averse to receive partial payments which they know not how to dispose of to advantage and the landed interest are averse to continue the taxes requisite for that purpose why therefore should a minister persevere in a measure so disagreeable to all parties for the sake suppose of a posterity which he will never see or of a few reasonable reflecting people whose united interest perhaps will not be able to secure him the smallest burrough in england tis not likely we shall ever find any minister so bad a politician with regard to these narrow destructive maxims of politics all ministers are expert enough keditions h to p add some neighbouring states practise an easy expedient by which they lighten their public debts the french have a custom as the romans formerly had of augmenting their money and this the nation has been so much familiarised to that it hurts not public credit though it be really cutting off at once by an edict so much of their debts the dutch diminish the interest without the consent of their creditors or which is the same thing they arbitrarily tax the funds as well as other property could we practise either of these methods we need never be oppressed by the national debt and it is not impossible but one of these or some other method may at all adventures be tried on the augmentation of our incumbrances and difficulties but people in this country are so good reasoners upon whatever regards their interests that such a practice will deceive nobody and public credit will probably tumble at once by so dangerous a trial lthis paragraph appears in editions h to p as a footnote meditions h to p or rather enemy for we have but one to dread aeditions h to p among the people the most humane and the best natured athe following footnote appears in editions h and an eminent clergyman in edinburgh having wrote some years ago a discourse on the same question with this of the populousness of antient nations was pleasd lately to communicate it to the author it maintaind the opposite side of the argument to what is here insisted on and contained much erudition and good reasoning the author acknowledges to have borrowd with some variations from that discourse two computations that with regard to the number of inhabitants in belgium and that with regard to those in epirus if this learned gentleman be prevaild on to publish his dissertation it will serve to give great light into the present question the most curious and important of all questions of erudition in editions k to p the following note is substituted for the preceding an ingenious writer has honoured this discourse with an answer full of politeness erudition and good sense so learned a refutation would have made the author suspect that his reasonings were entirely overthrown had he not used the precaution from the beginning to keep himself on the sceptical side and having taken this advantage of the ground he was enabled tho with much inferior forces to preserve himself from a total defeat that reverend gentleman will always find where his antagonist is so entrenched that it will be difficult to force him varro in such a situation could defend himself against hannibal pharnaces against cæsar the author however very willingly acknowledges that his antagonist has detected many mistakes both in his authorities and reasonings and it was owing entirely to that gentlemans

suspected of temerity when it pretends to correct or dispute the plain testimony of ancient historians by any probable or analogical reasonings yet the licence of authors upon all subjects particularly with regard to numbers is so great that we ought still to retain a kind of doubt or reserve whenever the facts advanced depart in the least from the common bounds of nature and experience shall give an instance with regard to modern history sir william temple tells us in his memoirs that having a free conversation with charles the he took the opportunity of representing to that monarch the impossibility of introducing into this island the religion and government of france chiefly on account of the great force requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people the romans says he were forced to keep up twelve legions for that purpose a great absurdity and cromwell left an army of near eighty thousand men must not this last be regarded as unquestioned by future critics when they find it asserted by a wise and learned minister of state cotemporary to the fact and who addressed his discourse upon an ungrateful subject to a great monarch who was also cotemporary and who himself broke those very forces about fourteen years before yet by the most undoubted authority we may insist that cromwells army when he died did not amount to half the number here mentioned xin

either my memory or reading and that writer tho otherwise very ingenious has given into a bad practice of delivering a great deal of erudition without one citation but supposing that that enumeration coud be justifyd by good authority from antiquity we may establish the following computation the free greeks of all ages and sexes were the slaves computing them by the number of athenian slaves as above who seldom marryd or had families were double the male citizens of full age viz and the whole inhabitants of antient greece about one million three hundred and eighty thousand no mighty number

bfor this sentence and the next editions h to p read as follows k to p in a note it appears from the speeches and proclamations and whole train of king james is actions as well as his sons that they considered the english government as a simple monarchy and never imagined that any considerable part of their subjects entertained a contrary idea this made them discover their pretensions without preparing any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which are always employed by those who enter upon any new project or endeavour to innovate in any government king james told his parliament plainly when they meddled in state affairs ne sutor ultra crepidam he used also at his table in promiscuous companies to advance his notions in a manner still more undisguised as we may learn from a story told in the life of mr waller and which that poet used frequently to repeat when mr waller was young he had the curiosity to go to court and he stood in the circle and saw king james dine where amongst other company there sat at table two bishops the king openly and aloud proposed this question whether he might not take his subjects money when he had occasion for it without all this formality of parliament the one bishop readily replied god forbid you should not for you are the breath of our nostrils the other bishop declined answering and said he was not skilled in parliamentary cases but upon the kings urging him and saying he would admit of no evasion his lordship replied very pleasantly why then think your majesty may lawfully take my brothers money for he offers it in sir walter raleighs preface to the history of the world there is this remarkable passage philip by strong hand and main force attempted to make himself not only an absolute monarch over the netherlands like unto the kings and sovereigns of england and france but turklike to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws privileges and antient rightsspenser speaking of some grants of the english kings to the irish corporations says all which tho at the time of their first grant they were tolerable and perhaps reasonable yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient

parliamentary title preferably to an hereditary one tho they are great are too refined ever to enter into the conception of the vulgar the bulk of mankind would never allow them to be sufficient for committing what would be regarded as an injustice to the prince they must be supported by some gross popular and familar topics and wise men though convinced of their force would reject them in compliance with the weakness and prejudices of the people an incroaching tyrant or deluded bigot alone by his misconduct is able to enrage the nation and render practicable what was always perhaps desirable geditions h to p insert the following paragraph in the last war it has been of service to us by furnishing us with a considerable body of auxiliary troops the bravest and most faithful in the world the elector of hanover is the only considerable prince in the empire who has pursued no separate end and has raised up no stale pretensions during the late commotions of europe but has acted all along with the dignity of a king of britain and ever since the accession of that family it would be difficult to show any harm we have ever received from the electoral dominions except that short

questions have been discussed tho were one to ask the reason of this difference every party would be apt to assign a different reason gentlemen in the opposition will ascribe it to the very nature of their party which being founded on public spirit and a zeal for the constitution cannot easily endure such doctrines as are of pernicious consequence to liberty the courtiers on the other hand will be apt to put us in mind of the clown mentioned by lord shaftsbury a clown says that excellent author once took a fancy to hear the latin disputes of doctors at an university he was asked what pleasure he could take in viewing such combatants when he could never know so much as which of the parties had the better for that matter replied the clown ant such a fool neither but can see whos the first that puts tother into a passion nature herself dictated this lesson to the clown that he who had the better of the argument would be easy and wellhumoured but he who was unable to support his cause by reason would naturally lose his temper and grow violent to which of these reasons shall we adhere to neither of them in my opinion unless we have a mind to enlist ourselves and become zealots in either party believe can assign the reason of this different conduct of the two parties without offending either the country party are plainly most popular at present and perhaps have been so in most administrations so that being accustomed to prevail in company they cannot endure to hear their opinions controverted but are as confident on the public favour as if they were supported in all their sentiments by the most infallible demonstration the courtiers on the other hand are commonly so run down by popular talkers that if you speak to them with any moderation or make them the smallest concessions they think themselves extremely beholden to you and are apt to return the favour by a like moderation and facility on their part to be furious and passionate they know would only gain them the character of shameless mercenaries not that of zealous patriots which is the character that such a warm behaviour is apt to acquire to the other party in all controversies we find without regarding the truth or falshood on either side that those who defend the established and popular opinions are always the most dogmatical and imperious in their stile while their adversaries affect almost extraordinary gentleness and moderation in order to soften as much as possible any prejudices that may lye against them consider the behavior of our freethinkers of all denominations whether they be such as decry all revelation or only oppose the exorbitant power of the clergy collins tindal foster hoadley compare their moderation and good manners with the furious zeal and scurrility of their adversaries and you will be convinced of the truth of my observation a like difference may be observed in the conduct of those french writers who maintained the controversy with regard to ancient and modern learning boileau monsieur and madame dacier labbé de bos who defended the party of the ancients mixed their reasonings with satire and invective while fontenelle la motte charpentier and even perrault never transgressed the bounds of moderation and good breeding though provoked by the most injurious treatment of their adversaries must however observe that this remark with regard to the seeming moderation of the court party is entirely confind to conversation and to gentlemen who have been engagd by interest or inclination in that party for as to the courtwriters being commonly hird scriblers they are altogether as scurrilous as the mercenaries of the other party nor has the gazeteer any advantage in this respect above common sense a man of education will in any party discover himself to be such by his goodbreeding and decency as a scoundrel will always betray the opposite qualities the false accusers accusd c is very scurrillous tho that side of the question being least popular shoud be defended with most moderation when ld be ld mt mr ln take the pen in hand tho they write with warmth they presume not upon their popularity so far as to transgress the bounds of decency this paragraph is found only in editions a and b am led into this train of reflection by considering some papers wrote upon that grand topic of court influence and parliamentary dependence where in my humble opinion the country party besides vehemence and satyre shew too rigid an inflexibility and too great a jealousy of making concessions to their adversaries their reasonings lose their force by being carried too far and the popularity of their opinions has seduced them to neglect in some measure their justness and solidity the following reason will hope serve to justify me in this opinion kso the essay concludes in editions q and r in place of the last paragraph the preceding editions read as follows tis however remarkable that tho the principles of whig and tory were both of them of a compound nature yet the ingredients which predominated in both were not correspondent to each other a tory loved monarchy and bore an affection to the family of stuart but the latter affection was the predominant inclination of the party a whig loved liberty and was a friend to the settlement in the protestant line but the love of liberty was professedly his predominant inclination the tories have frequently acted as republicans where either policy or revenge has engaged them to that conduct and there was no one of that party who upon the supposition that he was to be disappointed in his views with regard to the succession would not have desired to impose the strictest limitations on the crown and to bring our form of government as near republican as possible in order to depress the family which according to his apprehension succeeded without any just title the whigs tis true have also taken steps dangerous to liberty under colour of securing the succession and settlement of the crown according to their views but as the body of the party had no passion for that succession otherwise than as the means of securing liberty they have been betrayed into these steps by ignorance or frailty or the interests of their leaders the succession of the crown was therefore the chief point with the tories the security of our liberties with the whigs the remainder of this paragraph is not in a and b nor is this seeming irregularity at all difficult to be accounted for by our present theory court and country parties are the true parents of tory and whig but tis almost impossible that the attachment of the court party to monarchy should not degenerate into an attachment to the monarch there being so close a connexion between them and the latter being so much the more natural object how easily does the worship of the divinity degenerate into a worship of the idol the connexion is not so great between liberty the divinity of the old country party or whigs and any monarch or royal family nor is it so reasonable to suppose that in that party the worship can be so easily transferred from the one to the other tho even that would be no great miracle tis difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and sentiments of any particular man but tis almost impossible to distinguish those of a whole party where it often happens that no two persons agree precisely in the same maxims of conduct yet will venture to affirm that it was not so much principle or an opinion of indefeasible right which attached the tories to the ancient royal family as affection or a certain love and esteem for their persons the same cause divided england formerly between the houses of york and lancaster and scotland between the families of bruce and baliol in an age when political disputes were but little in fashion and when political principles must of course have had but little influence on mankind the doctrine of passive obedience is so absurd in itself and so opposite to our liberties that it seems to have been chiefly left to pulpitdeclaimers and to their deluded followers among the vulgar men of better sense were guided by affection and as to the leaders of this party tis probable that interest was their chief motive and that they acted more contrary to their private sentiments than the leaders of the opposite party the remainder of this paragraph is not in a and b tho tis almost impossible to maintain with zeal the right of any person or family without acquiring a goodwill to them and changing the principle into affection yet this is less natural to people of an elevated station and liberal education who have had full opportunity of observing the weakness folly and arrogance of monarchs and have found them to be nothing superior if not rather inferior to the rest of mankind the interest therefore of being heads of a party does often with such people supply the place both of principle and affection some who will not venture to assert that the real difference between whig and tory was lost at the revolution seem inclined to think that the difference is now abolished and that affairs are so far returned to their natural state that there are at present no other parties amongst us but court and country that is men who by interest or principle are attached either to monarchy or to liberty it must indeed be confest that the tory party seem of late to have decayed much in their numbers still more in their zeal and may venture to say still more in their credit and authority there are few men of knowledge or learning at least few philosophers since mr locke has wrote who would not be ashamed to be thought of that party and in almost all companies the name of old whig is mentioned as an uncontestable appellation of honour and dignity accordingly the enemies of the ministry as a reproach call the courtiers the true tories and as an honour denominate the gentlemen in the opposition the true whigs the last two sentences were omitted in p a and b read no man omitting at least wrote the tories have been so long obliged to talk in the republican stile that they seem to have made converts of themselves by their hypocrisy and to have embraced the sentiments as well as language of their adversaries there are however very considerable remains of that party in england with all their old prejudices and a proof that court and country are not our only parties is that almost all the dissenters side with the court and the lower clergy at least of the church of england with the opposition this may convince us that some biass still hangs upon our constitution some intrinsic weight which turns it from its natural course and causes a confusion in our parties this sentence does not occur in a shall conclude this subject with observing that we never had any tories in scotland according to the proper signification of the word and that the division of parties in this country was really into whigs and jacobites a jacobite seems to be a tory who has no regard to the constitution but is either a zealous partizan of absolute monarchy or at least willing to sacrifice our liberties to the obtaining the succession in that family to which he is attached the reason of the difference between england and scotland take to be this political and religious divisions in the latter country have been since the revolution regularly correspondent to each other the presbyterians were all whigs without exception those who favoured episcopacy of the opposite party and as the clergy of the latter sect were turned out of the churches at the revolution they had no motive for making any compliances with the government in their oaths or their forms of prayers but openly avowed the highest principles of their party which is the cause why their followers have been more violent than their brethren of the tory party in england as violent things have not commonly so long a duration as moderate we actually find that the jacobite party is almost entirely vanishd from among us and that the distinction of court and country which is but creeping in at london is the only one that is ever mentiond in this kingdom beside the violence and openness of the jacobite party another reason has perhaps contributed to produce so sudden and so visible an alteration in this part of britain there are only two ranks of men among us gentlemen who have some fortune and education and the meanest slaving poor without any considerable number of that middling rank of men which abounds more in england both in cities and in the country than in any other part of the world the slaving poor are incapable of any principles gentlemen may be converted to true principles by time and experience the middling rank of men have curiosity and knowledge enough to form principles but not enough to form true ones or correct any prejudices that they may have imbibd and tis among the middling rank that tory principles do at present prevail most in england this final paragraph appears only in a and b ain editions a and b this and the three next paragraphs were written as follows my first reflection is that religions which partake of enthusiasm are on their first rise much more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition but in a little time become much more gentle and moderate the violence of this species of religion when excited by novelty and animated by opposition appears from numberless instances of the anabaptists in germany the camisars in france the levellers and other fanaticks in england and the covenanters in scotland as enthusiasm is founded on strong spirits and a presumptuous boldness of character it naturally begets the most extreme resolutions especially after it rises to that height as to inspire the deluded fanaticks with the opinion of divine illuminations and with a contempt of the common rules of reason morality and prudence tis thus enthusiasm produces the most cruel desolation in human society but its fury is like that of thunder and tempest which exhaust themselves in a little time and leave the air more calm and serene than before the reason of this will appear evidently by comparing enthusiasm to superstition the other species of false religion and tracing the natural consequences of each as superstition is founded on fear sorrow and a depression of spirits it represents the person to himself in such despicable colours that he appears unworthy in his own eyes of approaching the divine presence and naturally has recourse to any other person whose sanctity of life or perhaps impudence and cunning have made him be supposed to be more favoured by the divinity to him they entrust their devotions to his care they recommend their prayers petitions and sacrifices and by his means hope to render their addresses acceptable to their incensed deity hence the origin of priests who may justly be regarded as one of the grossest inventions of a timorous and abject superstition which ever diffident of itself dares not offer up its own devotions but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to the divinity by the mediation of his supposed friends and servants as superstition is a considerable ingredient of almost all religions even the most fanatical there being nothing but philosophy able to conquer entirely these unaccountable terrors hence it proceeds that in almost every sect of religion there are priests to be found but the stronger mixture there is of superstition the higher is the authority of the priesthood modern judaism and popery especially the latter being the most barbarous and absurd superstitions that have yet been known in the world are the most enslavd by their priests as the church of england may justly be said to retain a strong mixture of popish superstition it partakes also in its original constitution of a propensity to priestly power and dominion particularly in the respect it exacts to the priest and though according to the sentiments of that church the prayers of the priest must be accompanied with those of the laity yet is he the mouth of the congregation his person is sacred and without his presence few would think their public devotions or the sacraments and other rites acceptable to the divinity on the other hand it may be observed that all enthusiasts have been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have exprest a great independence in their devotion with a contempt of forms tradition and authorities the quakers are the most egregious tho at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts that have been yet known and are perhaps the only sect that have never admitted priests among them the independents of all the english sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage the presbyterians follow after at an equal distance in both these particulars in short this observation is founded on the most certain experience and will also appear to be founded on reason if we consider that as enthusiasm arises from a presumptuous pride and confidence it thinks itself sufficiently qualified to approach the divinity without any human mediator its rapturous devotions are so fervent that it even imagines itself actually to approach him by the way of contemplation and inward converse which makes it neglect all those outward ceremonies and observances to which the assistance of the priests appears so requisite in the eyes of their superstitious votaries the fanatick consecrates himself and bestows on his own person a sacred character much superior to what forms and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other tis therefore an infallible rule that superstition is favourable to priestly power and euthusiasm as much or rather more contrary to it than sound reason and philosophy the consequences are evident when the first fire of enthusiasm is spent men naturally in such fanatical sects sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matters there being no body of men amongst them endowd with sufficient authority whose interest is concerned to support the religious spirit superstition on the contrary steals in gradually and insensibly renders men tame and submissive is acceptable to the magistrate and seems inoffensive to the people till at last the priest having firmly establishd his authority becomes the tyrant and disturber of human society by his endless contentions persecutions and religious wars how smoothly did the romish church advance in their acquisition of power but into what dismal convulsions did they throw all europe in order to maintain it on the other hand our sectaries who were formerly such dangerous bigots are now become our greatest freethinkers and the quakers are perhaps the only regular body of deists in the universe except the literati or disciples of confucius in china gc to p proceed have confest that there is something accidental in the origin and progress of the arts in any nation and yet cannot forbear thinking that if the other learned and polite nations of europe had possest the same advantages of a popular government they would probably have carried eloquence to a greater height than it has yet reached in britain the french sermons especially those of flechier and bossuet are much superior to the english in this particular and in both these authors are found many strokes of the most sublime poetry and and in flechier there are found many strokes of the most sublime poetry his funeral sermon on the marechal de turenne is a good instance none but private causes in that country are ever debated before their parliaments or courts of judicature but notwithstanding this disadvantage there appears a spirit of eloquence in many of their lawyers which with proper cultivation and encouragement might rise to the greatest height the pleadings of patru are very elegant and give us room to imagine what so fine a genius could have performed in questions concerning public liberty or slavery peace or war who exerts himself with such success in debates concerning the price of an old horse or a gossiping story of a quarrel between an abbess and her nuns for tis remarkable that this polite writer tho esteemed by all the men of wit in his time was never employed in the most considerable causes of their courts of judicature but lived and died in poverty from an ancient prejudice industriously propagated by the dunces in all countries that a man of genius is unfit for business the disorders produced by the factions against cardinal mazarine made the parliament of paris enter into the discussion of public affairs and during that short interval there appeared many symptoms of the revival of ancient eloquence the avocat generaltalon in an oration invoked on his knees the spirit of st louis to look down with compassion on his divided and unhappy people and to inspire them from above with the love of concord and unanimity the members of the french academy have attempted to give us models of eloquence in their harangues at their admittance but having no subject to discourse upon they have run altogether into a fulsome strain of panegyric and flattery the most barren of all subjects their stile however is commonly on these occasions very elevated and sublime and might reach the greatest heights were it employed on a subject more favourable and engaging there are some circumstances confess in the english temper and genius which are disadvantageous to the progress of eloquence and render all attempts of that kind more dangerous and difficult among them than among any other nation the english are conspicuous for goodsense which makes them very jealous of any attempts to deceive them by the flowers of rhetoric and elocution they are also peculiarly modest which makes them consider it as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing but reason to public assemblies or attempt to guide them by passion or fancy may perhaps be allowed to add that the people in general are not remarkable for delicacy of taste or for sensibility to the charms of the muses their musical parts to use the expression of a noble author are but indifferent hence their comic poets to move them must have recourse to obscenity their tragic poets to blood and slaughter and hence their orators being deprived of any such resource have abandoned altogether the hopes of moving them and have confined themselves to plain argument and reasoning these circumstances joined to particular accidents may perhaps have retarded the growth of eloquence in this kingdom but will not be able to prevent its success if ever it appear amongst us and one may safely pronounce that this is a field in which the most flourishing laurels may yet be gathered if any youth of accomplished genius thoroughly acquainted with all the polite arts and not ignorant of public business should appear in parliament and accustom our ears to an eloquence more commanding and pathetic and to confirm me in this opinion there occur two considerations the one derived from ancient the other from modern times jeditions to p insert tis but an indifferent compliment which horace pays to his friend grosphus in the ode addressed to him no one says he is happy in every respect and may perhaps enjoy some advantages which you are deprived of you possess great riches your bellowing herds cover thesicilianplains your chariot is drawn by the finest horses and you are arrayed in the richest purple but the indulgent fates with a small inheritance have givenmea fine genius and have endowed me with a contempt for the malignant judgments of the vulgarphædrus says to his patron eutychus if you intend to read my works shall be pleased if not shall at least have the advantage of pleasing posterity am apt to think that a modern poet would not have been guilty of such an impropriety as that which may be observed in virgils address to augustus when after a great deal of extravagant flattery and after having deified the emperor according to the custom of those times he at last places this god on the same level with himself by your gracious nod says he render my undertaking prosperous and taking pity together with me of the swains ignorant of husbandry bestow your favourable influence on this work had men in that age been accustomed to observe such niceties a writer so delicate as virgil would certainly have given a different turn to this sentence the court of augustus however polite had not yet it seems worn off the manners of the republic feditions to p add as follows if a spanish lady must not be supposed to have legs what must be supposed of a turkish lady she must not be supposed to have a being at all accordingly tis esteemed a piece of rudeness and indecency at constantinople ever to make mention of a mans wives before him in europe tis true fine bred people make it also a rule never to talk of their wives but the reason is not founded on our jealousy suppose it is because we should be apt were it not for this rule to become troublesome to company by talking too much of them the author of the persian letters has given a different reason for this polite maxim men says he never care to mention their wives in company lest they should talk of them before people who are better acquainted with them than themselves beditions h to p proceed as follows europe has now for above a century remained on the defensive against the greatest force that ever perhaps was formed by the civil or political combination of mankind and such is the influence of the maxim here treated of that tho that ambitious nation in the five last general wars have been victorious in four and unsuccessful only in one they have not much enlarged their dominions nor acquired a total ascendant over europe there remains rather room to hope that by maintaining the resistance for some time the natural revolutions of human affairs together with unforeseen events and accidents may guard us against universal monarchy and preserve the world from so great an evil in the three last of these general wars britain has stood foremost in the glorious struggle and she still maintains her station as guardian of the general liberties of europe and patron of mankind beditions h to p insert as follows tis always observed in years of scarcity if it be not extreme that the poor labour more and really live better than in years of great plenty when they indulge themselves in idleness and riot have been told by a considerable manufacturer that in the year when bread and provisions of all kinds were very dear his workmen not only made a shift to live but paid debts which they had contracted in former years that were much more favourable and abundant this doctrine therefore with regard to taxes may be admitted in some degree but beware of the abuse exorbitant taxes like extreme necessity destroy industry by producing despair and even before they reach this pitch they raise the wages of the labourer and manufacturer and heighten the price of all commodities an attentive disinterested legislature will observe the point when the emolument ceases and the prejudice begins but as the contrary character is much more common tis to be feared that taxes all over europe are multiplying to such a degree as will intirely crush all art and industry tho perhaps their first increase together with other circumstances might have contributed to the growth of these advantages deditions h to p add there is a word which is here in the mouth of every body and which find has also got abroad and is much employed by foreign writers in imitation of the english and this is circulation this word serves as an account of every thing and though confess that have sought for its meaning in the present subject ever since was a schoolboy have never yet been able to discover it what possible advantage is there which the nation can reap by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand or is there any parallel to be drawn from the circulation of other commodities to that of chequernotes and india bonds where a manufacturer has a quick sale of his goods to the merchant the merchant to the shopkeeper the shopkeeper to his customers this enlivens industry and gives new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen and makes them produce more and better commodities of the same species a stagnation is here pernicious wherever it happens because it operates backwards and stops or benumbs the industrious hand in its production of what is useful to human life but what production we owe to changealley or even what consumption except that of coffee and pen ink and paper have not yet learned nor can one forsee the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity though that place and all its inhabitants were for ever buried in the ocean but though this term has never been explained by those who insist so much on the advantages that result from a circulation there seems however to be some benefit of a similiar kind arising from our incumbrances as indeed what human evil is there which is not attended with some advantage this we shall endeavour to explain that we may estimate the weight which we ought to allow it leditions h to p add could folards project of the column take place which seems impracticable it would render modern battles as destructive as the antient weditions h to proceed as follows the critical art may very justly be suspected of temerity when it pretends to correct or dispute the plain testimony of ancient historians by any probable or analogical reasonings yet the licence of authors upon all subjects particularly with regard to numbers is so great that we ought still to retain a kind of doubt or reserve whenever the facts advanced depart in the least from the common bounds of nature and experience shall give an instance with regard to modern history sir william temple tells us in his memoirs that having a free conversation with charles the he took the opportunity of representing to that monarch the impossibility of introducing into this island the religion and government of france chiefly on account of the great force requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people the romans says he were forced to keep up twelve legions for that purpose a great absurdity and cromwell left an army of near eighty thousand men must not this last be regarded as unquestioned by future critics when they find it asserted by a wise and learned minister of state cotemporary to the fact and who addressed his discourse upon an ungrateful subject to a great monarch who was also cotemporary and who himself broke those very forces about fourteen years before yet by the most undoubted authority we may insist that cromwells army when he died did not amount to half the number here mentioned bfor this sentence and the next editions h to p read as follows k to p in a note it appears from the speeches and proclamations and whole train of king james is actions as well as his sons that they considered the english government as a simple monarchy and never imagined that any considerable part of their subjects entertained a contrary idea this made them discover their pretensions without preparing any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which are always employed by those who enter upon any new project or endeavour to innovate in any government king james told his parliament plainly when they meddled in state affairs ne sutor ultra crepidam he used also at his table in promiscuous companies to advance his notions in a manner still more undisguised as we may learn from a story told in the life of mr waller and which that poet used frequently to repeat when mr waller was young he had the curiosity to go to court and he stood in the circle and saw king james dine where amongst other company there sat at table two bishops the king openly and aloud proposed this question whether he might not take his subjects money when he had occasion for it without all this formality of parliament the one bishop readily replied god forbid you should not for you are the breath of our nostrils the other bishop declined answering and said he was not skilled in parliamentary cases but upon the kings urging him and saying he would admit of no evasion his lordship replied very pleasantly why then think your majesty may lawfully take my brothers money for he offers it in sir walter raleighs preface to the history of the world there is this remarkable passage philip by strong hand and main force attempted to make himself not only an absolute monarch over the netherlands like unto the kings and sovereigns of england and france but turklike to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws privileges and antient rightsspenser speaking of some grants of the english kings to the irish corporations says all which tho at the time of their first grant they were tolerable and perhaps reasonable yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient but all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her majestys prerogative against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or inforced state ofireland p edit as these were very common if not perhaps the universal notions of the times the two first princes of the house of stuart were the more excusable for their mistake and rapin suitable to his usual malignity and partiality seems to treat them with too much severity upon account of it geditions h to p insert the following paragraph in the last war it has been of service to us by furnishing us with a considerable body of auxiliary troops the bravest and most faithful in the world the elector of hanover is the only considerable prince in the empire who has pursued no separate end and has raised up no stale pretensions during the late commotions of europe but has acted all along with the dignity of a king of britain and ever since the accession of that family it would be difficult to show any harm we have ever received from the electoral dominions except that short disgust in with charles who regulating himself by maxims very different from those of other princes made a personal quarrel of every public injury miscellaneous reflections some of the opinions delivered in these essays with regard to the public transactions in the last century the author on more accurate examination found reason to retract in his history of great britain and as he would not enslave himself to the systems of either party neither would he fetter his judgment by his own preconceived opinions and principles nor is he ashamed to acknowledge his mistakes this note does not occur in any edition prior to by priests understand only the pretenders to power and dominion and to a superior sanctity of character distinct from virtue and good morals these are very different from clergymen who are set apart by the laws added in edition b to the care of sacred matters and the conducting our public devotions with greater

that this reasoning from single passages of ancient authors may seem fallacious and that the foregoing arguments cannot have great force but with those who are well acquainted with these writers and
