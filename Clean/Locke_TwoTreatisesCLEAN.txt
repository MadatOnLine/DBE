two treatises of government in the former the false principles and foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers be detect and overthrow the latter be an essay concern the original extent and end of civil government john locke the preface reader thou hast here the begin and end of a discourse concern government what fate have otherwise dispose of the paper that should have fill up the middle and be more than all the rest it be not worth while to tell thee these which remain i hope be sufficient to establish the throne of our great restorer our present king william to make good his title in else consent of the people which be the only one of all lawful governments he have more fully and clearly than any prince in christendom and to justify to the world the people of england whose love of their just and natural right with their resolution to preserve them save the nation when it war on the very brink of slavery and ruin if these paper have that evidence i flatter myself be to be find in them there will be no great miss of those which be lose and my reader may be satisfy without them for i imagine i shall have neither the time nor inclination to repeat my pain and fill up the want part of my answer by trace sir robert again through all the wind and obscurities which be to be meet with in the several branch of his wonderful system the king and body of the nation have since so thoroughly confute his hypothesis that i suppose nobody hereafter will have either the confidence to appear against our common safety and be again an advocate for slavery or the weakness to be deceive with contradictions dress up in a popular style and well turn periods for if any one will be at the pain himself in those part which be here untouched to strip sir roberts discourse of the flourish of doubtful expressions and endeavour to reduce his word to direct positive intelligible proposition and then compare them one with another he will quickly be satisfy there be never so much glib nonsense put together in well sound english if he think it not worth while to examine his work all through let him make an experiment in that part where he treat of usurpation and let him try whether he can with all his skill make sir robert intelligible and consistent with himself or common sense i should not speak so plainly of a gentleman long since past answer have not the pulpit of late years publicly own his doctrine and make it the current divinity of the time it be necessary those men who take on them to be teachers have so dangerously mislead others should be openly show of what authority this their patriarch be whom they have so blindly follow that so they may either retract what upon so ill ground they have vent and can not be maintain or else justify those principles which they have preach up for gospel though they have no better an author than an english courtier for i should not have writ against sir robert or take the pain to show his mistake inconsistencies and avant of what he so much boast of and pretend wholly to build on scriptureproofs be there not men amongst us who by cry up his book and espouse his doctrine save me from the reproach of write against a dead adversary they have be so zealous in this point that if i have do him any wrong i can not hope they should spare me i wish where they have do the truth and the public wrong they would be as ready to redress it and allow its just weight to this reflection viz that there can not be do a greater mischief to prince and people than the propagate wrong notions concern government that so at last all time might not have reason to complain of the drum ecclesiastic if any one really concern for truth undertake the confutation of my hypothesis i promise him either to recant my mistake upon fair conviction or to answer his difficulties but he must remember two things first that cavil here and there at some expression or little incident of my discourse be not an answer to my book secondly that i shall not take rail for arguments nor think either of these worth my notice though i shall always look on myself as bind to give satisfaction to any one who shall appear to be conscientiously scrupulous in the point and shall show any just ground for his scruple i have nothing more but to advertise the reader that a stand for our author o for his observations on hobbes milton c and that a bare quotation of page always mean page of his patriarcha edit slavery be so vile and miserable an estate of man and so directly opposite to the generous temper and courage of our nation that it be hardly to be conceive that an englishman much less a gentleman should plead for it and truly i should have take sir robert filmers patriarcha as any other treatise which would persuade all mere that they be slave and ought to be so for such another exercise of wit as be his who writ the encomium of nero rather than for a serious discourse mean in earnest have not the gravity of the title and epistle the picture in the front of the book and the applause that follow it require me to believe that the author and publisher be both in earnest i therefore take it into my hand with all the expectation and read it through with all the attention due to a treatise that make such a noise at its come abroad and can not but confess myself mightily surprise that in a book which be to provide chain for all mankind i should find nothing but a rope of sand useful perhaps to such whose skill and business it be to wise a dust and would blind the people the better to mislead them but in truth not of any force to draw those into bondage who have their eye open and so much sense about them as to consider that chain be but an ill wear how much care soever hath be take to file and polish them if any one think i take too much liberty in speak so freely of a man who be the great champion of absolute power and the idol of those who worship it i beseech him to make this small allowance for once to one who even after the read of sir roberts book can not but think himself as the laws allow him a free man and i know no fault it be to do so unless any one better skilled in the fate of it than i should have it reveal to him that this treatise which have lie dormant so long be the false principles and foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers be detect and overthrow plan it appear in the world to carry by strength of its arguments all liberty out or it and that from thenceforth our author short model be to be the pattern in the mount and the perfect standard of politics for the future his system lie in a little compass it be no more but this that all government be absolute monarchy and the grind he build on be this that no man be bear free in this last age a generation of men have spring up amongst us that would flatter princes with an opinion that they have a divine right to absolute power let the laws by which they be constitute and be to govern and the condition under which they enter upon their authority be what they will and their engagements to observe them ever so well ratify by solemn oaths and promise to make way for this doctrine they have deny mankind a right to natural freedom whereby they have not only as much as in them lie expose all subject to the utmost misery of tyranny and oppression but have also unsettle the title and shake the throne of princes for they too by these mens system except only one be all bear slave and by divine right be subject to adams right heir as if they have design to make war upon all government and subvert the very foundations of human society to serve their present turn however we must believe them upon their own bare word when they tell us we be all bear slave and we must continue so there be no remedy for it life and thraldom we enter into together and can never be quit of the one till we part with the other scripture or reason i be sure do not any where say so notwithstanding the noise of divine right as if divine authority hath subject us to the unlimited will of another an admirable state of mankind and that which they have not lead wit enough to find out till this latter age for however sir robert filmier seem to condemn the novelty of the contrary opinion patr p yet i believe it will be hard for him to find any other age or country of the world but this which have assert monarchy to be jure divine and he confess patr p that heyward blackwood barclay and others that have bravely vindicate the right of kings in most point never think of this but with one consent admit the natural liberty and equality of mankind by whom this doctrine come at first to be broach and bring in fashion amongst us and what sad elect it give rise to i leave to historians to relate or to the memory of those who be contemporaries with sibthorp and manwaring to recollect my business at present be only to consider what sir robert filmer who be allow to have carry this argument farthest and be suppose to have bring it to perfection have say in it for from him every one who would be as fashionable as french be at court have learn and run away with this short system of politics viz men be not bear free and therefore could never have the liberty to choose either governors or form of government princes have their power absolute and by divine right for slave could never have a right to compact or consent adam be an absolute monarch and so be all princes ever since of paternal and regal power sir robert filmers great position be that men be not naturally free this be the foundation on which his absolute monarchy stand and from which it erect itself to an height that its power be above every power caput inter nubilia so high above all earthly and human things that think can scarce reach it that promise and oaths which tie the infinite deity can not confine it but if this foundation fail all his fabric fall with it and governments must be leave again to the old way of be make by contrivance and the consent of men anqrwp nh ct sij make use of their reason to unite together into society to prove this grand position of his he tell us p men be bear in subjection to their parent and therefore can not be free and this authority of parent he call royal authority p fatherly authority right of fatherhood p one would have think he would in the begin of such a work as this on which be to depend the authority of princes and the obedience of subject have tell us expressly what that fatherly authority be have definer it though not limit it because in some other treatises of his he tell us it be unlimited and unlimitable he should at least have give us such an account of it that we might have have an entire notion of this fatherhood or fatherly authority whenever it come in our way in his write this i expect to have find in the first chapter of his patriarchal but instead thereof have en passant make his obeisance to the arcana imperii p make his compliment to the right and liberties of this or any other nation p which he be go presently to null and destroy and make his leg to those learn men who do not see so far into the matter as himself p he come to fall on bellarmine p and by a victory over him estab lishes his fatherly authority beyond any question bellarmine be rout by his own confession p the day be clear get and there be no more need of any force for have do that i observe not that he state the question or rally up any arguments to make good his opinion but rather tell us the story as he think fit of this strange kind of domineer phantom call the fatherhood which whoever could catch presently get empire and unlimited absolute power he acquaint us how this fatherhood liege in adam continue its course and keep the world in order all the time of the patriarchs till the flood get out of the ark with noah and his sons make and support all the kings of the earth till the captivity of the israelites in egypt and then the poor fatherhood be under hatch till god by give the israelites kings reestablish the ancient and prime right of the lineal succession in paternal government this be his business from p to and then obviate au objection and clear a difficulty or two with onehalf reason p to confirm the natural right of regal power he end the first chapter i hope it be no injury to call an half quotation an half reason for god say honour thy father and mother but our author content himself with half leave out thy mother quite as little serviceable to his purpose but of that more in another place i do not think our author so little skilled in the way of write discourse of this nature nor so careless of the point in hand that he by oversight commit the fault that he himself in his anarchy of a mix monarchy p object to mr hunton in these word where first i charge the a that he hath not give us any definition or description of monarchy in general for by the rule of method he should have first define and by the like rule of method sir robert should have tell us what his fatherhood or fatherly authority be before he have tell us in whom it w as to be find and talk so much of it but perhaps sir robert find that this fatherly authority this power of father and of kings for he make them both the same p would make a very odd and frightful figure and very disagree with what either children imagine of their parent or subject of their kings if he should have give us the whole draught together in that gigantic form he have paint it in his own fancy and therefore like a wary physician when he would have his patient swallow some harsh or corrosive liquor he mingle it with a large quantity of that which may dilute it that the scatter part may go down with less feel and cause less aversion let us then endeavour to find what account he give us of this fatherly authority as it lie scatter in the several part of his write and first as it be vest in adam he say not only adam but the succeed patriarchs have by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children p this lordship which adam by command have over the wholes world and by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy be as large and ample as the absolute dominion of any monarch which hath be since the creation p dominion of life and death make war and conclude peace p adam and the patriarchs have absolute power of life and death p kings in the right of parent succeed to the exercise of supreme jurisdiction p as kingly power be by the law of god so it hath no inferior law to limit it adam be lord of all p the father of a family govern by no other law than by his own will p the superiority of princes be above laws p the unlimited jurisdiction of kings be so amply describe by samuel p kings be above the laws p and to this purpose see a great deal more which our a deliver in bodins word it be certain that all laws privilege and grant of princes have no force but during their life if they be not ratify by the express consent or by sufferance of the prince follow especially privilege o p the reason why laws have be also make by kings be this when kings be either busy with war or distract with public care so that every private man could not have access to their persons to learn their will and pleasure then be laws of necessity invent that so every particular subject might find his princes pleasure decipher unto him in the table of his laws p in a monarchy the lie must by necessity be above the laws p a perfect kingdom be that wherein the king rule all things accord to his own will p neither common nor statute laws be or can be any diminution of that general power which kings have over their peon pie by right of fatherhood p adam be the father king and lord over his family a son a subject and a servant or slave be one and the same thing at first the father have power to dispose or sell his children or servants whence we find that in the first reckon up of goods in scripture the manservant and the maidservant be number among the possessions and substance of the owner as other goods be o pref god also hath give to the father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other whence we find the sale and gift of children to have be much in use in the begin of the world when men have their servants for a possession and an inheritance as well as other goods whereupon we find the power of castrate and make eunuchs much in use in old time o p law be nothing else but the will of him that hath the power of the supreme father o p it be gods ordinance that the supremacy should be unlimited in adam and as large as all the act of his will and as in him so in all others that have supreme power o p i have be fain to trouble my reader with these several quotations in our as own word that in them might be see his own description of his fatherly authority as it lie scatter up and down in his write which he suppose be first vest in adam and by right belong to all princes ever since this fatherly authority there or right of fatherhood in our as sense be a divine unalterable right of sovereignty whereby a father or a prince hath an absolute arbitrary unlimited and unlimitable power over the live liberties and estates of his children and subject so that he may take or alienate their estates sell castrate or use their persons as he please they be all his slave and he lord or proprietor of every thing and his unbounded will their law our a have place such a mighty power in adam and upon that supposition found all government and all power of princes it be reasonable to expect that he should have prove this with arguments clear and evident suitable to the weightiness of the cause that since men have nothing else leave them they might in slavery have such undeniable proof of its necessity that their consciences might be convince and oblige them to submit peaceably to that absolute dominion which their governors have a right to exercise over them without this what good could our a do or pretend to do by erect such an unlimited power but flatter the natural vanity and ambition of men too apt of itself to grow and increase with the possession of any power and by persuade those who by the consent of their fellowmen be advance to great but limit degrees of it that by that part which be give them they have a right to all that be not so and therefore may do what they please because they have authority to do more than others and so tempt them to do what be neither for their own nor the good of those under their care whereby great mischief can not but follow the sovereignty of adam be that on which as a sure basis our a build his mighty absolute monarchy i expect that in his patriarcha this his main supposition would have be prove and establish with all that evidence of arguments that such a fundamental tenet require and that this which the great stress of the business depend would have be make out with reason sufficient to justify the confidence with which it be assume but in all that treatise i could find very little tend that way the thing be there so take for grant without proof that i could scarce believe myself when upon attentive read that treatise i find there so mighty a structure raise upon the bare supposition of this foundation for it be scarce credible that in a discourse where he pretend to confute the erroneous principle of man natural freedom he should do it by a bare supposition of adams authority without offer any proof for that authority indeed he confidently say that adam have royal authority p and absolute lordship and dominion of life and death p an universal monarchy p absolute power of life and death p he be very frequent in such assertions but what be strange in all his whole patriarcha i find not one presence of a reason to establish this his great foundation of government not any thing that look like an argument but these word to confirm this natural right of regal power we find in the decalogue that the law which enjoin obedience to kings be deliver ill the term honour thy father as if all power be originally in the father and why may i not add as well that in the decalogue the law that enjoin obedience to queen be deliver in the term of honour thy mother as if all power be originally in the mother the argument as sir robert put it will hold as well for one as the other but of this more in its due place all that i take notice of here be that this be all our a say in this first or any of the follow chapters to prove the absolute power of adam which be his great principle and yet as if he have there settle it upon sure demonstration he begin his second chapter with these word by confer these proof and reason draw from the authority of the scripture where those proof and reason for adams sovereignty be bat that of honour thy father abovementioned i confess i can not find unless what he say p in these word we have an evident confession viz of bellarmine that creation make man prince of his posterity must be take for proof and reason draw from scripture or for any sort of proof at all though from thence by a new way of inference in the word immediately follow he conclude the royal authority of adam sufficiently settle in him if he have in that chapter or any where in the whole treatise give any other proof of adams royal authority other than by often repeat it which among some men go for argument i desire any body for him to show me the place and page that i may be convince of my mistake and acknowledge my oversight if no such arguments be to be find i beseech those men who have so much cry up this book to consider whether they do not give the world cause to suspect that it be not the force of reason and argument that make them for absolute monarchy but some other by interest and therefore be resolve to applaud any author that write in favour of this doctrine whether he support it with reason or no but i hope they do not expect that rational and indifferent men should be bring over to their opinion because this their great doctor of it in a discourse make on purpose to set up the absolute monarchical power of adam in opposition to the natural freedom of mankind have say so little to prove it from whence it be rather naturally to be conclude that there be little to be say but that i might omit no care to inform myself in our author full sense i consult his observations on aristotle hobbes c to see whether in dispute with others he make use of any arguments for this his darling tenet of adams sovereignty since in his treatise of the natural power of kings he hath be so spar of them in his observations on mr hobbess leviathan i think he have put in short all those arguments for it together which in his write i find him any where to make use of his word be these if god create only adam and of a piece of him make the woman and if by generation from them two as part of them all mankind be propagate if also god give to adam not only the dominion over the woman and the children that should issue from them but also over all the earth to subdue it and over all the creatures on it so that as long as adam live no man could claim or enjoy any thing but by donation assignation or permission from him i wonder c obs here we have the sum of all his arguments for adams sovereignty and against natural freedom which i find up and down in his other treatises and they be these follow god s creation of adam the dominion he give him over eve an the dominion he have as father over his children all which i shall particularly consider of adams title to sovereignty by creation sir robert in his preface to his observations on aristotles politics tell us a natural freedom of mankind can not be suppose without the denial of the creation of adam but how adams be create which be nothing but his receive a be immediately from omnipotency and the hand of god give adam a sovereignty over any thing i can not see nor consequently understand how a supposition of natural freedom be a denial of adams creation and would be glad any body else since our a do not vouchsafe us the favour would make it out for him for i find no difficulty to suppose the freedom of mankind though i have always believe the creation of adam he be create or begin to exist by gods immediate power without the intervention of parent or the preexistence of any of the same species to beget him when it please god he should and so do the lion the king of beasts before him by the same create power of god and if bare existence by that power and in that way will give dominion without any more ado our a by this argument will make the hon have as good a title to it as he and certainly the ancienter no for adam have his title by the appointment of god say our a in another place then bare creation give him not dominion and one might have suppose mankind free without the deny the creation of adam since it be gods appointment make him monarch but let us see how he put his creation and this appointment together by the appointment of god say sir robert as soon as adam be create he be monarch of the world though he have no subject for though there could not be actual government till there be subject yet by the right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity though not in act yet at least in habit adam be a king from his creation i wish he have tell us here what he mean by gods appointment for whatsoever providence order or the law of nature direct or positive revelation declare may be say to be by god s appointment but i suppose it can not be mean here in the first sense ie by providence because that would be to say no more but that as soon as adam be create he be de facto monarch because by right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity but he could not de facto be by providence constitute the governor of the world at a time when there be actually no government no subject to be govern which our a here confess monarch of the world be also differently use by our a for sometimes he mean by it a proprietor of all the world exclusive of the rest of mankind and thus he do in the same page of his preface before cite adam say he be command to multiply and people the earth and subdue it and have dominion give him over all creatures be thereby the monarch of the whole world none of his posterity have any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him let us understand then by monarch proprietor of the world and by appointment gods actual donation and reveal positive grant make to adam gen i as we see sir robert himself do in this parallel place and then his argument will tend thus by the positive grant of god as soon as adam be create he be proprietor of the world because by the right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity in which way of argue there be two manifest falsehoods first it be false that god make that grant to adam as soon as he be create since though it stand in the text immediately after his creation yet it be plain it could not be speak to adam till after eve be make and bring to him and how then could he be monarch by appointment as soon as create especially since he call if i mistake not that which god say to eve gen iii the original grant of government which not be till after the fall when adam be somewhat at least in time and very much distant in condition from his creation i can not see how our a can say in this sense that by gods appointment as soon as adam be create he be monarch of the world secondly be it true that gods actual donation appoint adam monarch of the world as soon as he be create yet the reason here give for it would not prove it but it would always be a false inference that god by a positive donation appoint adam monarch of the world because by right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity for have give him the right of government by nature there be no need of a positive donation at least it will never be a proof of such a donation on the other side the matter will not be much mend if we understand by gods appointment the law of nature though it be a pretty harsh expression for it in this place and by monarch of the world sovereign ruler of mankind for then the sentence under consideration must run thus by the law of nature as soon as adam be create he be governor of mankind for by right of nature it divas due to adam to be governor of his posterity which amount to this he be governor by right of nature because he be governor by right of nature but suppose we should grant that a man be by nature governor of his children adam could not hereby be monarch as soon as create for this right of nature be found in his be their father how adam could have a natural right to be governor before he be a father men by be a father only he have that right be methinks hard to conceive unless he would have him to be a father before he be a father and have a title before he have it to this foresee objection our a answer very logically he be governor in habit and not in act a very pretty way of be a governor without government a father without children and a king without subject and thus sir robert be an author before he writ his book not in act it be true but in habit for when he have once publish it it be due to him by the right of nature to be an author as much as it be to adam to be governor of his children when he have beget them and if to be such a monarch of the world an absolute monarch in habit but not in act will serve the turn i should not much envy it to any of sir roberts friends that he think fit graciously to bestow it upon though even this of act and habit if it signify any thing but our as skill in distinctions be not to his purpose in this place for the question be not here about adams actual exercise of government but actually have a title to be governor government say our a be due to adam by the right of nature what be this right of nature a right father have over their children by beget them generatione jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos say our a out of grotius de j b p l c s the right then follow the beget as arise from it so that accord to this way of reason or distinguish of our a adam as soon as he be create have a title only in habit and not in act which in plain english be he have actually no title at all to speak less learnedly and more intelligibly one may say of adam he be in a possibility of be governor since it be possible he might beget children lay thereby acquire that right of nature be it what it will to govern them that accrue from thence but what connexion have this with adams creation to make him say that as soon as he be create he be monarch of the world for it may as well be say of noah that as soon as he be bear he be monarch of the world since he be in possibility which in our as sense be enough to make a monarch a monarch in habit to outlive all mankind but his own posterity what such necessary connexion there be betwixt adams creation and his right to government so that a natural freedom of mankind can not be suppose without the denial of the creation of adam i confess for my part i do not see nor how those word by the appointment c obs however explain can be put together to make any tolerable sense at least to establish this position with which they end viz adam be a king from his creation a king say our author not in act but in habit ie actually no king at all i fear i have tire my readers patience by dwell longer on this passage than the weightiness of any argument in it seem to require but i have unavoidably be engage in it by our author way of write who huddle several suppositions together and that in doubtful and general term make such a medley and confusion that it be impossible to show his mistake without examine the several sense wherein his word may be take and without see how in any of these various mean they will consist together and have any truth in then for in this present passage before us how can any one argue against this position of his that adam be a king from his creation unless one examine whether the word from his creation be to be take as they may for the time of the commencement of his government as the fore go word import as soon as he be create he be monarch or for the cause of it as he say p creation make man prince of his posterity how farther can one judge of the truth of his be thus king till one have examine whether king be to be take as the word in the begin of this passage would persuade on supposition of his private dominion which be lay gods positive grant monarch of the world by appointment or king on supposition of lie fatherly power over his offspring which be by nature due by the right of nature whether i say king be to be take in both or one only of these two sense or in neither of then but only this that creation make him prince in a way different from both the other for though this assertion that adam be king from his creation be true in no sense yet it stand here as an evident conclusion draw from the precede word though in truth it be but a bare assertion join to other assertions of the same kind which confidently put together in word of undetermined and dubious mean look like a sort of argue when there be indeed neither proof nor connexion a way very familiar with our author of which have give the reader a taste here i shall as much as the argument will permit me avoid touch on hereafter and should not have do it here be it not to let the world see how incoherences in matter and suppositions without proof put handsomely together in good word and a plausible style be apt to pass for strong reason and good sense till they come to be look into with attention of adams title to sovereignty by donation gen i have at last get through the forego passage where we have be so long detain not by the force of arguments and opposition but by the intricacy of the word and the doubtfulness of the mean let us go on to his next argument for adams sovereignty our author tell us in the word of mr selden that adam by donation from god gen i be make the general lord of all things not without such a private dominion to himself as without his grant do exclude his children this determination of mr selden say our author be consonant to the history of the bible and natural reason obs and in his pref to his observations on aristotle he say thus the first government in the world be monarchical in the father of all flesh adam be command to multiply and people the earth and to subdue it and have dominion give him over all creatures be thereby the monarch of the whole world none of his posterity have any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him the earth saith the psalmist hath he give to the children of men which show the title come from fatherhood before i examine this argument and the text on which it be found it be necessary to desire the reader to observe that our author accord to his usual method begin in one sense and conclude in another he begin here with adams propriety or private dominion by donation and his conclusion be which show the title come from fatherhood but let us see the argument the word of the text be these and god bless them and god say unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every live thing that moveth upon the earth gen i from whence our author conclude that adam have here dominion give him over all creatures be thereby the monarch of the whole world whereby must be mean that either this grant of god give adam property or as our author call it private dominion over the earth and all inferior or irrational creatures and so consequently that he be thereby monarch or dly that it give him rule and dominion over all earthly creatures whatsoever and thereby over his children and so he be monarch for as mr selden have properly word it adam be make general lord of all things one may very clearly understand him that he mean nothing to be grant to adam here but property and therefore he say not one word of adams monarchy but our author say adam be hereby monarch of the world which properly speak signify sovereign ruler of all the men in the world and so adam by this grant must be constitute such a ruler if our author mean otherwise he might with much clearness have say that adam be hereby proprietor of the whole world but he beg your pardon in that point clear distinct speak not serve every where to his purpose you must not expect it in him as in mr selden or other such writers in opposition therefore to our author doctrine that adam be monarch of the whole world found on this place i shall show that by this grant gen i god give no immediate power to adam over men over his children over those of his own species and so he be not make ruler or monarch by this charter that by this grant god give him not private dominion over the inferior creatures but right in common with all mankind so neither be he monarch upon the account of the property here give him that this donation gen i give adam no power over men will appear if we consider the word of it for since all positive grant convey no more than the express word they be make in will carry let us see which of them here will comprehend mankind or adams posterity and those i imagine if any must be these every live thing that moveth the word in hebrew be h ie bestiam reptantem of which word the scripture itself be the best interpreter god have create the fish and fowl the th day the begin of the th he create the irrational inhabitants of the dry land which ver be describe in these word let the earth bring forth the live creature after his kind cattle and creep thin and beasts of the earth after his kind and ver and god make the beasts of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth on the earth after his kind here in the creation of the brute inhabitants of the earth he first speak of them all under one general name of live creatures and then afterwards divide them into three rank cattle or such creatures as be or might be tame and so be the private possession of particular men g which ver in our bible be translate beasts and by the septuagint qhr a wild beasts and be the same word that here in our text ver where we have this great charter to adam be translate live thing and be also the same word use gen ix where this grant be renew to noah and there likewise translate beast the third rank be the creep animals which ver be comprise under the word the same that be use here ver and be translate move but in the former verse creep and by the septuagint in all these place pet or reptiles from whence it appear that the word which we translate here in gods donation ver live creatures move be the same which in the history of the creation ver signify two rank of terrestrial creatures viz wild beasts and reptiles and be so understand by the septuagint when god have make the irrational animals of the world divide into three kinds from the place of their habitation viz fish of the sea fowl of the air and live creatures of the earth and these again into cattle wild beasts and reptiles he consider of make man and the dominion he should have over the terrestrial world ver and then he reckon up the inhabitants of these three kingdoms but in the terrestrial leave out the second rank h or wild beasts but here ver where he actually exercise this design and give him this dominion the text mention the fish of the sea and fowl of the air and the terrestrial creatures in the word that signify the wild beasts and reptiles though translate live thing that moveth leave out cattle in both which place though the word that signify wild beasts be omit in one and that which signify cattle in the other yet since god certainly execute in one lilacs what he declare he design in the other we can not but understand the same in both place and have here only an account how the terrestrial irrational animals which be already create and reckon up at their creation in three distinct rank of cattle wild beasts and reptiles be here ver actually put under the dominion of man as they be design ver nor do these word contain in them the least appearance of any thing that can be wrest to signify gods give to one man dominion over another to adam over his posterity and this further appear front gen ix where god renew this charter to noah and his sons he give them dominion over the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and the terrestrial creatures express by h wild beasts and reptiles the same word that in the text before us gen i be translate every move thing that moveth on the earth which by no mean can comprehend man the grant be make to noah and his sons all the men then live and not to one part of men over another which be yet more evident from the very next word ver where god give every every move thing the very word use ch i to them for food by all which it be plain that gods donation to adam ch i and his designation ver and his grant again to noah and his sons refer to and contain in them neither more nor less than the work of the creation the fifth day and the begin of the sixth as they be set down from the both to th ver inclusively of the st ch and so comprehend all the species of irrational animals of the terraqueous globe though all the word whereby they be express in the history of their creation be nowhere use in any of the follow grant but some of them omit in one and some in another from whence i think it be past all doubt that man can not be comprehend in this grant nor any dominion over those of his own species be convey to adam all the terrestrial irrational creatures be enumerate at their creation ver under the name beasts of the earth cattle and creep things but man be not then create be not contain under any of those name and therefore whether we understand the hebrew word right or no they can not be suppose to comprehend man in the very same history and the very next verse follow especially since that hebrew word which if any in this donation to adam ch i must comprehend man be so plainly use in contradistinction to him as gen vi vii gen viii and if god make all mankind slave to adam and his heirs by give adam dominion over every live thing that moveth on the earth ch i as our author would have it methinks sir robert should leave carry his monarchical power one step higher and satisfy the world that princes might eat their subject too since god give as full power to noah and his heirs ch ix to eat every live thing that moveth as he do to adam to have dominion over them the hebrew word in both place be the same david who might be suppose to understand the donation of god in this text and the right of kings too as well as our author in his comment on this place as the learn and judicious ainsworth call it in the th psalm find here no such charter of monarchical power his word be thou hast make him ie man the son of man a little lower than the angels thou madest him to have dominion over the work of thy hand thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen and the beasts of the field and fowl of the air and fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea in which word if any one can find out that there be mean any monarchical power of one man over another but only the dominion of the whole species of mankind over the inferior species of creatures he may for aught i know deserve to be one of sir roberts monarchs in habit for the rareness of the discovery and by this time i hope it be evident that he that give dominion over every hying thing that moveth on the earth give adam no monarchical power over those of his own species which will yet appear more fully in the next thing i be to show whatever god give by the word of this grant gen i it be not to adam in particular exclusive of all other men whatever dominion he have thereby it be not a private dominion but a dominion in common with the rest of mankind that this donation be not make in particular to adam appear evidently from the word of the text it be make to more than one for it be speak in the plural number god bless them and say unto them have dominion god say unto adam and eve have dominion thereby say our author adam be monarch of the world but the grant be to them ie speak to eve also as many interpreters think with reason that these word be not speak till adam have his wife must not she thereby be lady as well as he lord of the world if it be say that eve be subject to adam it seem she be not so subject to him as to hinder her dominion over the creatures or property in them for shall we say that god ever make a joint grant to two and one only be to have the benefit of it but perhaps it will be say eve be not make till afterward grant it so what advantage will our author get by it the text will be only the more directly against him and show that god in this donation give the world to mankind in common and not to adam in particular the word them in the text must include the species of man for it be certain them can by no mean signify adam alone in the th verse where god declare his intention to give this dominion it be plain he mean that he would make a species of creatures that should have dominion over the other species of this terrestrial globe the word be and god say let us make man in our image after our liken and let them have dominion over the fish c they then be to have dominion who even those who be to have the image of god the individuals of that species of man that he be go to make for that them should signify adam singly of the rest that should be in the world with him be against both scripture and all reason and it can not possibly be make sense if man in the former part of the verse do not signify the same with them in the latter only man there as be usual be take for the species and them the individuals of that species and we leave a reason in the very text god make him in his own image after his own liken make him an intellectual creature and so capable of dominion for wherein soever else the image of god consist the intellectual nature be certainly a part of it and belong to the whole species and enable them to have dominion over the inferior creatures and therefore david say in the th psalm above cite thou hast make him little longer than the angels thou hast make him to have dominion it be not of adam king david speak here for verse it be plain it be of man and the son of man of the species of mankind and that this grant speak to adam be make to him and the whole species of man be clear from our author own proof out of the psalmist the earth saith the psalmist hath he give to the children of men which show the title come from fatherhood these be sir roberts word in the preface before cite and a strange inference it be he make god hath give the earth to the children of men ergo the title come from fatherhood it be pity the propriety of the hebrew tongue have not use father of men instead of children of men to express mankind then indeed our author might have have the countenance of talc socials of the word to have place the title in the fatherhood but to conclude that the fatherhood lead the right to the earth because god give it to the children of men be a way of argue peculiar to our author and a man must have a great mind to go contrary to the sound as well as sense of the word before he could light on it but the sense be yet harder and more remote from our author purpose for as it stand in his preface it be to prove adams be monarch and his reason be thus god give the partly to the children of men ergo adam be monarch of the world i defy any man try make a more pleasant conclusion than this which can not be excuse from the most obvious absurdity till it can be show that by children of men he who have no father adam alone be signify but whatever our author do the scripture speak not nonsense to maintain this property and private dominion of adam our author labour in the follow page to destroy the community grant to noah and his sons in that parallel place gen ix and he endeavour to do it two ways sir robert would persuade us against the express word of the scripture that what be here grant to noah be not grant to his sons in common with him his word be as for the general community between noah and his sons which mr selden will have to be grant to them gen ix the text cloth not warrant it what warrant our author would have when the plain express word of scripture not capable of another mean will not satisfy him who pretend to build wholly on scripture be not easy to imagine the text say god bless noah and his sons and say unto them ie as our author would have it unto him for saith he although the sons be there unmentioned with noah in the bless yet it may best be understand with a subordination or benediction m succession o that indeed be best for our author to be understand which best serve to his purpose but that truly may best be understand by any body else which best agree with the plain construction of the word and arise from the obvious mean of the place and then with subordination and in succession will not be lest understand in a grant of god where he himself put them not nor mention any such limitation but yet our author have reason why it may best he understand so the bless say he in the follow word might truly be fulfil if the sons either under or after their father enjoy a private dominion o that be to say that a grant whose express word give a joint title in present for the text say into your hand they be deliver may best be understand with a subordination or in succession because it be possible that in subordination in succession it may be enjoy which be all one as to say that a grant of any thing in present possession may best be understand of reversion because it be possible one may live to enjoy it in reversion if the grant be indeed to a father and to his sons after him who be so kind as to let his children enjoy it presently in common with him one may truly say as to the event one will be as good as the other but it can never be true that what the express word grant in possession and in common may best be understand to be in reversion the sum of all his reason amount to this god do not give to the sons of noah the world in common with their father because it be possible they might enjoy it under or after him a very good sort of argument against an express text of scripture but god must not be believe though he speak it himself when he say he do any thing which will not consist with sir roberts hypothesis for it be plain however he would exclude them that part of this benediction as he would have it in succession must need be mean to the sons and not to noah himself at all be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth say god in this bless this part of the benedic tion as appear by the sequel concern not noah himself at all for we read not of any children he have after the flood and in the follow chapter where his posterity be reckon up there be no mention of any and so this benediction in succession be not to take place till years after and to save our author imaginary monarchy the people of the world must be defer years for this part of the benediction can not be understand with subordination unless our author will say that they must ask leave of their father noah to lie with their wive but in this one point our author be constant to himself in all his discourse he take care there should be monarchs in the world but very little that there should be people and indeed his way of government be not the way to people the world for how much absolute monarchy help to fulfil this great and primary bless of god almighty be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth which contain in it the improvement too of arts and sciences and the conveniencies of life may be see in those large and rich countries which be happy under the turkish government where be not now to be find onethird nay in many if not most part of them onethirtieth perhaps i might say not onehundredth of the people that be formerly as will easily appear to any one who will compare the account we have of it at this time with ancient history but this by the by the other part of this benediction or grant be so express that they must need be understand to belong equally to them all as much to noahs sons as to noah himself and not to his sons with a subordination or in succession the fear of you and the dread of you say god shall be upon every beast c will any body but our author say that the creatures fear and stand in awe of noah only and not of his sons without his leave or till after his death and the follow word into your hand they be deliver be they to be understand as our author say if your father please or they shall be deliver into your hand hereafter if this be to argue from scripture i know not what may not be prove by it and i can scarce see how much this dither from that fiction and fancy or how much a surer foundation it will prove than the opinions of philosophers and poets which our author so much condemn in his preface but our author go on to prove that it may best be understand with a subordination or a benediction in succession for say he it be not probable that the private dominion which god give to adam and by his donation assignation or cession to his children be abro gate and a community of all things institute between noah and his sonsnoah be leave the sole heir of the world why should it be think that god would disinherit him of his birth right and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children o the prejudice of our own illgrounded opinions however by us call probable can not authorize us to understand scripture contrary to the direct and plain mean of the word i grant it be not probable that adams private dominion be here abrogate because it be more than improbable for it will never be prove that adam have any such private dominion and since parallel place of scripture be most probable to make us know how they may be best understand there need but the compare this bless here to noah and his sons after the flood with that to adam after the creation gen i to assure any one that god give adam no such private dominion it be probable i confess that noah should have the same title the same property and dominion after the flood that adam have before it but since private dominion can not consist with the bless and grant god give to him and his sons in common it be a sufficient reason to conclude that adam have none especially since in the donation make to him there be no word that express it or do in the least favour it and then let my reader judge whether it may best be understand when in the one place there be not one word for it not to say what have be above prove that the test itself prove the contrary and in the other the word and sense be directly against it but our author say noah be the sole heir of the world why should it be think that god would disinherit him of his birth right heir indeed in england signify the eldest son who be by the law of england to have all his father land but where god ever appoint any such heir of the world our author would have do well to have show us and how god disinherit him of his birth right or what harm be do him if god give his sons a right to make use of a part of the earth for support of themselves and families when the whole be not only more than noah himself but infinitely more than they all could make use of and the possessions of one could not at all prejudice or as to any use straiten that of the other our author probably foresee he might not be very successful in persuade people out of their sense and say what he could men would be apt to believe the plain word of scripture and think as they say that the grant be speak to noah and his sons jointly he endeavour to insinuate as if this grant to noah convey no property no dominion because subdue the earth and dominion over the creatures be therein omit nor the earth once name and therefore say he there be a considerable difference between these two texts the first bless give adam a dominion over the earth and all creatures the latter allow noah liberty to use the live creatures for food here be no alteration or diminish of his title to a property of all things but an enlargement only of his commons o so that in our author sense all that be say here to noah and his sons give them no dominion no property but only enlarge the commons their commons i should say since god say to you be they give though our author say his for as to noahs sons they it seem by sir roberts appointment during their father lifetime be to keep fastingdays any one but our author would be mightily suspect to be blind with prejudice that in all this bless to noah and his sons could see nothing but only an enlargement of commons for as to dominion which our author think omit the fear of you and the dread of you say god shall be upon every beast which i suppose express the dominion or superiority be design man over the live creatures as fully as may be for in that fear and dread seem chiefly to consist what be give to adam over the inferior animals who as absolute a monarch as he be could not make bold with a lark or rabbit to satisfy his hunger and have the herbs but in common with the beset as be plain from gen i and in the next place it be manifest that in this bless to noah and his sons property be not only give in clear word but in a larger extent than it be to adam into your hand they be give say god to noah and his sons which word if they give not property nay property in possession it will be hard to find word that can since there be not a way to express a man be possess of any thing more natural nor more certain than to say it be deliver into his hand and ver to show that they have then give them the utmost property man be capable of which be to have a right to destroy any thing by use it every move thing that liveth saith god shall be meat for you which be not allow to adam in his charter this our author call a liberty of use them for food and also an enlargement of commons but no alteration of property o what other property man can have in the creatures but the liberty of use them be hard to be understand so that if the first bless as our author say give adam dominion over the creatures and the bless to noah and his sons give them such a liberty to use them as adam have not it must need give them something that adam with all his sovereignty want something that one would be apt to take for a greater property for certainly he have no absolute dominion over even the brutal part of the creatures and the property he have in them be very narrow and scanty who can not make that use of them which be permit to another should any one who be absolute lord of a country have bid our author subdue the earth and give him dominion over the creatures in it but not have permit him to have take a kid or a lamb out of the flock to satisfy his hunger i guess he would scarce leave think himself lord or proprietor of that land or the cattle on it but would have find the difference between have dominion which a shepherd may have and have full property as an owner so that have it be his own case sir robert i believe would have think here be an alteration nay an enlarge of property and that noah and his children have by this grant not only property give them but such a property give them in the creatures as adam have not for however in respect of one another slice may lo allow to have propriety in their distinct portion of the creatures yet in respect of god the maker of heaven and earth who be sole lord and proprietor of the whole world man propriety in the creatures be nothing but that liberty to use them which god have permit and so man property may be alter and enlarge as we see it here after the flood when other use of them be allow which before be not from all which i suppose it be clear that neither adam nor noah have any private dominion any property in the creatures exclusive of his posterity as they should successively grow up into need of them and come to be able to make use of them thus we have examine our author argument for adams monarchy found on the bless pronounce gen i wherein i think it be impossible for any sober reader to find any other but the set of mankind above the other kinds of creatures in this habitable earth of ours it be nothing but the give to man the whole species of man as the chief inhabitant who be the image of his maker the dominion over the other creatures this lie so obvious in the plain word that any one but our author would have think it necessary to have show how these word that seem to say the quite contrary give adam monarchical absolute power over other men or the sole property in all the creatures and methinks in a business of this moment and that whereon he build all that follow he should have do something more than barely cite word which apparently make against him for i confess i can not see any thing in them tend to adams monarchy or private dominion but quite the contrary and i the less deplore the dulness of my apprehension herein since i find the apostle seem to have as little notion of any such private dominion of adam as i when he say god give us all things richly to enjoy which he could not do if it be all give away already to monarch adam and the monarchs his heirs and successors to conclude this text be so far from prove adam sole proprietor that on the contrary it be a confirmation of the original community of all things amongst the sons of men which appear from this donation of god as well as other place of scripture the sovereignty of adam build upon his private dominion must fall not hay any foundation to support it but yet if after all any one will need have it so that by this donation of god adam be make sole proprietor of the whole earth what will this be to his sovereignty and how will it appear that propriety in land give a man power over the life of another or how will the possession even of the whole earth give any one a sovereign arbitrary authority over the persons of men the most specious thing to be say be that he that be proprietor of the whole world may deny all the rest of mankind food and so at his pleasure starve them if they will not acknowledge his sovereignty and obey his will if this be true it would be a good argument to prove that there never be any such property that god never give any such private dominion since it be more reasonable to think that god who bid mankind increase and multiply should rather himself give them all a right to make use of the food and raiment and other conveniencies of life the materials whereof he have so plentifully provide for them than to make them depend upon the will of a man for their subsistence who should have power to destroy them all when he please and who be no better than other men be in succession likelier by want and the dependence of a scanty fortune to tie them to hard service than by liberal allowance of the conveniencies of life to promote the great design of god increase and multiply he that doubt this let him look into the absolute monarchies of the world and see what become of the conveniencies of life and the multitudes of people but we know god hath not leave one man so to the mercy of another that he may starve him if he please god the lord and father of all have give no one of his children such a property in his peculiar portion of the things of this world but that he have give his needy brother a right to the surplusage of his goods so that it can not justly be deny him when his press want call for it and therefore no man could ever have a just power over the life of another by right of property in land or possessions since it would always be a sin in any man of estate to let his brother perish for want of afford him relief out of his plenty as justice give every man a title to the product of his honest industry and the fair acquisitions of his ancestors descend to him so charity give every man a title to so much out of anothers plenty as will keep him from extreme want where he have no mean to subsist otherwise and a man can no mare justly make use of anothers necessity to force him to become his vassal by withhold that relief god require him to afford to the want of his brother than he that have more strength can seize upon a weaker master him to his obedience and with a dagger at his throat offer him death or slavery should any one make so perverse an use of gods bless pour on him with a liberal hand should any one be cruel and uncharitable to that extremity yet all this would not prove that propriety ill land even in this case give any authority over the persons of men but only that compact might since the authority of the rich proprietor and the subjections of the needy beggar begin not from the possession of the lord but the consent of the poor man who prefer be his subject to starve and the man he thus submit to can pretend to no more power over him than he have consent to upon compact upon this grind a man have his store fill in a time of scarcity have money in his pocket be in a vessel at sea be able to swim c may as well be the foundation of rule and dominion as be possessor of all the land in the world any of these be sufficient to enable me to save a man life who would perish if such assistance be deny him and any thing by this rule that may be an occasion of work upon anothers necessity to sale his life or any thing dear to him at the of his freedom may be make a foundation of sovereignty as well as property from all which it be clear that though god should have give adam private dominion yet that private dominion could give him no sovereignty but we have already sufficiently prove that god give him no private dominion of adams title to sovereignty by the subjection of eve the next place of scripture we find our author build his monarchy of adam on be gen iii and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee here we have say he the original grant of government from whence he conclude in the follow part of the page o that the supreme power be settle in the fatherhood and limit to one kind of government that be to monarchy for let his premise be what they will this be always the conclusion let rule in any text be but once name and presently absolute monarchy be by divine right establish if any one will but carefully read our author own reason from these word o and consider among other things the line and posterity of adam as he there bring them in he will find some difficulty to make sense of what he say but we will allow this at present to his peculiar way of write and consider the force of the text in hand the word be the curse of god upon the woman for have be the first and forwardest in the disobedience and if we will consider the occasion of what god say here to our first parent that he be denounce judgment and declare his wrath against them both for their disobedience we can not suppose that this be the time wherein god be grant adam prerogatives and privilege invest him with dignity and authority elevate him to dominion and monarchy for though as a holster in the temptation live be lay below him and so he have accidentally a superiority over her for her greater punishment yet he too have his share in the fall as well as the sin and be lay lower as may be see in the follow verse and it would be hard to imagine that gall in the same breath should make him universal monarch over all mankind and a daylabourer for his life turn lie out of paradise to till the grind ver and at the same time advance him to a throne and all the privilege and case of absolute power this be not a time when adam could expect any favour any grant of privilege from his offend maker if this be the original grant of government as our author tell us and adam be now make monarch whatever sir robert would have him it be plain god make him but a very poor monarch such an one as our author himself would have count it no great privilege to be god set him to work for his live and seem rather to give him a spade into his hand to subdue the earth than a sceptre to rule over its inhabitants in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread say god to him ver this be unavoidable may it perhaps be answer because he be yet without subject and have nobody to work for him but afterwards live as he do above years he might have people enough whom he might command to work for him no say god not only whilst thou art without other help save thy wife but as long as thou livest shalt thou live by thy labour in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread till thou return unto the grind for out of it west thou take for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return ver it will perhaps be answer again in favour of our author that these word be not speak personally to adam but in him as their representative to all mankind this be a curse upon mankind because of the fall god i believe speak differently from men because he speak with more truth more certainty but when he vouchsafe to speak to men l do not think he speak differently from them in cross the rule of language in use amongst them this would not be to condescend to their capacities when he humble himself to speak to them but to lose his design in speak what thus speak they could not understand and fact thus must we think of god if the interpretations of scripture necessary to maintain our author doctrine must be receive for good for by the ordinary rule of language it will be very hard to understand what god say if what he speckle here in the singular number to adam must be understand to be speak to all mankind and what he say in the plural number gen i and must be understand of adam alone exclusive of all others and what he say to noah and his sons jointly must be understand to be mean to noah alone gen ix farther it be to be note that these word here of gen iii which our author call the original grant of government be not speak to adam neither indeed be there any grant in them snide to adam but a punishment lay upon eve and if we will take them as they be direct in particular to her or in her as their representative to all other women they will at most concern the female sex only and im port no more but that subjection they should ordinarily be in to their husband but there be here no more law to oblige a woman to such subjection if the circumstances either of her condition or contract with her husband should exempt her from it than there be that she should bring forth her children in sorrow and pain if there could be find a remedy for itwhich be also a part of the same curse upon her for the whole verse run thus unto the woman he say i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee it would i think have be a hard matter for any body but our author to have find out a grant of monarchical government to adam in these word which be neither speak to nor of him neither will any one i suppose by these word think the weaker sex as by a law so subject to the curse contain in them that it be their duty not to endeavour to avoid it find will any one say that eve or any other woman sin if she be bring to bed without those multiply pain god threaten her here with or that either of our queen mary or elizabeth have they marry any of their subject have be by this text put into a political subjection to him or that he should thereby have have monarchical rule over her god in this text give note that i see any authority to adam over eve or to men over their wive but only foretell what should be the womans lot how by his providence he would order it so that she should be subject to her husband as we see that generally the laws of mankind and customs of nations leave order it so and there be i grant a foundation in nature for it thus when god say of jacob and esau that the elder should serve the younger gen xxv nobody suppose that god hereby make jacob esaus sovereign but foretell what should de facto come to pass but if these word here speak to eve must need be understand as a law to bind her and all other women to subjection it can be no other subjection than what every wife owe her husband and then if this be the original grant of government and the foundation of monarchical power there will be as many monarchs as there be husband if therefore these word give any power to adam it can be only a conjugal power not political the power that every husband hath to order the things of private concernment in his family as proprietor of the goods and land there and to have his will take place before that of his wife in all things of their common concernment but not a political power of life and death over her much less over any body else this i be sure if our author will have this text to be a grant the original grant of government political government he ought to have prove it by some better arguments than by barely say that thy desire shall be unto thy husband be a law whereby eve and all that should come of her be subject to the absolute monarchical power of adam and his heirs thy desire shall be to thy husband be too doubtful an expression of whose signification interpreters be not agree to build so confidently on and in a matter of such moment and so great and general concernment but our author accord to his way of write have once name the text conclude presently without any more ado that the mean be as he would have it let the word rule and subject be but find in the text or margin and it immediately signify the duty of a subject to his prince the relation be change and though god say husband sir robert will have it king adam have presently absolute monarchical power over eve and not only over love but all that should come of her though the scripture say not a word of it nor our author a word to prove it but adam must for all that be an absolute monarch and so down to the end of the chapter and here i leave my reader to consider whether my bare say without offer any reason to evince it that this text give not adam that absolute monarchical power our author suppose be not as sufficient to destroy that power as his bare assertion be to establish it since the text mention neither prince nor people speckle nothing of absolute or monarchical power but the subjection of eve to adam a wife to her husband and he that would trace our author so all through would make a short and sufficient answer to the greatest part of the ground he proceed on and abundantly confute them by barely deny it be a sufficient answer to assertions without proof to deny them without give a reason and therefore should i have say nothing but barely deny that by this text the supreme power be settle and found by god himself in the fatherhood limit to monarchy and that to adams person and heirs all which our author notably conclude from these word as may be see in the same page o it have be a sufficient answer should i have desire any sober man only to have read the text and consider to whom and on what occasion it be speak he would no doubt have wonder how our author find out monarchical absolute power in it have he not have an exceed good faculty to find it himself where he could not show it others and thus we have examine the two place of scripture all that i remember our author bring to prove adams sovereignty that supremacy which he say it be gods ordinance should be unlimited in adam and as large as all the act of his will o viz gen i and gen iii one whereof signify only the subjection of the inferior rank of creatures to mankind and the other the subjection that be due from a wife to her husband both far enough from that which subject owe the governors of political societies i of adams title to sovereignty by fatherhood there be one thing more and then i think i have give you all that our author bring for proof of adams sovereignty and that be a supposition of a natural right of dominion over his children by be their father and this title of fatherhood he be so please with that you will find it bring in almost in every page particularly he say not only adam but the succeed patriarchs have by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children p and in the same page this subjection of children be the fountain of all regal authority c this be as one would think by his so frequent mention it the main basis of all his frame we may well expect clear and evident reason for it since he lay it down as a position necessary to his purpose that every man that be bear be so far from be free that by his very birth he become a subject of him that beget him o so that adam be the only man create and all ever since be beget nobody have be bear free if we ask how adam come by this power over his children he tell us here it be lay beget them and so again o this natural dominion of adam say he may be prove out of grotius himself who teacheth that generations jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos and indeed the act of beget be that which make a man a father his right of a father over his children can naturally arise from nothing else grotius tell us lot here how far this jus in liberos this power of parent over their children extend but our author always very clear in the point assure us it be supreme power and like that of absolute monarchs over their slave absolute power of life and death he that should demand of him how or for what reason it be that beget a child give the father such an absolute power over him will find him answer nothing we be to take his word for this as well as several other things and by that the laws of nature and the constitutions of government must stand or fall have he be an absolute monarch this way of talk might have suit well enough pro ratione voluntas might have be of force in his mouth but in the way of proof or argument be very unbecoming and will little advantage his plea for absolute monarchy sir robert have too much lessen a subject authority to leave himself the hop of establish any thing by his bare say it one slave opinion without proof be not of weight enough to dispose of the liberty and fortunes of all mankind if all men be not as i think they be naturally equal i be sure all slave be and then i may without presumption oppose my single opinion to his and be confident that my say that beget of children make them not slave to their father as certainly set all mankind free as his affirm the contrary make them all slave but that this position which be the foundation of all their doctrine who would have monarchy to be jure divino may have all fair play let us hear what reason others give for it since our author offer none the argument i leave hear others make use of to prove that father by beget them come by an absolute power over their children be this that father have a power over the live of their children because they give them life and be which be the only proof it be capable of since there can be no reason why naturally one man should have any claim or presence of right over that in another which be never his which he bestow not but be receive from the bounty of another i answer that every one who give another any thing have not always thereby a right to take it away again but they who say the father give life to children be so dazzle with the thoughts of monarchy that they do not as they ought remember god who be the author and giver of life it be in him alone we live move and have our be how can he be think to give life to another that know not wherein his own life consist philosophers be at a loss about it after their most diligent inquiries and anatomists after their whole live and study spend in dissections and diligent examine the body of men confess their ignorance in the structure and use of many part of man body and in that operation wherein life consist in the whole and doth the rude ploughman or the more ignorant voluptuary frame or fashion such an admirable engine as this be and then put life and sense into it can any man say he form the part that be necessary to the life of his child or can he suppose himself to give the life and yet not know what subject be fit to receive it nor what action or organs be necessary for its reception or preservation to give life to that which have yet no be be to frame and make a live creature fashion the part and mould and suit them to their use and have proportion and fit them together to put into them a hying soul he that could do this might indeed have some presence to destroy his own workmanship but be there any one so bold that dare thus far arrogate to himself the incomprehensible work of the almighty who alone do at first and continue still to make a live soul he alone can breathe in the greatly of life if any one think himself an artist at this let lie number up the part of his childs body will he hath make tell me their use and operations and when the live and rational soul begin to inhabit this curious structure when sense begin and how this engine which he have frame think and reason if he make it let him when it be out of order mend it at least tell wherein the defect lie shall he that make the eye not see say the psalmist psalm xciv see these mens vanities the structure of that one part be sufficient to convince us of an allwise contriver and he have so visible a claim to us as his workmanship that one of the ordinary appellations of god in scripture be god our maker and the lord our maker and therefore though our author for the magnify his fatherhood be please to say o that even the power which god himself exerciseth over mankind be by right of fatherhood yet this fatherhood be such an one as utterly exclude all presence of title in earthly parent for he be king because he be indeed maker of us all which no parent can pretend to be of their children but have men skill and power to make their children it be not so slight a piece of workmanship that it can be imagine they could make them without design it what father of a thousand when he beget a child think farther than the satisfy his prey send appetite god in his infinite wisdom have put strong desire of copulation into the constitution of men thereby to continue the race of mankind which he doth most commonly without the intention and often against the consent and will of the begetter and indeed those who desire and design children be but the occasion of their be and when they design and wish to beget them do little more towards their make than deucalion and his wife in the fable do towards the make of mankind by throw pebbles over their head but grant that the parent make their children give them life and be and that hence there follow an absolute power this would give the father but a joint dominion with the mother over them for nobody can deny but that the woman lath an equal share if not the greater as nourish the child a long time in her own body out of her own substance there it be fashion and from her it receive the materials and principles of its constitution and it be so hard to imagine the rational soul should presently inhabit the yet unformed embryo as soon as the father have do his part in the act of generation that if it must be suppose to derive any thing from the parent it must certainly owe most to the mother but be that as it will the mother can not be deny an equal share in beget of the child nod so the absolute authority of the father will not arise from hence our author indeed be of another mind for he say we know that god at the creation give the sovereignty to the man over the woman as be the nobler and principal agent in generation o i remember not this in my bible and when the place be bring where god at the creation give the sovereignty to man over the woman and that for this reason because he be the nobler and principal agent in generation it will be time enough to consider and answer it but it be no new thing for our author to tell us his own fancy for certain and divine truths though there be often a great deal of difference between his and divine revelations for god in the scripture say his father and his mother that beget him they who allege the practice of mankind for expose or sell their children as a proof of their power over them be with sir robert happy arguers and can not but recommend their opinion by found it on the most shameful action and most unnatural murder human nature be capable of the dens of lions and nurseries of wolves know no such cruelty as this these savage inhabitants of the desert obey god and nature in be tender and careful of their offspring they will hunt watch fight and almost starve for the preservation of their young never part with them never forsake them till they be able to shift for themselves and be it the privilege of man alone to act more contrary to nature than the wild and most untamed part of the creation doth god forbid us under the severest penalty that of death to take away the life of any man a stranger and upon provocation and do he permit us to destroy those he have give us the charge and care of and by the dictate of nature and reason as well as his reveal command require us to preserve he have in all the part of creation take a peculiar care to propagate and continue the several species of creatures anal make the individuals act so strongly to this end that they sometimes neglect their own private good for it and seem to forget that general rule which nature teach all things of selfpreservation and the preservation of their young as the strongest principle in them overrule the constitution of their particular natures thus we see when their young stand in need of it the timorous become valiant the fierce and savage kind and the ravenous tender and liberal but if the example of what hath be do be the rule of what ought to be history would have furnish our author with instance of this absolute fatherly power in its height and perfection and he might have show us in peru people that beget children on purpose to fatten and eat them the story be so remarkable that i can not but set it down in the author word in some provinces say he they be so liquorish after man flesh that they would not have the patience to stay till the breath be out of the body but would suck the blood as it run from the wound of the die man they have public shamble of man flesh and their madness herein be to that degree that they spar not their own children which they have beget on strangers take in war for they make their captives their mistresses and choicely nourish the children they lead by them till about thirteen years old they butcher and eat them and they serve the mother after the same fashion when they grow past childbearing and cease to bring them any more roasters garcilasso de la vega hist des yncas de peru i c thus far can the busy mind of man carry him to a brutality below the level of beasts when he quit his reason which place him almost equal to angels nor can it be otherwise in a creature whose thoughts be more than the sand and wider than the ocean where fancy and passion must need run him into strange course if reason which be his only star and compass be not that he steer by the imagination be always restless and suggest variety of thoughts and the will reason be lay afield be ready for every extravagant project and in this state he that go farthest out of the way be think fittest to lead and be sure of most followers and when fashion hath once establish what folly or craft begin custom make it sacred and it will be think impudence or madness to contradict or question it he that will impartially survey the nations of the world will find so much of their religions governments and manners bring in and continue amongst them by these mean that he will have but little reverence for the practice which be in use and credit amongst men and will have reason to think that the woods and forest where the irrational unteach inhabitants keep right by follow nature be fitter to give us rule than cities and palaces where those that call themselves civil and rational go out of their way by the authority of example if precedents be sufficient to establish a rule in this case our author might have find in holy writ children sacrifice by their parent and this amongst the people of god themselves the psalmist tell us psalm cvi they shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrifice unto the idols of canaan but god judge not of this by our author rule nor allow of the authority of practice against his righteous law but as it follow there the land be pollute with blood therefore be the wrath of the lord kindle against his people insomuch that he abhor his own inheritance the kill of their children though it be fashionable be charge on them as innocent blood and so have in the account of god the guilt of murder as the offer them to idols have the guilt of idolatry be it then as sir robert say that anciently it be usual for men to sell and castrate their children o let it be that they expose them add to it if you please for this be still greater power that they beget them for their table to fat and eat them if this prove a right to do so we may by the same argument justify adultery incest and sodomy for there be examples of these too both ancient and modern sin which i suppose have their principal aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriagebed as necessary hereunto in confirmation of this natural authority of the father our author bring a lame proof from the positive command of god in scripture his word be to confirm the natural right of regal power we find in the decalogue that the law which enjoin obedience to kings be deliver in the term honour thy father p whereas many confess that government only in the abstract be the ordinance of god they be not able to prove any such ordinance in the scripture but only in the fatherly power and therefore we find the commandment that enjoin obedience to superiors give in the term honour thy father so that not only the power and right of government but the form of the power govern and the person have the power be all the ordinances of god the first father have not only simply power but power monarchical as he be father immediately from god o to the same purpose the same law be cite lay our author in several other place and just after the same fashion that be and mother as apocryphal word be always leave out a great argument of our author ingenuity and the goodness of his cause which require in its defender zeal to a degree of warmth able to warp the sacred rule of the word of god to make it comply with his present occasion a way of proceed not unusual to those who embrace not truths because reason and revelation offer them but espouse tenets and party for end deferent from truth and then resolve at any rate to defend then and so do with the word and sense of author they would fit to their purpose just as procrustes do with his guests lop or stretch them as clay best fit them to the size of their notions and they always prove like those so serve deform lame and useless for have our author set down this command without garble as god give it and join another to father every reader would have see that it have make directly against him and that it be so far from establish the monarchical power of the father that it set up the mother equal with him and enjoin zing but be due in common to both father and mother for that be the constant tenour of the scripture honour thy father and thy another exod xx he that smiteth his father or mother shall surely be put to death xx he that curseth his father or mother shall surely be put to death ver repeat lev xx and by our saviour matth xv ye shall fear every man his mother and his father lev xix if any man have a rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother then shall his father and his mother lay hold an him and say this our son be stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice deut xxi curse be he that setteth light by his father or his mother xxvii my son hear the instructions of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother be the word of solomon a king who be not ignorant of what belong to him as a father or a king and yet he join father and mother together in all the instructions he give children quite through his book of proverbs woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou bring forth isa xiv in thee have they set light by father and mother ezeli xxii and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that beget him shall say unto him thou shalt not live and his father anti his mother that beget him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth zech xiii here not the father only but the father and mother jointly have power in this case of life and death thus run the law of the old testament and in the new they be likewise join in the obedience of their children eph vi the rule be children obey your parent and do not remember that i any where read children obey your father and no more the scripture join mother too in that homage which be due from children and have there be any text where the honour or obedience of children have be direct to the father alone it be not likely that our author who pretend to build all upon scripture would have omit it nay the scripture make the authority of father and mother in respect of those they have beget so equal that in some place it neglect even the priority of order which be think due to the father and the mother be put first as lev xix a from which so constantly join father and mother together as be find quite through scripture we may conclude that the honour they have a title to from their children be one common right belong so equally to them both that neither can claim it wholly neither can be exclude one would wonder then how our author infer from the fifth commandment that all power be originally in the father how he find monarchical power of government settle and fix by the commandment honour thy father and thy mother if all the honour due by the commandment be it what it will be the only right of the father because he as our author say have the sovereignty over the woman as be the nobler and principal agent in generation why do god afterwards all along join the mother with him to share in his honour can the father by this sovereignty of his discharge the child front pay this honour to his mother the scripture give no such licence to the jews anal yet there be often breach wide enough betwixt husband and wife even to divorce and separation and i think nobody will say a child may withhold honour from his mother or as the scripture term it set light by her though his father should command him to do so no more than the mother could dispense with him for neglect to honour his father whereby it be plain that this command of god give the father no sovereignty no supremacy i agree with our author that the title to this honour be vest in the parent by nature and be a right which accrue to them by their have beget their children and god by many positive declarations have confirm it to them i also allow our author rule that in grant and gift that have their original from god and nature as the power of the father let me add and mother for whom god hath join together let no man put asunder no inferior power of men can limit nor make any law of prescription against them o so that the mother have by this law of god a right to honour from her children which be not subject to the will of her husband we see this absolute monarchical popover of the father can neither be found on it nor consist with it and he have a power very far from monarchical very far from that absoluteness our author contend for when another have over his subject the same power he hath and by the same title and therefore he can not forbear say himself that he can not see how any man children can be free from subjection to their parent p which in common speech i think signify mother as well as father or if parent here signify only father it be the first time i ever yet know it to do so and by such an use of word one may say any thing by our author doctrine the father have absolute jurisdiction over his children have also the same over their issue and the consequence be good be it true that the father have such a power and yet i ask our author whether the grandfather by his sovereignty could discharge the grandchild from pay to his father the honour due to him by the fifth commandment if the grandfather hath by right of fatherhood sole sovereign power in him and that obedience which be due to the supreme magistrate he command in these word honour thy father it be certain the grandfather might dispense with the grandsons honour his father which since it be evident in common sense he can not it follow from hence that honour thy father and mother can not mean an absolute subjection to a sovereign power but something else belie right therefore which parent have by nature and which be confirm to them by the fifth commandment can not be that political dominion which our author would derive from it for that be in every civil society supreme somewhere can discharge any subject from any political obedience to any one of his fellowsubjects but what law of the magistrate can give a child liberty not to honour his father and mother it be an eternal law annex purely to the relation of parent and children and so contain nothing of the magistrates power in it nor be subject to it our author say god hath give to a father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other o i doubt whether he can alien wholly the right of honour that be due from them but be that as it will this i be sure he can not alien and retain the same power if therefore the magistrates sovereignty be as our author would have it nothing but the authority of a supreme father p it be unavoidable that if the magistrate hath all this paternal right as he must have if fatherhood be the fountain of all authority then the subject though father can have no power over their children no right to honour from them for it can not be all in anothers hand and a part remain with the parent so that accord to our author own doctrine honour thy father and mother can not possibly be understand of political subjec tion and obedience since the laws both in the old and new testament that command children to honour and obey their parent be give to such whose father be under civil government and fellowsubjects with them in political societies and to have bid them honour and obey their parent in our author sense have be to bid them be subject to those who have no title to it the right to obedience from subject be all vest in another and instead of teach obedience this have be to foment sedition by set up power that be not if therefore this command honour thy father and mother concern political dominion it directly overthrow our author monarchy since it be to be pay by every child to his father even in society every father must necessarily have political dominion and there will be as many sovereigns as there be father besides that the mother too hath her title which destroy the sovereignty of one supreme monarch but if honour thy father and mother mean something distinct from political power as necessarily it must it be besides our author business and serve nothing to his purpose the law that enjoin obedience to kings be deliver say our author in the term honour thy father as if all power be originally in the father o and that law be also deliver say i in the term honour thy mother as if all power be originally in the mother i appeal whether the argument be not as good on one side as the other father and mother be join all along in the old and new testament wherever honour or obedience be enjoin children again our author tell us o that this command honour thy father give the right to govern anal make the form of government monarchical to which i answer that if by honour thy father be mean obedience to the political power of the magistrate it concern not any duty we owe to our natural father who be subject because they by our author doctrine be divest of all that power it be place wholly in the prince and so be equally subject and slave with their children can have no light by that title to any such honour or obedience be contain in it political subjection if honour thy father and mother signify the duty we owe our natural parent as by our saviours interpretation matth xv and tall the other mention place it be plain it do then it can not concern political obedience but a duty that it owe to persons who have no title to sovereignty nor any political authority as magistrates ever subject for the person of a private father and a title to obedience due ho the supreme magistrate be things inconsistent and therefore this command which must necessarily comprehend the persons of natural father must mean a duty we owe them distinct from our obedience to the magistrate and from which the most absolute poorer of princes can not absolve us what this duty be we shall in its due place examine and thus we have at last get through all that in our author look like an argument for that absolute unlimited sovereignty describe sect which he sup pose in adam so that mankind have ever since be all bear slave without any title to freedom but if creation which give nothing but a be make not adam prince of his posterity if adam gen i be not constitute lord of mankind nor have a private dominion give him exclusive of his children but only a right and power over the earth and inferior creatures in common with the children of men if also gen iii god give not any particular power to adam over his wife and children but only subject eve to adam as a punishment or foretell the subjection of the weaker sex in the order the common concernments of their families but give not thereby to adam as to the husband power of life and death which necessarily bet long to the magistrate if father by beget their children acquire no such power over them and if the command honour thy father and mother give it not but only enjoin a duty owe to parent equally whether subject or not and to the mother as well as the father if all this be so as i think by what have be say be very evident then man have a natural freedom notwithstanding all our author confidently say to the contrary since all that share in the same common nature faculties and power be in nature equal and ought to partake in the same common right and privilege till the manifest appointment of god who be lord over all bless for ever can be produce show any particular persons supremacy or a man own consent subject him to a superior this be so plain that our author confess that sir john hayward blackwood and barclay the great vindicators of the right of kings could not deny it but admit with one consent the natural liberty and equality of mankind for a truth unquestionable and our author hath be so far from produce any thing that may make good his great position that adam be absolute monarch and so men be not naturally free that even his own proof make against him so that to use his own way of argue the first erroneous principle fail the whole fabric of this vast engine of absolute power and tyranny drop down of itself and there need no more to be say in answer to all that he build upon so false and frail a foundation but to save others the pain be there any need he be not spar himself to show by his own contradictions the weakness of his own doctrine adams absolute and sole dominion be that which he be every where full of and all along build on and yet he tell us p that as adam be lord of his children so his children under him have a command and power over their own children the unlimited and undivided sovereignty of adams fatherhood by our author computation stand but a little while only during the first generation but as soon as he have grandchildren sir robert could give but a very ill account of it adam as father of his children saith he hath an absolute unlimited royal power over them and by virtue thereof over those that they beget and so to all generations and yet his children viz cain and seth have a paternal power over their children at the same time so that they be at the same time absolute lordsand yet vassals and slave adam have all the authority as grandfather of the people and they have a part of it as father of a part of them he be absolute over them and their posterity by have beget them and yet they be absolute over their children by the same title no say our author adams children under him have power over their own children but still with subordination to the first parent a good distinction that sound well and it be pity it signify nothing nor can be reconcile with our author word i readily grant that suppose adams absolute power over his posterity any of his children might hare from him a delegate and so a subordinate power over a part or all the rest but that can not be the power our author speak of here it be not a power by grant and commission but the natural paternal power he suppose a father to have over his children for he say as adam be lord of his children so his children under him have a power over their own children they be then lord over their own children after the same manner and by the same title that adam be ie by right of generation by right of fatherhood it be plain he mean the natural power of father because he limit it to be only over their own children a delegate power have no such limitation as only over their own children it might be over others be well as their own children if it be a delegate power it must appear in scripture but there be no grind in scripture to affirm that adams children have any other power over theirs than what they naturally have as father but that he mean here paternal power and no other be past doubt from the inference he make ill these word immediately follow i see not then how the children of adam or of any man else can be free from subjection to their parent whereby it appear that the power on one side and the subjection on the other our author here speak of be that natural power and subjection between parent and children for that which every mens children owe could be no other and that our author always affirm to be absolute and unlimited this natural power of parent over their children adam have over his posterity say our author and this power of parent over their children his children have over theirs in his lifetime say our author also so that adam by a natural right of father have an absolute unlimited power over all his posterity anal at the saline time his children have by the same right absolute unlimited power over theirs here then be two absolute unlimited power exist together which i would love any body reconcile one to another or to common sense for the salvo he have put in of subordination make it more absurd to have one absolute unlimited nay unlimitable power in subordination to another be so manifest a contradiction that nothing can be more adam be absolute prince with the un limit authority of fatherhood over all his posterity all his posterity be then absolutely his subject anal as our author say his slave children and grandchildren be equally in this state of subjection and slavery and yet say our author the children of adam have paternal ie absolute unlimited power over their own children which in plain english be they be slave and absolute princes at the same time and in the same government and one part of the sum jects have an absolute unlimited power over the other by the natural right of parentage if any one will suppose in favour of our author that he here mean that parent who be in subjection themselves to the absolute authority of their father have yet some power over their children i confess he be something nearer the truth but he will not at all hereby help our author for he nowhere speak of the paternal power but as an absolute unlimited authority can not be suppose to understand any thing else here unless he himself have limit it and show how far it reach and that he mean here paternal authority in that large extent be plain from the immediately follow word this subjection of children be say he the foundation of all regal authority p the subjection then that in the former line he say every man be in to his parent and consequently what adams grandchildren be in to their parent be that which be the fountain of all regal authority ie accord to our author absolute unlimitable authority and thus adams children have regal authority over their children whilst they themselves be subject to their father and fellowsubjects with their children but him mean as he please it be plain he allow adams children to have paternal power p as also all other father to have paternal power over their children o from whence one of these two things will necessarily follow that either adams children even in his life time have and so all other father have as he phrase it p by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children or else that adam by right of fatherhood have not royal authority for it can not be lout that paternal power do or do not give royal authority to them that have it if it do not then adam could not be sovereign by this title nor any body else and then there be an end of all our author politics at once if it do give royal authority then every one that have paternal power have royal authority and then by our author patriarchal government there will be as many kings as there be father an i thus what a monarchy he hath set up let him and his disciples consider princes certainly will have great reason to thank him for these new politics which set up as many absolute kings in every country as there be father of children and yet who can blame our author for it it lie unavoidably in the way of one discourse upon our author principles for have place an absolute power in father by right of beget he could not easily resolve how much of this power belong to a son over the children he have beget and so it fell out to be a very hard matter to give all the power as he do to adam and yet allow a part in his life time to his children when they be parent and which he know not well how to deny them this make him so doubtful in his expressions and so uncertain where to place this absolute natural power which he call fatherhood sometimes adam alone have it all as p o and pref sometimes parent have it which word scarce signify the father alone p sometimes children during their father lifetime as p sometimes father of families as p sometimes father indefinitely o sometimes the heir to adam o sometimes the posterity of adam sometimes prime father all sons of grandchildren of noah o sometimes the eldest parent p sometimes all kings p sometimes all that have supreme power o sometimes heirs to those first progenitors who be at first the natural parent of the whole people p sometimes an elective king p sometimes those whether a few or a multitude that govern the commonweath p sometimes he that can catch it an usurper p o thus this new nothing that be to carry with it all power authority and government this fatherhood which be to design the person and establish the throne of monarchs whom the people be to obey may accord to sir robert come into any hand any how and so by his politics give to democracy royal authority and make an usurper a lawful prince and if it will do all these fine feats much good do our author and all his followers with their omnipotent fatherhood which can serve for nothing but to unsettle and destroy all the lawful governments in the world and to establish in their room disorder tyranny and usurpation ii of fatherhood and property consider together as fountains of sovereignty in the forego chapters we have see what adams monarchy be in our author opinion and upon what title he found it the foundations which he lay the chief stress on as those from which he think he may best derive monarchical power to future princes be two viz fatherhood and property and therefore the way he propose to remove the absurdities and inconveniencies of the doctrine of natural freedom be to maintain the natural and private dominion of adam o conformable hereunto he tell us the ground and principles of government necessarily depend upon the original of property o the subjection of children to their parent be the fountain of all regal authority p and all power on earth be either derive or usurp from the fatherly power there be no other original to be find of any power whatsoever o i will not stand here to examine how it can be say without a contradiction that the first ground and principles of government necessarily depend upon the original of property and yet that there be no other original of any power whatsoever but that of the father it be hard to understand how there can be no other original but fatherhood and yet that the ground and principles of government depend upon the original of property property and fatherhood be as far different as lord of a manor and father of children nor do i see how they will either of them agree with what our author say o of gods sentence against eve gen iii that it be the original grant of government so that if that be the original government have not its original by our author own confession either from property or fatherhood and this text which he bring as a proof of adams power over eve necessarily contradict what he say of the fatherhood that it be the sole fountain of all power for if adam have any such regal power over eve as our author contend for it must be by some other title than that of beget but i leave him to reconcile these contradictions as well as many others which may plentifully be find in him by any one who will but read him with a little attention and shall come now to consider how these two originals of government adams natural and private dominion will consist and serve to make out and establish the title of succeed monarchs who as our author oblige them must all derive their popover from these fountains let us then suppose adam make by gods donation lord and sole proprietor of the whole earth in as large and ample a manner as sir robert could wish let us suppose him also by right of fatherhood absolute ruler over his children with an unlimited supremacy i ask then upon adams death what become of both his natural and private domination and i doubt not it will be answer that they descend to his next heir as our author tell us in several place but this way it be plain can not possibly convey both his natural and private dominion to the same person for should we allow that all the property all the estate of the father ought to descend to the eldest son which will need some proof to establish it and so he have by that title all the private dominion of the father yet the father natural dominion the paternal power can not descend to him by inheritance for it be a right that accrue to a man only by beget no man can have this natural dominion over any one he do not beget unless it can be suppose that a man can have a right to any thing without do that upon which that right be solely found for if a father by beget and no other title have natural dominion over his children he that do not beget them can not have this natural dominion over them and therefore be it true or false that our author say o that every man that be bear by his very birth become a subject to him that beget him this necessarily follow viz that a man by his birth can not become a subject to his brother who do not beget him unless it can be suppose that a man by the very same title can come to be under the natural and absolute dominion of two different men at once or it be sense to say that a man by birth be under the natural dominion of his father only because he beget him and a man by birth also be under the natural dominion of his eldest brother though he do not beget him if then the private dominion of adam ie his property in the creatures descend at his death all entirely to his eldest son his heir for if it do not there be presently an end of all sir roberts monarchy and his natural dominion the dominion a father have over his children by beget them belong immediately upon adams decease equally to all his sons who have children by the same title their father have it the sovereignty found upon property and the sovereignty found upon fatherhood come to be divide since cain as heir have that of property alone seth and the other sons that of fatherhood equally with him this be the best can be make of our author doctrine and of the two title of sovereignty he set up in adam one of them will either signify nothing or if they both must stand they can serve only to confound the right of princes and disorder government in his posterity for by build upon two title to dominion which can not descend together and which he allow may be separate for he yield that adams children have their distinct territories by right of private dominion o p he make it perpetually a doubt upon his principles where the sovereignty be or to whom we owe our obedience since fatherhood and property be distinct title and begin presently upon adams death to be in distinct persons and which then be to give way to the other let us take the account of it as he himself give it us he tell us out of grotius that adams children by donation assignation or some kind of cession before he be dead have their distinct territories by right of private dominion abel have his flock and pasture for them cain have his field for corn and the land of nod where he build him a city o here it be obvious to demand which of these two after adams death be sovereign cain say our author p by what title as heir for heirs to progenitors who be natural parent of their people be not only lord of their own children but also of their brethren say our author p what be cain heir to not the entire possessions not all that which adam have private dominion in for our author allow that abel by a title derive from his father have his distinct territory for pasture by right of private dominion what then abel have by private dominion be exempt from cains dominion for he could not have private dominion over that which be under the private dominion of another and therefore his sovereignty over his brother be go with this private dominion and so there be presently two sovereigns and his imaginary title of fatherhood be out of doors and cain be no prince over his brother or else if cain retain his sovereignty over abel notwithstanding his private dominion it will follow that the first ground and principles of government have nothing to do with property whatever our author say to the contrary it be true abel do not outlive his father adam but that make nothing to the argument which will hold good against sir robert in abels issue or in seth or any of the posterity of adam not descend from cain the same inconvenience he run into about the three sons of noah who as he say p have the whole world divide amongst them by their father i ask then in which of the three we shall find the establishment of regal power after noahs death if in all three as our author there seem to say then it will follow that regal power be found in property of land and follow private dominion and not in paternal power or natural dominion and so there be an end of paternal power as the fountain of regal authority and the so much magnify fatherhood quite vanish if the regal power descend to shem as eldest and heir to his father then noahs division of the world by lot to his sons or his ten years sail about the mediterranean to appoint each son his part which our author tell of p be labour lose his division of the world to them be to ill or to no purpose for his grant to cham and japhet be little worth if shem notwithstanding this grant as soon as noah be dead be to be lord over them or if this grant of private dominion to them over their assign territories be good here be set up two distinct sort of power not subordinate one to the other with all those inconveniencies which he muster up against the power of the people o which i shall set down in his own word only change property or people all power on earth be either derive or usurper from the fatherly power there be no other original to be find of any power whatsoever for if there should be grant two sort of power without any subordination of one to the other they would be in perpetual strife which should be supreme for two supremes can not agree if the fatherly power be supreme then the power ground on private dominion must be subordinate and depend on it and if the power ground on property be supreme then the fatherly power must submit to it and can not be exercise without the licence of the proprietors which must quite destroy the frame and course of nature this be his own argue against two distinct independent power which i have set down in his own word only put power rise from property for power of the people and when he have answer what he himself have urge here against two distinct power we shall be better able to see how with any tolerable sense he can derive all regal authority from the natural anal private dominion of adam from fatherhood and property together which be distinct title that do not always meet in the same persons and it be plain by his own confession presently separate as soon both as adams and noahs death make way for succession though our author frequently in his write jumble them together and omit not to make use of either where he think it will sound best to his purpose but the absurdities of this will more fully appear in the next chapter where we shall examine the ways of coveyance of the sovereignty of adam to princes that be to reign after him iii of the conveyance of adams sovereigns monarchical power sir robert have not be very happy in any proof he bring for the sovereignty of adam be not much more fortunate in convey it to future princes who if his politics be true must all derive their title from that first monarch the ways he have assign as they lie scatter up and down in his write i will set down in his own word in his preface he tell us that adam be monarch of the whole world none of his posterity have any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him here he snake two ways of conveyance of any thing adam stand possess of and those be grant or succession again he say all kings either be or arc to be repute the next heirs to those first progenitors who be at first the natural parent of the whole people p there can not be any multitude of men whatsoever but that in it consider by itself there be one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be the king of all the rest as be the next heir to adam o here in these place inheritance be the only way he allow of convey monarchical power to princes in other place he tell us o all power on earth be either derive or usurp from the fatherly power o all kings that now be or ever be be or be either father of their people or heirs of such father or usurpers of the right of such father o and here he make inheritance or usurpation the only way whereby kings come by this original power but yet he tell us this fatherly empire as it be of itself hereditary so it be alienable by patent and seizable by an usurper o so then here inheritance grant or usurpation will convey it and last of all which be most admirable he tell us p it skills not which way kings come by their power whether by election donation succession or by any other mean for it be still the manner of the government by supreme popover that make them properly kings and not the mean of obtain their crown which i think be a full answer to all his whole hypothesis and discourse about adams royal authority as the fountain from which all princes be to derive theirs and he might have spar the trouble of speak so much as he do up and down of heirs and inheritance if to make any one properly a king need no more but govern by supreme power and it matter not by what mean he come by it by this notable way our author may make oliver as properly king as any one else he could think of and have he have the happiness to live under massaniellos government he could not by this his own rule have forbear to have do homage to him with o king live for ever since the manner of his government by supreme power make him properly king who be but the day before properly a fisherman and if don quixote have teach his squire to govern with supreme authority our author no doubt could have make a most loyal subject in sancho panchas island he must need have deserve some preferment in such governments since i think he be the first politician who pretend to settle government upon its true basis renal to establish the throne of lawful princes ever tell the world that he be properly a king whose manner of government be by supreme power by what mean soever he obtain it which in plain english be to say that regal and supreme power be properly and truly his who can by any mean seize upon it and if this be to be properly a king i wonder how he come to think of or where he will find an usurper this be so strange a doctrine that the surprise of it hath make me pass by without their due reflection the contradictions he run into by make sometimes inheritance alone sometimes only grant or inheritance sometimes only inheritance or usurpation sometimes all these three and at last election or any other mean add to them the ways whereby adams royal authority that be his right to supreme rule could be convey down to future kings and governors so as to give them a title to the obedience and subjection of the people but these contradictions lie so open that the very read of our author own word will discover them to any ordinary understand and though what i have quote out of him with abundance more of the same strain and coherence which might be find in him might well excuse me from any farther treble in this argument yet have propose to myself to examine the main part of his doctrine i shall a little more particularly consider how inheritance grant usurpation or election can any way make out government in the world upon his principles or derive to any one a right of empire froin this regal authority of adam have it be ever so well prove that he have be absolute monarch and lord of the whole world of monarchy by inheritance from adam though it be ever so plain that there ought to be government in the world nay should all men be of our author mind that divine appointment have ordain it to be monarchical yet since men can not obey any thing that can not command and ideas of government in the fancy though ever so perfect though ever so right can not give laws nor prescribe rule to the action of men it would be of no behoof for the settle of order and establishment of government in its exercise and use amongst men unless there be a way also teach how to know the person to whom it belong to have this power and exercise this dominion over others it be in vain then to talk of subjection and obedience without tell us whom we be to obey for be i ever so fully persuade that there ought to be magistracy and rule in the world yet i be nevertheless at liberty still till it appear who be the person that hath right to my obedience since if there be no mark to know him by and distinguish him that hath right to rule from other men it may be myself as well as any other and therefore though submission to government be every ones duty yet since that signify nothing but submit to the direction and laws of such men as have authority to command it be not enough to make a man a subject to convince him that there be regal power in the world but there must be ways of design and know the person to whom this regal power of right belong and a man can never be oblige in conscience to submit to any power unless he can be satisfy who be the person who have a right to exercise that power over him if this be not so there would be no distinction between pirate and lawful princes he that have force be without any more ado to be obey and crown and sceptres would become the inheritance only of violence and rapine men too might as often and as innocently change their governors as they do their physicians if the person can not be know who have a right to direct me and whose prescriptions i be bind to follow to settle therefore mens consciences under an obligation to obedience it be necessary that they know not only that there be a power somewhere in the world but the person who by right be vest with this power over them how successful our author have be in his attempt to set up a monarchical absolute power in adam the reader may judge by what have be already say but be that absolute monarchy as clear as our author would desire it as i presume it be the contrary yet it could be of no use to the government of mankind now in the world unless he also make out these two things first that this power of adam be not to end with him but be upon his decease convey entire to some other person and so on to posterity secondly that the princes and rulers now on earth be possess of this power of adam by a right way of conveyance derive to them if the first of these fail the power of adam be it ever so great ever so certain will signify nothing to the present government and societies in the world but we must seek out some other original of power for the government of polities than this of adam or else there will be none at all in the world if the latter fail it will destroy the authority of the present governors and absolve the people from subjection to them since they have no better claim than others to that power which be alone the fountain of all authority can have no title to rule over them our author have fancy an absolute sovereignty in adam mention several ways of its conveyance to princes that be to be his successors but that which he chiefly insist on be that of inheritance which occur so often in his several discourse and i have in the forego chapter quote several of these passages i shall not need here again to repeat them this sovereignty he erect as have be say upon a double foundation viz that of property and that of fatherhood one be the right he be suppose to have in all creatures a right to possess the earth with the beasts and other inferior rank of things in it for his private use exclusive of all other men the other be the right he be suppose to have to rule and govern men all the rest of mankind in both these right there be suppose an exclusion of all other men it must be upon some reason peculiar to adam that they must both be found that of his property our author suppose to rise from gods immediate donation gen i and that of fatherhood from the act of beget now in all inheritance if the heir succeed not to the reason upon which his father right be found he can not succeed to the right which followeth from it for example adam have a right of property in the creatures upon the donation and grant of god almighty who be lord and proprietor ofthem all let this be so as our author tell us yet upon his death his heir can have no title to them no such right of property in them unless the same reason viz gods donation vest a right in the heir too for if adam could have have no property in nor use of the creatures without this positive donation from god and this donation be only personally to adam his heir could have no right by it but upon his death it must revert to god the lord and owner again for positive grant give no title farther than the express word convey it and by which only it be hold and thus if as our author himself contend that donation gen i be make only to adam personally his heir could not succeed to his property in the creatures and if it be a donation to any but adam let it be show that it be to his heir in our author sense ie to one of his children exclusive of all the rest but not to follow our author too far out of the way the plain of the case be this god have make man and plant in him as in all other animals a strong desire of selfpreservation and furnish the world with things fit for food and raiment and other necessaries of life subservient to his design that man should live and abide for some time upon the face of the earth and not that so curious and wonderful a piece of workmanship by his own negligence or want of necessaries should perish again presently after a few moments continuance god i say have make man and the world thus speak to him that be direct him by his sense and reason as he do the inferior animals by their sense and instinct which be serviceable for his subsistence and give him as the mean of his preservation and therefore i could not but before these word be pronounce gen i if they must be understand literally to have be speak and without any such verbal donation man have a right to an use of the creatures by the will and grant of god for the desire strong desire of preserve his life and be have be plant in him as a principle of action by god himself reason which be the voice of god in him could not but teach him and assure him that pursue that natural inclination he have to preserve his be he follow the will of his maker and therefore have a right to make use of those creatures which by his rear son or sense he could discover would be serviceable thereunto and thus man property in the creatures be found upon the right he have to make use of those things that be necessary or useful to his be this be the reason and foundation of adams property give the same title on the same grind to all his children not only after his death but in his life time so that here be no privilege of his heir above his other children which could exclude them from an equal right to the use of the inferior creatures for the comfortable preservation of their be which be all the property man hath in them and so adams sovereignty build on property or as our author call it private dominion come to nothing every man have a right to the creatures by the same title adam have viz by the right every one have to take care of and provide for their subsistence and thus men have a right in common adams children in common with him but if any one lead begin and make himself a property in any particular thing which how he or any one else could do shall be show in another place that thing that possession if he dispose not otherwise of it by his positive grant descend naturally to his children and they have a right to succeed to it and possess it it might reasonably be ask here how cone children by this right of possess before any other the properties of their parent upon their decease for it be personally the parent when they die without actually transfer their right to another why do it not return again to the common stock of mankind it perhaps be answer that common consent hath dispose of it totheir children common practice we see indeed do so dispose of it but we can not say that it be the common consent of mankind for that hath never be ask nor actually give and it common tacit consent hath establish it it would make but a positive and not a natural right of children to inherit the goods of their parent but where the practice be universal it be reason able to think the cause be natural the grind then i think to be this the first and strongest desire god plant in men and work into the very principles of their nature be that of selfpreservation that be the foundation of a right to the creatures for the particular support and use of each individual person himself but next to this god plant in men a strong desire also of propagate their kind and continue themselves in their posterity and this give children a title to share in the property of their parent and a right to inherit their possessions men be not proprietors of what they have merely for themselves their children have a title to part of it and have their kind of right join with their parent in the possession which come to be wholly theirs when death have put an end to their parent use of it hath take them from their possessions and this eve call inheritance men be by a like obligation bind to preserve what they have beget as to preserve themselves their issue come to have a right in the goods they be possess of that children have such a right be plain from the laws of god and that men arc convince that children have surly a right be evident from the law of the land both which laws require parent to provide for their children for children be by the course of nature bear weak and unable to provide for themselves they have by the appointment of god himself who hath thus order the course of nature a right to be nourish and maintain by their parent nay a right not only to a bare subsistence but to the convenicncics and comfort of life as far as the condition of their parent can afford it hence it come that when their parent leave the world and so the care due to their children cease the effect of it be to extend as far as possibly they can and the provision they have make in their lifetime be understand to be intendecl as nature require they should for their children whom after themselves they be bind to provide for though the die parent by express word declare nothing about them nature appoint the descent of their property to their children who thus come to have a title and natural right of inheritance to their father goods which the rest of mankind can not pretend to be it not for this right of be nourish and maintain by their parent which god and nature have give to children and oblige parent to as a duty it would be reasonable that the father should inherit the estate of his son and be prefer in the inheritance before his grandchild for to the grandfather there be due a long score of care and expense lay out upon the breed and education of his son which one would think in justice ought to be pay but that hay teen do in obedience to the same law whereby he receive nourishment and education from his own parent this score of education receive from a man father be pay by take care and provide for his own children be pay i say as much as be require of payment by alteration of property unless present necessity of the parent require a return of goods for their necessary support and subsistence for we be not now speak of that reverence acknowledgment respect and honour that be always due from children to their parent but of possessions and commodities of life valuable by money but though it be incumbent on parent to bring up and provide for their children yet this debt to their children do not quite cancel the score to their parent but only be make by nature preferable to it for the debt a man owe his father take place and give the father a right to inherit the sons goods where for want of issue the right of issue doth not exclude that title and therefore a man have a right to be maintain by his children where he need it and to enjoy also the comfort of life from them when the necessary provision due to them end their children will afford it if his son die without issue the father have a right in nature to possess his goods and inherit his estate whatever the municipal laws of some countries may absurdly direct otherwise and so again his children and their issue from him or for want of such his father and his issue but where no such be to be find ie no kindred there we see the possessions of a private man revert to the community and so in politic societies come into the hand of the public magistrate but in the state of nature become again perfectly common nobody have a right to inherit them nor can any one have a property in them otherwise than in any other things common by nature of which i shall speak in its due place i have be the larger in show upon what grind children have a right to succeedto the possession of their father properties not only because by it it will appear that if addend have a property a titular insignificant useless property for it could be no better for he be bind to nourish and maintain his children and posterity out of it in the whole earth and its product yet all his children come to have by the law of nature and right of inheritance a joint title and a right of property in it after his death it could convey no right of sovereignty to any one of his posterity over the rest since every one have a right of inheritance to his portion they might enjoy their inheritance or any part of it in common or share it or some part of it by division as it best like them but no one could pretend to the whole inheritance or any sovereignty suppose to accompany it since a right of inheritance give every one of the rest as well as any one a title to share in the goods of his father not only upon this account i say have i be so particular in examine the reason of childrens inherit the property of their father but also because it will give us farther light in the inheritance of rule and power which in countries where their particular municipal laws give the whole possession of land entirely to the firstborn and descent of power have go so to men by this custom that some have be apt to be deceive into an opinion that there be a natural or divine right of primogeniture to both estate and power and that the inheritance of both rule over men and property in things spring from the same original and be to descend by the same rule property whose original be from the right a man have to use any of the inferior creatures for the subsistence and comfort of his life be for the benefit and sole advantage of the proprietor so that he may even destroy the thing that he have property in by his use of it where need require but government be for the preservation of every man right and property by preserve him from the violence or injury of others be for the good of the govern for the magistrates sword be for a terror to evil doers and by that terror to enforce men to observe the positive laws of the society make conformable to the laws of nature for the public good ie the good of every particular member of that society as far as by common rule it can be provide for the sword be not give the magistrate for his own good alone children therefore as have be show by the dependence they have on their parent for subsistence have a right of inheritance to their father property as that which belong to them for their proper good and behoof and therefore be fitly term goods wherein the firstborn have not a sole or peculiar right by any law of god and nature the younger children have an equal title with him found on that right they all have to maintenance support and comfort from their parent and on nothing else but government be for the benefit of the govern and not the sole advantage of the governors but only for theirs with the rest as they make a part of that politic body each of whose part and members be take care of and direct in its peculiar function for the good of the whole by the laws of society can not be inherit by the same title that children have to the goods of their father the right a son have to be maintain and provide with the necessaries and conveniencies of life out of his father stock give him a right to succeed to his father property for his own good but this can give him no right to succeed also to the rule which his father have over other men all that a child have right to claim from his father be nourishment and education and the things nature furnish for the support of life but he have no right to demand rule or dominion from him he can subsist and receive from him the portion of good things and advantage of education naturally due to him without empire and dominion that if his father hath any be vest in him for the good and behoof of others and therefore the son can not claim or inherit it by a title which be found wholly on his own private good and advantage we must know low the first ruler from whom any one claim come by his authority upon what grind any one have empire what his title be to it before we can know who have a right to succeed him in it and inherit it from him if the agreement and consent of men first give a sceptre into any ones hand or put a crown on his head that also must direct its descent and conveyance for the same authority that make the first a lawful ruler must make the second too and so give right of succession in this case inheritance or primogeniture can in itself have no right no presence to it any farther than that consent which establish the form of the government hath so settle the succession and thus we see the succession of crown in several countries place it on different head and he come by right of succession to be a prince in one place who would be a subject in another if god by his positive grant and reveal declaration first give rule and dominion to any man he that will claim by that title must have the same positive grant of god for his succession for if that have not direct the course of its descent and conveyance clown to others nobody can succeed to this title of the first ruler children have no right of inheritance to this and primogeniture can lay no claim to it unless god the author of this constitution hath so ordain it thus we see the pretensions of sauls family who receive his crown from the immediate appointment of god end with his reign and david by the same title that saul reign viz gods appointment succeed in his throne to the exclusion of jonathan and all pretensions of paternal inheritance and if solomon have a right to succeed his father it must be by some other title than that of primogeniture a cadet or sisters son must have the preference in succession if he have the same title the first lawful prince have and in dominion that have its foundation only in the positive appointment of god himself benjamin the youngest must have the inheritance of the crown if god so direct as well as one of that tribe have the first possession if paternal right the act of beget give a man rule and dominion inheritance or primogeniture can give no title for he that can not succeed to his father title which be beget can not succeed to that power over his brethren which his father have by paternal right over them but of this i shall have occasion to say more in another place this be plain in the meantime that any government whether suppose to be at first found in paternal right consent of the people or the positive appointment of god himself which can supersede either of the other and so begin a new government upon a new foundation i say any government begin upon either of these can by right of succession come to those only who have the title of him they succeed to power found on contract can descend only to him who have right by that contract power found on beget he only can have that beget and power found on the positive grant or donation of god he only can have by right of succession to whom that grant direct it from what i have say i think this be clear that a right to the use of the creatures be found originally in the right a man have to subsist and enjoy the conveniencies of life and the natural right children have to inherit the goods of their parent be found in the right they have to the same subsistence and commodities of life out of the stock of their parent who be therefore teach by natural love and tenderness to provide for them as a part of themselves and all this be only for the good of the proprietor or heir it can be no reason for childrens inherit of rule and dominion which have another original and a different end nor can primogeniture have any presence to a right of solely inherit either property or power as we shall in its due place see more fully it be enough to have show here that adams property or private dominion could not convey any sovereignty or rule to his heir who not have a right to inherit all his father possessions could not thereby come to have any sovereignty over his brethren and therefore if any sovereignty on account of his property have be vest in adam which in truth there be not yet it would have die with him as adams sovereignty if by virtue of be proprietor of the world he have any authority over men could not have be inherit by any of his children over the rest because they have the same title to divide the inheritance and every one have a right to a portion of his father possessions so neither could adams sovereignty by right of fatherhood if any such he have descend to any one of his children for it be in our author account a right acquire by beget to rule over those he have beget it be not a power possible to be inherit because the right be consequent to and build on an act perfectly personal make that power so too and impossible to be inherit for paternal power be a natural right rise only from the relation of father and son be as impossible to be inherit as the relation itself and a man may pretend as well to inherit the conjugal power of the husband whose heir he be have over his wife as he can to inherit the paternal power a father over his children for the power of the husband be found on contract and the power of the father on beget he may as well inherit the power obtain by the conjugal contract which be only personal as he may the power obtain by beget which could reach no farther than the person of the begetter unless beget can be a title to power in him that do not beget which make it a reasonable question to ask whether adam die before eve his heir suppose cain or seth should have by right of inherit adams fatherhood sovereign power over eve his mother for adams father hood be nothing but a right he have to govern his children because he beget them he that inherit adams fatherhood inherit nothing even in our author sense but the right adam have to govern his children because he beget them so that the monarchy of the heir would not have take in eve or if it do it be nothing but the fatherhood of adam descend by inheritance the heir must have right to govern love because adam beget her for fatherhood s nothing else perhaps it will be say with our author that a man can alien his power over his child and what may be transfer by compact may be possess by inheritance i answer a father can not alien the power he have over his child he may perhaps to some degrees forfeit it but can not transfer it and if any other man acquire it it be not by the father grant but by some act of his own for example a father unnaturally careless of his child sell or give him to another man and he again expose him a third man find him breed him up cherish and provide for him as his own i think in this case nobody will doubt but that the greatest part of filial duty and subjection be here owe and to be pay to this fosterfather and if any thing could be demand from the child by either of the other it could be only due to his natural father who perhaps might have forfeit his right to much of that duty compre hended in the command honour your parent but could transfer none of it to another he that purchase and neglect the child get by his purchase and grant of the father no title to duty or honour from the child but only he acquire it who by his own authority perform the office and care of a father to the forlorn and perish infant make himself by paternal care a title to proportionable degrees of paternal power this will be more easily admit upon considerations of the nature of paternal power for which i refer my reader to the second book to return to the argument in hand this be evident that paternal power arise only from beget for in that our author place it alone can neither be transfer nor inherit and he that do not beget can no more have paternal power which arise from thence than he can have a right to any thing who perform not the condition to which only it be annex if one should ask by what law have a father power over his children it will be answer no doubt by the law of nature which give such a power over them to him that beget them if one should ask likewise by what law do our author heir come by a right to inherit i think it would be answer by the law of nature too for i find not that our author bring one word of scripture to prove the right of such an heir he speak of why then the law of nature give father paternal power over their children because they do beget them and the same law of nature give the paternal power to the heir over his brethren who do not beget them whence it follow that either the father have not his paternal power by beget or else that the heir have it not at all for it be hard to understand how the law of nature which be the law of reason can give the paternal power to the father over his children for the only reason of beget and to the firstborn over his brethren without this only reason ie for no reason at all and if the eldest by the law of nature can inherit this paternal power without the only reason that give a title to it so may the youngest as well as he and a stranger as well as either for where there be no reason for any one as there be not but for him that beget all have an equal title i be sure our author offer no reason and when any body do we shall see whether it will hold or no in the mean time it be as good sense to say that by the law of nature a man have right to inherit the property of another because he be of kin to him and be know to be of his blood and therefore by the same law of nature an utter stranger to his blood have right to inherit his estate as to say that by the law of nature he that beget them have paternal power over his children and therefore by the law of nature the heir that beget them not have this paternal power over them or suppose the law of the land give absolute power over their children to such only who nurse them and feed their children themselves could any body pretend that this law give any one who do no such thing absolute power over those who be not his children when therefore it can be show that conjugal power can belong to him that be not an husband it will also i believe be prove that our author paternal power acquire by beget may be inherit by a son and that a brother as heir to his father power may have paternal power over his brethren and by the same rule conjugal power too but till then i think we may rest satisfy that the paternal power of adam this sovereign authority of fatherhood be there any such could not descend to nor be inherit by his next heir fatherly power i easily grant our author if it will do him any good can never be lose because it will be as long in the world as there be father but none of then will have adams paternal power or derive theirs from him but every one will have his own by the same title adam have his viz by beget but not by inheritance or succession no more than husband have their conjugal power by inheritance from adam and thus we see as adam have no such property no such paternal power as give him sovereign jurisdiction over mankind so likewise his sovereignty build upon either of these title if he have any such could not have descend to his heir but must have end with him adam therefore as have be prove be neither monarch nor his imaginary monarchy hereditable the power which be now in the world be not that which be adams since all that adam could have upon our author ground either of property or fatherhood necessarily cry with him and could not be convey to posterity by inheritance in the next place we will consider whether adam have any such heir to inherit his power as our author talk of of the heir to adams monarchical power our author tell us o that it be a truth undeniable that there can not be any multitude of men whatsoever either great or small though gather together from the several corner and remotest regions of the world but that in the same multitude consider by itself there be one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be king of all the rest as be the next heir to adam and all the other subject to him every man by nature be a king or a subject and again p if adam himself be still live and now ready to die it be certain that there be one man and but one in the world who be next heir let this multitude of men be if our author please all the princes upon the earth there will then be by our author rule one amongst them that in nature hath a right to be king of all the rest as be the right heir to adam an excellent way to establish the throne of princes and settle the obedience of their subject by set up an hundred or perhaps a thousand title if there be so many princes in the world against any king now reign each as good upon our author ground as his who wear the crown if this right of heir carrier any weight with it if it be the ordinance of god as our author seem to tell us o must not all be subject to it from the highest to the lowest can those who wear the name of princes without have the right of be heirs to adam demand obedience from their subject by this title and not be bind to pay it by the same law either governments in the world be not to be claim and hold by this title of adams heir and then the start of it be to no purpose the be or not be adams heir signify nothing as to the title of dominion or if it really be as our author say the true title to government and sovereignty the first thing to be do be to find out this true heir of adam seat him in his throne and then all the kings and princes of the world ought to come and resign up their crown and sceptres to him as things that belong no more to them than to any of their subject for either this right in nature of adams heir to be king over all the race of men for all together they make one multitude be a right not necessary to the make of a lawful king and so there may be lawful kings without it and then kings title and pointer depend not on it or else all the kings in the world but one be not lawful kings and so have no right to obedience either this title of heir to adam be that whereby kings hold their crown and have a right to subjection from their subject and then one only can have it and the rest be subject can require no obedience from other men w ho be but their fellowsubjects or else it be not the title whereby kings rule and have a right to obedience from their subject and then kings be kings without it and this dream of the natural sovereignty of adams heir be of no use to obedience and government for if kings be a right to dominion and the obedience of their subject who be not nor can possibly be heirs to adam what use be there of such a title when we be oblige to obey without it if kings who be not heirs to adam have no right to sovereignty we be all free till our author or any body for him will show us adams right heir if there be but one heir of adam there can be but one lawful king in the world and noborly in conscience can be oblige to obedience till it be resolve who that be for it may be any one who be notknown to be of a younger house and all others have equal title if there be more than one heir of adam every one be his heir and so every one have regal power for if two sons can be heirs together then all the sons equally be heirs and so all be heirs be all sons or sons sons of adam betwixt these two the right of heir can not stand for by it either but one only man or all men be kings take which you please it dissolve the bond of government and obedience since if all men be heirs they can owe obedience to nobody if only one nobody can be oblige to pay obedience to him till he be know and his title make out who heir the great question which in all age have disturb mankind and bring on them the greatest part of those mischiefs which have ruin cities depopulate countries and disorder the peace of the world have be not whether there be power in the world nor whence it come but who should have it the settle of this point be of no smaller moment than the security of princes and the peace and welfare of their estates and kingdoms a reformer of politics one would think should lay this sure and be very clear in it for if this remain disputable all the rest will be to very little purpose and the skill use in dress up power with all the splendor and temptation absoluteness can add to it without show who have a right to have it will serve only to give a greater edge to man natural ambition which of itself be but too keen what can this do but set men on the more eagerly to scramble and so lay a sure and last foundation of endless contention and disorder instead of that peace and tranquillity which be the blurriness of government and the end of human society this designation of the person our author be more than ordinary oblige to take care of because he affirm that the assignment of civil power be by divine institution hath make the conveyance as well as the power itself sacred so that no consideration no act or art of man can divert it from that person to whom by this divine right it be assign no necessity or contrivance can substitute another person in his room for if the assignment of civil power be by divine institution and adams heir be he to whom it be thus assign as in the forego chapter our author tell us it would be as much sacrilege for any one to be king who be not adams heir as it would have be amongst the jews for any one to have be priest who have not be of aarons posterity for not only the priesthood in general be by divine institution but the assignment of it to the sole line and posterity of aaron make it impossible to be enjoy or exercise by any one but those persons who revere else offspring of aaron whose succession therefore be carefully observe and by that the persons who have a right to the priesthood certainly know let us see then what care our author have take to make us know who be this heir who by divine institution leas a right to be king over all men the first account of him we meet with be p in these word this subjection of children be the fountain of all regal authority by the ordination of god himself it follow that civil power not only in general be by divine institution but even the assignment of it specifically to the eldest parent matter of such consequence as this be should be in plain word as little liable as might be to doubt or equivocation and i think if language be capable of express any thing distinctly and clearly that of kindred and the several degrees of nearness of blood be one it be therefore to be wish that our author have use a little more intelligible expressions here that we might have better know who it be to whom the assignment of civil power be make by divine institution or at least would have tell us what he mean by eldest parent for i believe if land have be assign or grant to him and the eldest parent of his family he would have think it have need an interpreter and it would scarce have be know to whom next it belong in propriety of speech and certainly propriety of speech be necessary in a discourse of this nature eldest parent signify either the eldest men and women that have have children or those who have longest have issue and then our author assertion will be that those father and mother who have be longest in the world or longest fruitful have by divine institution a right to civil power if there be any absurdity in this our author must answer for it and if his mean be different from my explication he be to be blame that he would not speak it plainly this i be sure parent can not signify heirs male nor eldest parent an infant child who yet may sometimes be the true heir if there can be but one and we be hereby still as much at a loss who civil power belong to notwithstanding this assignment by divine institution as if there have be no such assignment at all or our author have say nothing of it this of eldest parent leave us more in the dark who by divine institution have a right to civil power than those who never hear any thing at all of heir or descent of which our author be so full and though the chief matter of his write be to teach obedience to those who have a right to it which he tell us be convey by descent yet who those be to whom this right by descent belong he leave like the philosophers stone in politics out of the reach of any one to discover from his write this obscurity can not be impute to want of language in so great a master of style as sir robert be when he be resolve with himself what he would say and therefore i fear find how hard it would be to settle rule of descent by divine institution and how little it would be to his purpose or conduce to the clear and establish the title of princes if such rule of descent be settle he choose rather to content himself with doubtful and general term which might make no ill sound in mens ears who be will to he please with them rather than offer any clear rule of descent of this fatherhood of adam by which mens consciences might be satisfy to whom it descend and know the persons who have a right to regal power and with it to their obedience how else be it possible that lay so much stress as he do upon descent and adams heir next heir true heir he should never tell us what heir mean nor the way to know who the next or true heir be this i do not remember he do any where expressly handle but where it come in his way very warily and doubtfully touch though it be so necessary that without it all discourse of government and obedience upon his principles would be to no purpose and fatherly power ever so well make out will be of no use to any body hence he tell us o that not only the constitution of power in general but the limitation of it to one kind ie monarchy and the determination of it to the individual person and line of adam be all three ordinances of god neither eve nor her children could either limit adams power or join others with him and what be give unto adam be give in his person to his posterity here again our author inform us that the divine ordinance hath limit the descent of aclams monarchical power to whom to adams line and posterity say our author a notable limitation a limitation to all mankind for if our author can find any one amongst mankind that be not of the line and posterity of adam he may perhaps tell him who this next heir of adam be but for us i despair how this limitation of adams empire to his line and posterity will help us to find out one heir this limitation indeed of our author will save those the labour who would look for him amongst the race of brutes if any such there be but will very little contribute to the discovery of one next heir amongst men though it make a short and easy determination of the question about the descent of adams regal power by tell us that the line and posterity of adam be to have it that be in plain english any one may have it since there be no person live that hath not the title of be of the line and posterity of adam and while it keep there it keep within our author limitation by gods ordinance indeed p he tell us that such heirs be not only lord of their own children but of their brethren whereby and by the word follow which we shall consider anon he seem to insinuate that the eldest son be heir but he nowhere that i know say it in direct word but by the instance of cain and jacob that there follow we may allow this to be so far his opinion concern heirs that where there be divers children the eldest son have the right to be heir that primogeniture can not give any title to paternal power we have already show that a father may have a natural right to some kind of power over his children be easily grant but that an elder brother have so over his brethren remain to be prove god or nature have not any where that i know place such jurisdiction in the first bear nor can reason find any such natural superiority amongst brethren the law of moses give a double portion of the goods and possessions to the eldest but we find not any here that naturally or by gods institution superiority or dominion belong to him and the instance there bring by our author be but slender proof of a right to civil power and dominion in the first bear and do rather show the contrary his word be in the forecited place and therefore we find god tell cain of his brother abel his desire shall be subject unto thee and thou shalt rule over him to which i answer these word of god to cain be by many interpreters with great reason understand in a quite different sense than what our author use them in whatever be mean by them it could not be that cain as elder have a natural dominion over abel for the word be conditional if thou dost well and so personal to cain and whatever be signify by them do depend on his carriage and not follow his birthright and therefore could by no mean be an establishment of dominion in the firstborn in general for before this abel have his distinct territories by right of private dominion as our author himself confess o which he could not have have to the prejudice of the heirs title if by divine institution cain as heir be to inherit all his father dominion if this be intend by god as the charter of primogeniture and the grant of dominion to the elder brothers in general as such by right of inheritance we might expect it should have include all his brethren for we may well suppose adam from whom the world be to be people have by this time that these be grow up to be men more sons than these two whereas abel himself be not so much as name and the word in the original can scarce with any good construction be apply to him it be too much to build a doctrine of so mighty consequence upon so doubtful and obscure a place of scripture which may well nay better be understand in a quite different sense and so can be but an ill proof be as doubtful as the thing to be prove by it especially when there be nothing else in scripture or reason to be find that favour or support it it follow p accordingly when jacob buy his brothers birthright isaac bless him thus be lord over thy brethren and let the sons of thy mother bow before thee another instance take it bring by our author to evince dominion due to birthright and an admirable one it be for it must be no ordinary way of reason in a man that be plead for the natural power of kings and against all compact to bring for proof of it an example where his own account of it found all the right upon compact and settle empire in the younger brother unless buy and sell be no compact for he tell us when jacob buy his birthright but pass by that let us consider the history itself with what use our author make of it and we shall find the follow mistake about it that our author report this as if isaac give jacob this bless immediately upon his purchase the birthright for he say when jacob buy isaac bless him which be plainly otherwise in the scripture for it appear there be a distance of time between and if we will take the story in the order it lie it must be no small distance all isaacs sojourn in gerar and transactions with abimelech gen xxvi come between rebecca be then beautiful and consequently young but isaac when he bless jacob be old and decrepit and esau also complain of jacob gen xxvii that two time he have supplant him he take away my birthrigllt say he and behold now he hath take away my bless word that i think signify distance of time and difference of action another mistake of our author be that he suppose isaac give jacob the bless and bid him be lord over his brethren because he have the birthright for our author bring this example to prove that he that have the birthright have thereby a right to be lord over his brethren but it be also manifest by the text that isaac have no consideration of jacobs have buy the birthright for when he bless him he consider him not as jacob but take him for esau nor do esau understand any such connexion between birthright and the bless for he say he hath supplant me these two time he take away my birthright and behold now he hath take away my bless whereas have the bless which be to be lord over his brethren belong to the birthright esau could not have complain of this second as a cheat jacob have get nothing but what esau have sell him when he sell him his birthright so that it be plain dominion if these word signify it be not understand to belong to the birthright and that in those days of the patriarchs dominion be not understand to be the right of the heir but only a greater portion of goods be plain from gen xxi for sarah take isaac to be heir say cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son whereby could be mean nothing but that he should not have a presence to an equal share of his father estate after his death but should have his portion presently and be go accordingly we read gen xxv that abraham give all that he have unto isaac but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham have abraham give gift and send them away from isaac his son while he yet live that be abraham have give portion to all his other sons and send them away that which he have reserve be the greatest part of his substance isaac as heir possess after his death but by be heir he have no right to be lord over his children for if he have why should sarah endeavour to rob him of one of his subject or lessen the number of his slave by desire to have ishmael send away thus as under the law the privilege of birthright be nothing but a double portion so we see that before moses in the patriarchs time from whence our author pretend to take his model there vas no knowledge no think that birthright give rule or empire paternal or kingly authority to any one over his brethren if this be not plain enough in the story of isaac and ishmael he that will look into chron v may there read these word reuben as the firstborn but forasmuch as he defile his father bed his birthright be give unto the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy be not to be reckon after the birthright for judah prevail above his brethren and of him come the chief ruler but the birthright be josephs what this birthright be jacob bless joseph gen xlviii telleth us in these word moreover i have give thee one portion above thy brethren which i take out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow whereby it be not only plain that the birthright be nothing but a double portion but the text in chronicle be express against our author doctrine and show that dominion be no part of the birthright for it tell us that joseph the birthright but judah the dominion one would think our author be very fond of the very name of birthright when he bring this instance of jacob and esau to prove that dominion belong to the heir over his brethren because it will be but an ill example to prove that dominion by gods ordination belong to the eldest son because jacob the youngest here have it let him come by it how he would for if it prove any thing it can only prove against our author that the assignment of dominion to the eldest be not by divine institution which would then be unalterable for if by the law of god or nature absolute power and empire belong to the eldest son and his heirs so that they be supreme monarchs and all the rest of their brethren slave our author give us reason to doubt whether the eldest son have a popover to part with it to the prejudice of his posterity since he tell us o that in grant and gift that have their original from god or nature no inferior power of man can limit or make any law of prescription against them because this place gen xxvii bring by our author concern not at all the dominion of one brother over the other nor the subjection of esau to jacob for it be plain in history that esau be never subject to jacob but live apart in mount seir where he found a distinct people and government and be himself prince over them as much as jacob be in his own family the text if consider can never be understand of esau himself or the personal dominion of jacob over him for the word brethren and sons of thy mother could not be use literally by isaac who know jacob have only one brother and these word be so far from be true in a literal sense or establish any dominion in jacob over esau that in the story we find the quite contrary for gen xxxii jacob several time call esau lord and himself his servant and gen xxxiii he bow himself seven time to the grind to esau whether esau then be a subject and vassal my as our author tell us all subject be slave to jacob and jacob his sovereign prince by birthright i leave the reader to judge and to believe if he can that these word of isaac be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother sons bow down to thee confirm jacob in a sovereignty over esau upon the account of the birthright he have get from him he that read the story of jacob and esau will find there never be any jurisdiction or authority that either of them have over the other after their father death they live with the friendship and equality of brethren neither lord neither slave to his brother but independent of each other be both head of their distinct families where they receive no laws from one another but live separately and be the root out of which spring two distinct people under two distinct governments this bless then of isaac whereon our author would build the dominion of the elder brother signify no more but what rebecca have be tell from god gen xxv two nations be in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separate from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger and so jacob bless judah gen xlix and give him the sceptre and dominion from whence our author might have argue as well that jurisdiction and dominion belong to the third son over his brethren as well as from this bless of isaac that it belong to jacob both these place contain only predictions of what should long after happen to their posterities and not any declaration of the right of inheritance to dominion in either and thus we have our author two great and only arguments to prove that heirs be lord over their brethren because god tell cain gen iv that however sin might set upon him he ought or might be master of it for the most learn interpreters understand the word of sin and not of abel anal give so strong reason for it that nothing can convincingly be infer from so doubtful a text to our author purpose because in this of gen xxvii isaac foretell that the israelites the posterity of jacob should have dominion over the edomites the posterity of esau therefore say our authorheirs be lord of their brethren i leave any one to judge of the conclusion and now we see our author have provide for the descend and conveyance down of adams monarchical power or paternal dominion to posterity by the inheritance of his heir succeed to all his father authority and become upon his death as much lord as his father be not only over his own children but over his brethren and all descend from his father and so in infinitum but yet who this heir be he do not once tell us and all the light we have from him in this so fundamental a point be only that in his instance of jacob by use the word birthright as that which pass from esau to jacob he leave us to guess that by heir he mean the eldest son though i do not remember he any where mention expressly the title of the firstborn but all along keep himself under the shelter of the indefinite term heir but take it to be have mean that the eldest son be heir for if the eldest be not there will be no presence why the sons should not be all heirs alike and so by right of primogeniture have dominion over his brethren this be but one step towards the settlement of succession and the difficulties remain still as much as ever till he can show us who be mean by right heir in all those case which may happen where the present possessor hath no son this he silently pass over and perhaps wisely too for what can be wiser after one have affirm that the person have that power as well as the power and form of government be the ordinance of god and by divine institution viz o p than to be careful not to start any question concern the person the resolution whereof will certainly lead him into a confession that god and nature hath determine nothing about him and if our author can not show who by right of nature or a clear positive law of god have the next right to inherit the dominion of this natural monarch he have be at such pain about when he die without a son he might have spar his pain in all the rest it be more necessary for the settle mens consciences and determine their subjection and allegiance to show them who by original right superior and antecedent to the will or any act of men hath a title to this paternal jurisdiction than it be to show that by nature there be such a jurisdiction it be to no purpose for me to know there be such a paternal power which i ought and be disposal to obey unless where there be many pretenders i also know the person that be rightfully in vest and endow with it for the main matter in question be concern the duty of my obedience and the obligation of conscience i be under to pay it to him that be of right my lord and ruler i must know the person that this right of paternal power reside in and so empower him to claim obedience from me for let it be true what he say p that civil power not only in general be by divine institution but even the assignment of it specially to the eldest parent and o that not only the power or right of government but the form of the power of govern and the person have that power be all the ordinance of god yet unless he show us in all case who be this person ordain by god who be this eldest parent all his abstract notions of monarchical power will signify just nothing when they be to be reduce to practice and men be conscientiously to pay their obedience for paternal jurisdiction be not the thing to be obey because it can not command but be only that which give one man a right which another hath not and if it come by inheritance another man can not have to command and be obey it be ridiculous to say i pay obedience to the paternal power when i obey him to whom paternal power give no right to my obedience for he can have no divine right to my obedience who can not show his divine right to the power of rule over me as well as that by divine right there be such a power in the world and hence not be able to make out any princes title to government as heir to adam which therefore be of no use and have be better let alone he be fain to resolve all into present possession and make civil obedience as due to an usurper as to a lawful king and thereby the usurpers title as good his word be o and they deserve to be remember if an usurper dispossess the true heir the subject obedience to the fatherly popover must go along and wait upon gods providence but i shall leave his title of usurpers to be examine in its due place and desire my sober reader to consider what thank princes owe such politics as this which can suppose paternal popover ie a right to government in the hand of a cade or a cromwell and so all obedience be due to paternal power the obedience of subject will be due to them by the same right and upon as good ground as it be to lawful princes and yet this as dangerous a doctrine as it be must necessarily follow from make all political power to be nothing else but adams paternal power by right and divine institution descend from him without be able to show to whom it descend or who be heir to it to settle government in the world and to lay obligations to obedience on any man conscience it be as necessary suppose with our author that all power be nothing but the be possess of adams fatherhood to satisfy him who have a right to this power this fatherhood when the possessor die without sons to succeed immediately to it as it be to tell him that upon the death of the father the eldest son have a right to it for it be still to be remember that the great question be and that which our author would be think to contend for if he do not sometimes forget it what persons have a right to be obey and not whether there be a power in the world which be to be call paternal without know in whom it reside for so it be a popover ie right to govern it matter not whether it be term paternal or regal natural or acquire whether you call it supreme fatherhood or supreme brotherhood will be all one provide we know who have it i go on then to ask whether in the inherit of this paternal power this supreme fatherhood the grandson by a daughter hath a right before a nephew by a brother whether the grandson by the eldest son be an infant before the younger son a man and able whether the daughter before the uncle or any other man descend by a male line whether a grandson by a younger daughter before a granddaughter by an elder daughter whether the elder son by a concubine before a younger son by a wife from whence also will arise many question of legitimation and what in nature be the difference betwixt a wife and a concubine for as to the municipal or positive laws of men they can signify nothing here it may farther be ask whether the eldest son be a fool shall inherit this paternal power before the younger a wise man and what degree of folly it must be that shall exclude him and who shall be judge of it whether the son of a fool exclude for his folly before the son of his wise brother who reign who have the paternal power whilst the widowqueen be with child by the decease king and nobody know whether it will be a son or a daughter which shall be heir of the two male twin who by the dissection of the mother be lay open to the world whether a sister by the halfblood before a brothers daughter by the whole blood these and many more such doubt might be propose about the title of succession and the right of inheritance and that not as idle speculations but such as in history we shall find have concern the inheritance of crown and kingdoms and if ours want them we need not go farther for famous examples of it than the other kingdom in this very island which have be fully relate by the ingenious and learn author of patriarcha non monarcha i need say no more of till our author hath resolve all the doubt that mall arise about the next heir and show that they be plainly determine by the law of nature or the reveal law of god all his suppositions of a monarchical absolute supreme paternal power in adam and the descent of that power to his heirs would not be of the least use to establish the authority or make out the title of any one prince now on earth but would rather unsettle and bring all into question for let our author tell us as long as he please and let all men believe it too that adam have a paternal and thereby a monarchical power that this the only power in the world descend to his heirs and that there be no other power in the world but this lot this be all as clear demonstration as it be manifest error yet if it be not past doubt to whom this paternal power descend and whose now it be nobody can be under any obligation of obedience unless any one will say that i be bind to pay obedience to paternal power in a man who have no more paternal power than i myself which be all one as to say i obey a man because he have a right to govern and if i be ask how i know he have a right to govern i should answer it can not be know that he have any at all for that can not be the reason of my obedience which i know not to be so much less can that be a reason of my obedience which nobody at all can know to be so and therefore all this ado about adams fatherhood the greatness of its power and the necessity of its supposal help nothing to establish the power of those that govern or to determine the obedience of subject who be to obey if they can not tell whom they be to obey or it can not be know who be to govern and who to obey in the state the world be now it be irrecoverably ignorant who be adams heir this fatherhood this monarchical power of adam descend to his heirs would be of no more use to the government of mankind than it would be to the quiet of men s consciences or secure their healths if our author have assure them that adam have a power to forgive sin or cure diseases which by divine institution descend to his heir whilst this heir be impossible to be know and should not he do as rationally who upon this assurance of our author go and confess his sin and expect a good absolution or take physic with expectation of health from any one who have take on himself the name of priest or physician or thrust himself into those employments say i acquiesce in the absolve power descend from adam or i shall be cure by the medicinal power descend from adam as he who say i submit to and obey the paternal lower descend from adam when it be confess all these power descend only to his single heir and that heir be unknown it be true the civil lawyers have pretend to determine some of these case concern the succession of princes but by our author principles they have meddle in a matter that belong not to them for if all political power be derive only from adam and be to descend only to his successive heirs by the ordinance of god and divine institution this be a right antecedent and paramount to all government and therefore the positive laws of men can not determine that which be itself the foundation of all law and government and be to receive its rule only from the law of god and nature and that be silent in the case i be apt to think there be no such right to be convey this way i be sure it would be to no purpose if there be and men would be more at a loss concern government and obedience to governors than if there be no such right since by positive laws and compact which divine institution if there be any shut out all these endless inextricable doubt can be safely provide against but it can never be understand how a divine natural right and that of such moment as be all order and peace in the world should be convey down to posterity without any plain natural or divine rule concern it and there would be an end of all civil government if the assignment of civil power be by divine institution to the heir and yet by that divine institution the person of the heir could not be know this paternal regal power be by divine right only his it leave no room for human prudence or consent to place it any where else for if only one man hath a divine right to the obedience of mankind nobody curl claim bleat obedience but he that can show that right nor can mens consciences by any other presence he oblige to it and thus this doctrine cut up all government by the root thus we see how our author lay it for a sure foundation that the very person that be to rule be the ordinance of god and by divine institution tell us at large only that this person be the heir but who this heir be he leave us to guess and so this divine institution which assign it to a person whom vie have no rule to know be just as good as an assignment to nobody at all but whatever our author do divine institution make no such ridiculous assignments nor can god be suppose to make it a sacred law that one certain person should have a right to something and yet not give rule to mark out and know that person by or give an heir a divine right to power and yet not point out who that heir be it be rather to be think that an heir have no such right by divine institution than that god should give such a right to the heir but yet leave it doubtful and undeterminable who such heir be if god lead give the land of canaan to abraham and in general term to somebody after him without name his seed whereby it might be know who that somebody be it would have be as good and useful an assignment to determine the right to the land of canaan as it would be the determine the right of crown to give empire to adam and his successive heirs after him without tell who his heir be for the word heir without a rule to know who it be signify no more than somebody i know not whom god make it a divine institution that men should not marry those who be of near kin think it not enough to say none of you shall approach to any that be near of kin to him to uncover albeit nakedness but moreover give rule to know who be those near of kin forbid by divine institution or else that law would have be of no use it be to no purpose to lay restraint or give privilege to men in such general term as the particular person concern can not be know by but god not have any where say the next heir shall inherit all his father estate or dominion we be not to wonder that he hath nowhere appoint who that heir should be for never have intend any such thing never design any heir in that sense we can not expect he should any where nominate or appoint any person to it as we might have it be otherwise and therefore in scripture though the word heir occur yet there be no such thing as heir in our author sense one that be by right of nature to inherit all that his father have exclusive of his brethren hence sarah suppose that if ishmael staid in the house to share in abrahams estate after his death this son of a bondwoman might be heir with isaac and therefore say she cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son but this can not excuse our author who tell us there be in every number of men one who be right and next heir to adam ought to have tell us what the laws of den scent be but he have be so spar to instruct us by rule how to know who be heir let us see in the next place what his history out of scripture on which he pretend wholly to build his government give us in this necessary and fundamental point our author to make good the title of his look p begin his history of the descent of adams regal power p in these word this lordship which adam by command have over the whole world and by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy be a large c how do he prove that the patriarchs by descent do enjoy it for dominion of life and deaths say he we find judah the father pronounce sentence of death against thamar his daughterinlaw for play the harlot p how do this prove that judah have absolute and sovereign authority he pronounce sentence of death the pronounce of sentence of death be not a certain mark of sovereignty but usually the office of inferior magistrates the power of make laws of life and death be indeed a mark of sovereignty but pronounce the sentence accord to those laws may be do by others and therefore this will but ill prove that he have sovereign authority as if one should say judge jefferies pronounce sentence of death in the late time therefore judge jefferies have sovereign authority but it will be say judah do it not by commission from another and therefore do it in his own right who know whether he have any right at all heat of passion might carry him to do that which he have no authority to do judah have dominion of life and death how do that appear he exercise it he pronounce sentence of death against thamar our author think it be very good proof that because he do it therefore he have a right to do it he lay with her also by the same way of proof he have a right to do that too if the consequence be good from do to a right of do absalom too may be reckon amongst our author sovereigns for he pronounce such a sentence of death against his brother amnon and much upon a like occasion and have it execute too if that be sufficient to prove a dominion of life and death but allow this all to be clear demonstration of sovereign power who be it that have this lordship by right descend to him from adam as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch judah say our author judah a younger son of jacob his father and elder brethren live so that if our author own proof be to be take a younger brother may in the life of his father and elder brothers by right of descent enjoy adams monarchical power and if one so qualify may be a monarch by descent why may not every man if judah his father and elder brethren live be one of adams heirs i know not who can be exclude from this inheritance all men by inheritance may be monarchs as well as judah touch war we see that abraham command an army of soldier of his own family and esau meet his brother jacob with men at arm for matter of peace abraham make a league with abimelech c p be it not possible for a man to have men in his family without be heir to adam a planter in the west indies have more and might if he please who doubt muster them up and lead them out against the indians to seek reparation upon any injury receive from them and an this without the absolute dominion of a monarch descend to him from adam would it not be an admirable argument to prove that all power by gods institution descend from adam by inheritance and that the very person and power of this planter be the ordinance of god because he have power in his family over servants bear in his house and buy with his money for this be just abrahams case those who be rich in the patriarchs days as in the west indies now buy men and maidservants and by their increase as well as purchase of new come to have large and numerous families which though they make use of in war or peace can it be think the power they have over them be an inheritance descend from adam when it be the purchase of their money a man rid in an expedition against an enemy his horse buy in a fair would be as good a proof that the owner enjoy the lordship which adam by command have over the whole world by right descend to him as abrahams lead out the servants of his family be that the patriarchs enjoy this lordship by descent from adam since the title to the power the master have in both case whether over slave or horse be only from his purchase and the get a dominion over any thing by bargain and money be a new way of prove one have it by descent and inheritance but make war and peace be mark of sovereignty let it be so in politic societies may not therefore a man in the west indies who hath with him sons of his own friends or companion soldier under pay or slave buy with money or perhaps a band make up of all these make war and peace if there should be occasion and ratify the article too with an oath without be a sovereign an absolute king over those who go with him he that say he can not must then allow many master of ship many private planters to be absolute monarchs for as much as this they have do war and peace can not be make for politic societies but by the supreme power of such societies because war and peace give a different motion to the force of such a politic body none can make war or peace but that which have the direction of the force of the whole body and that in politic societies be only the supreme power in voluntary societies for the time he that have such a power by consent may make war and peace and so may a single man for himself the state of war not consist in the number of partisans but the enmity of the party where they have no superior to appeal to the actual make of war or peace be no proof of any other power but only of dispose those to exercise or cease act of enmity for whom he make it and this power in many case any one may have without any politic supremacy and therefore the make of war or peace will not prove that every one that do so be a politic ruler much less a king for then commonwealths must be kings too for they do as certainly make war and peace as monarchical government but grant this a mark of sovereignty in abraham be it a proof of the descent to him of adams sovereignty over the whole world if it be it will surely be as good a proof of the descent of adams lordship to others too and then commonwealths as well as abraham will be heirs of adam for they make war and peace as well as he if you say that the lordship of adam doth not by right descend to commonwealths though they male war and peace the same say i of abraham and then there be an end of your argument if you stand to your argument and say those that do make war and peace as commonwealths do without doubt do inherit adams lordship there be an end of your monarchy unless you will say that commonwealths by descent enjoy adams lordship be monarchies and that indeed would be a new way of make all the governments in the world monarchical to give our author the honour of this new invention for i confess it be not i have first find it out by trace his principles and so charge it on him it be fit my readers know that as absurd as it may seem he teach it himself p where he ingenuously say in all kingdoms and commonwealths in the world whether the prince be the supreme father of the people or but the true heir to such a father or come to the crown by usurpation or election or whether some few or a multitude govern the commonwealth yet still the authority that be in any one or in many or in all these be the only right and natural authority of a supreme father which right of fatherhood he often tell us be regal and royal authority as particularly p the page immediately precede this instance of abraham this regal authority he say those that govern commonwealths have and if it be true that regal and royal authority be in those that govern commonwealths it be as true that commonwealths be govern by kings for if regal authority be in him that govern he that govern must need be a king and so all common wealths be nothing but downright monarchies and then what need any more ado about the matter the governments of the world be as they should be there be nothing but monarchy in it this without doubt be the surest way our author could have find to turn all other governments but monarchical out of the world but all this scarce prove abraham to have be a king as heir to adam if by inheritance he kind be king lot who be of the same family must need have be his subject by that title before the servants in his family but we see they live as friends and equal and when their herdsmen could not agree there be no presence of jurisdiction or superiority between them but they part by consent gen xiii hence he be call both by abraham and by the text abrahams brother the name of friendship and equality and not of jurisdiction and authority though he be really but his nephew and if our author know that abraham be adams heir and a king it be more it seem than abraham himself know or his servant whom he send a woo for his son for when he set out the advantage of the match gen xxiv thereby to prevail with the young woman and her friends he say i be abrahams servant and the lord hath bless my master greatly and he be become great and he hath give him flock and herd and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses and sarah my master wife bare a son to my master when she be old and unto him hath he give all he hath can one think that a discreet servant that be thus particular to set out his master greatness would have omit the crown isaac be to have if he have know of any such can it be imagine he should have neglect to have tell them on such an occasion as this that abraham be a king a name well know at that time for he have nine of them his neighbour if he or his master have think any such thing the likeliest matter of all the rest to make his errand successful but this discovery it seem be reserve for our author to make two or years after and let him enjoy the credit of it only he should have take care that some of adams land should have descend to this his heir as well as all adams lordship for though this lordship which abraham if we may believe our author as well as the other patriarchs by right descend to him do enjoy be as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch which hath be since the creation yet his estate his territories his dominions be very narrow and scanty for he have not the possession of a foot of land till he buy a field and a cave of the sons of heth to bury sarah in the instance of esau join with this of abraham to prove that the lordship which adam have over the whole world by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy be yet more pleasant than the former esau meet his brother jacob with men at arm he therefore be a king by right of heir to adam four hundred arm men then however get together be enough to prove him that lead them to be a king and adams heir there have be tories in ireland whatever there be in other countries who would have thank our author for so honourable an opinion of them especially if there have be nobody near with a better title of arm men to question their royal authority of it be a shame for men to trifle so to say no worse of it in so serious an argument here esau be bring as a proof that adams lordship adams absolute dominion as large as that of any monarch descend by right to the patriarchs and in this very chap p jacob be bring as an instance of one that by birthright be lord over his brethren so we have here two brothers absolute monarchs by the same title and at the same time heirs to adam the eldest heir to adam because he meet his brother with men and the youngest heir to adam by birth right esau enjoy the lordship which adam have over the whole world by right descend to him in as large and ample manner as the absolutest dominion of any monarch and at the same time jacob lord over him by the right heirs have to be lord over their brethren risum teneatis i never i confess meet with any man of part so dexterous as sir robert at this way of argue but it w as his misfortune to light upon an hypothesis that could not be accommodate to the nature of things and human affairs his principles could not be make to agree with that constitution and order which god lead settle in the world and therefore must need often clash with common sense and experience in the next section he tell us this patriarchal power continue not only till the flood but after it as the name patriarch cloth in part prove the word patriarch cloth more than in part prove that patriarchal power continue in the world as long as there be patriarchs for it be necessary that patriarchal power should be whilst there be patriarchs as it be necessary there should be paternal or conjugal power whilst there be father or husband but this be but play with name that which he would fallaciously insinuate be the thing in question to be prove viz that the lordship which adam have over the world the suppose absolute universal dominion of adam by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy if he affirm such an absolute monarchy continue to the flood in the world i would be glad to know what record he have it from for i confess i can not find a word of it in my bible if by patriarchal power he mean any thing else it be nothing to the matter in hand and how the name patriarch in some part prove that those who be call by that name have absolute monarchical power i confess i do not see and therefore i think need no answer till the argument from it be make out a little clearer the three sons of noah have the world say our author divide amongst them by their father for of them be the whole world overspread p the world might be overspread by the offspring of noahs sons though he never divide the world amongst them for the earth might be replenish without be divide so that all our author argument here prove no such division however i allow it to him and then ask the world be divide amongst them which of the three be adams heir if adams lordship adams monarchy by right descend only to the eldest then the other two could be but his subject his slave if by right it descend to all three brothers by the same right it will descend to all mankind and then it will be impossible what he say p that heirs be lord of their brethren should be true but all brothers and consequently all men will be equal and independent all heirs to adams monarchy and consequently all monarchs too one as much as another but it will be say noah their father divide the world amongst them so that our author will allow more to noah than he will to god almighty for o he think it hard that god himself should give the world to noah and his sons to the prejudice of noahs birthright his word be noah be leave sole heir to the world why should it be think that god would disinherit him of his birthright and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children and yet he here think it fit that noah should disinherit shem of his birthright and divide the world betwixt him and his brethren so that his birthright when our author please must and when he please must not be sacred and inviolable if noah do divide the world between his sons and his assignment of dominions to them be good there be an end of divine institution all our author discourse of adams heir with whatsoever he build on it be quite out of doors the natural power of kings fall to the grind and then the form of the power govern and the person have that power will not be as he say they be o the ordinance of god but they will he ordinances of man for if the right of the heir be the ordinance of god a divine right no man father or not father can alter it if it be not a divine right it be only human depend on the will of man and so where human institution give it not the firstborn have no right at all above his brethren and men may put government into what hand and under what form they please he go on most of the civilest nations of the earth labour to fetch their original from some of the sons or nephews of noah p how many do most of the civilest nations amount to and who be they i fear the chinese a very great and civil people as well as several other people of the east west north and south trouble not themselves much about this matter all that believe the bible which i believe be our author most of the civilest nations must necessarily derive themselves from noah but for the rest of the world they think little of his sons or nephews but if the herald and antiquaries of all nations for it be these men generally that labour to find out the originals of nations or all the nations themselves stout labour to fetch their original from some of the sons or nephews of noah what would this be to prove that the lordship which adam have over the whole world by a right descend to the patriarchs whoever nations or race of men labour to fetch their original from may be conclude to be think by them men of renown famous to posterity for the greatness of their virtues and action but beyond these they look not nor consider who they be heirs to but look on them as such as raise themselves by their own virtue to a degree that would give lustre to those who in future age could pretend to derive themselves from them but if it be ogyges hercules brama tamerlain pharamond nay if jupiter and saturn be the name from whence divers race of men both ancient and modern have labour to derive their original will that prove that those men enjoy the lordship of adam by right descend to them if not this be but a flourish of our author to mislead his reader that in itself signify nothing to as much purpose be what he tell us p concern this division of the world that some say it be by lot and others that noah sail round the mediterranean in ten years and divide the world into asia afric and europe portion for his three sons america then it seem be leave to be his that could catch it why our author take such pain to prove the division of the world by noah to his sons and will not leave out an imagination though no better than a dream that he can find any where to favour it be hard to guess since such a division if it prove any thing must necessarily take away the title of adams heir unless three brothers can all together be heirs of adam and therefore the follow word howsoever the manner of this division be uncertain yet it be most certain the division be by families from noah and his children over which the parent be head and princes p if allow him to be true and of any force to prove that all the power in the world be nothing but the lordship of adams descend by right they will only prove that the father of the children be all heirs to this lordship of adam for if in those days cham and japhet and other parent besides the eldest son be head and princes over their families and have a right to divide the earth by families what hinder younger brothers be father of families from have the same right if cham and japhet be princes by right descend to them notwithstanding any title of heir in their eldest brother younger brothers by the same right descend to them be princes now and so all our author natural power of kings will reach no farther than their own children and no kingdom by this natural right can be bigger than a family for either this lordship of adam over the whole world by right descend only to the eldest son and then there can be but one heir as our author say p or else it by right descend to all the sons equally and then every father of a family will have it as well as the three sons of noah take which you will it destroy the present governments and kingdoms that be now in the world since whoever have this natural power of a king by right descend to him must have it either as our author tell us cain have it and be lord over his brethren and so be alone king of the whole world or else as he tell us here shem cham and japhet have it three brothers and so be only prince of his own family and all families independent one of another all the world must be only one empire by the right of the next heir or else every family be a distinct government of itself by the lordship of adams descend to parent of families and to this only tend all the proof he here give us of the descent of adams lordship for continue his story of this descent he say in the dispersion of babel we must certainly find the establishment of royal power throughout the kingdoms of the world p if you must find it pray do and you will help us to a new piece of history but you must show it us before we shall be bind to believe that regal power be establish in the world upon your principles for that regal power be establish in the kingdoms of the world i think nobody will dispute but that there should be kingdoms in the world whose several kings enjoy their crown by right descend to them from adam that we think not only apocryphal but also utterly impossible if our author have no better foundation for his monarchy than a supposition of what be do at the dispersion of babel the monarchy he erect thereon whose top be to reach to heaven to unite mankind will serve only to divide and scatter them as that tower do and instead of establish civil government and order in the world will produce nothing but effusion for he tell us the nations they be divide into be distinct families which have father for rulers over them whereby it appear that even in the confusion god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority by distribute the diversity of languages accord to the diversity of families p it would have be a hard matter for any one but our author to have find out so plainly in the text he here bring that all the nations in that dispersion be govern by father and that god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority the word of the text be these be the sons of shem after their families after their tongue in their land after their station and the same thing be say of cham and japhet after an enumeration of their posterities in all which there be not one word say of their governors or form of government of father or fatherly authority but our author who be very quicksighted to spy out fatherhood where nobody else could see any the least glimpse of it tell us positively their rulers be father and god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority and why because those of the same family speak the same language and so of necessity in the division keep together just as if one should argue thus hannibal in his army consist of divers nations keep those of the same language together therefore father be captain of each band and hannibal be careful of the fatherly authority or in people of carolina the english french scotch and welsh that be there plant themselves together and by them the country be divide in their land after their tongue after their families after their nations therefore care be take of the fatherly authority or because in many part of america every little tribe be a distinct people with a different language one should infer that therefore god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority or that therefore their rulers enjoy adams lordship by right descend to them though we know not who be their governors nor what their form of government but only that they be divide into little indepen dent societies speak different languages the scripture say not a word of their rulers or form of government but only give an account how mankind come to be divide into distinct languages and nations and therefore it be not to argue from the authority of scripture to tell us positively father be their rulers when the scripture say no such thing but to set up fancy in ones own brain when we confidently aver matter of fact where record be utterly silent upon a like grind ie none at all he say that they be not confuse multitudes without head and governors and at liberty to choose what governors or governments they please for i demand when mankind be all yet of one language all congregate in the plain of shinar be they then all under one monarch who enjoy else lordship of adam by right descend to him if they be not there be then no thoughts it be plain of adams heir no right to government know then upon that title no care take by god or man of adams fatherly authority if when mankind be but one people dwell altogether and be of one language and be upon build a city together and when it be plain they could not but know the right heir for shem live till isaacs time a long while after the division at babel if then i say they be not under the monarchical government of adams fatherhood by right descend to the heir it be plain there w as no regard have to the fatherhood no monarchy acknowledge due to adams heir no empire of shems in asia and consequently no such division of the world by noah as our author have talk of as far as we can conclude any thing from scripture in this matter it seem from this place that if they have any government it be rather a commonwealth than an absolute monarchy for the scripture tell us gen xi they say it be not a prince command the build of this city and tower it be not by the command of one monarch but by the consultation of many a free people let us build us a city they build it for themselves as free men not as slave for their lord and master that we be not scatter abroad have a city once build and fix habitations to settle our abodes and families this be the consultation and design of a people that be at liberty to part asunder but desire to keep in one body and could not have be either necessary or likely in men tie together under the government of one monarch who if they have be as our author tell us all slave under the absolute dominion of a monarch need not have take such care to hinder themselves from wander out of the reach of his dominion i demand whether this be not plainer in scripture than any thing of adams heir or fatherly authority but if be as god say gen xi one people they have one ruler one king by natural right absolute and supreme over them what care have god to preserve the paternal authority of the supreme fatherhood if on a sudden he suffer for so many our author talk of distinct nations to be erect out of it under distinct governors and at once to withdraw themselves from the obedience of their sovereign this be to intitle gods care how and to what we please can it be sense to say that god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority in those who have it not for if these be subject under a supreme prince what authority have they be it an instance of gods care to preserve the fatherly authority when he take away the true supreme fatherhood of the natural monarch can it be reason to say that god for the preservation of fatherly authority let several new governments with their governors start up who could not all have fatherly authority and be it not as much reason to say that god be careful to destroy fatherly authority when he supers one who be in possession of it to have his government tear in piece and share by several of his subject would it not be an argument just like this for monarchical government to say when any monarchy be shatter to piece and divide amongst revolt subject that god be careful to preserve monarchical popover by rend a settle empire into a multitude of little governments if any one will say that what happen in providence to be preserve god be careful to preserve as a thing therefore to be esteem by men as necessary or useful it be a peculiar propriety of speech which every one will not think fit to imitate but this i an sure be impossible to be either proper or true speak that shem for example for he be then alive should have fatherly authority or sovereignty by right of fatherhood over that one people at babel and that the next moment shem yet live others should have fatherly authority or sovereignty by right of fatherhood over the same people divide into so many distinct governments either these father actually be rulers just before the confusion and then they be not one people but that god himself say they be or else they be a commonwealth and then where be monarchy or else these father have fatherly authority but know it not strange that fatherly authority should be the only original of government amongst men and yet all mankind not know it and stranger yet that the confusion of tongue should reveal it to them all of a sudden that in an instant these should know that they have fatherly power and all others know that they be to obey it in them and every one know that particular fatherly authority to which he be a subject he that can think this argue from scripture may from thence make out what model of an utopia will best suit with his fancy or interest and this fatherhood thus dispose of will justify both a prince who claim an universal monarchy and his subject who be father of families shall quit subjection to him and canton his empire into less governments for themselves for it will always remain a doubt in which of these the fatherly authority reside till our outlook resolve us whether shem who be then alive or these new princes begin so many new empires in his dominions and over his subject have right to govern since our author tell us that both one and the other have fatherly which be supreme authority and be bring in by him as instance of those who do enjoy the lordships of adam by right descend to them which be as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch this at least be unavoidable that if god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority in the newerected nations it necessarily follow that he be as careful to destroy all pretences of adams heir since he take care and therefore do preserve the fatherly authority in so many at least that could not possibly be adams heirs when the right heir if god have ever ordain any such inheritance could not but be know shem then live and they be all one people nimrod be his next instance of enjoy this patriarchal power p but i know not for what reason our author seem a little unkind to him and say that he against right enlarge his empire by seize violently on the right of other lord of families these lord of families here revere call father of families in his account of the dispersion at babel but it matter not how they be call so we know who they be for this fatherly authority must be in them either as heirs to adam and so there could not be nor above one at once or else as natural parent over their children and so every father will have paternal authority over his children by the same right and in as large extent as those have and so be independent princes over their own offspring take his lord of families in this latter sense as it be hard to give those word any other sense in this place he give us a very pretty account of the original of monarchy in these follow word p and in this sense he may be say to be the author and founder of monarchy viz as against right seize violently on the right of father over their children which paternal authority if it be in them by right of nature for else how could those come by it nobody can take from them without their own consent and then i desire our author and his friends to consider how far this will concern other princes and whether it will not accord to his conclusion of that paragraph resolve all regal power of those whose dominions extend beyond their families either into tyranny and usurpation or election and consent of father of families which will differ very little from consent of the people all his instance in the next section p of the dukes of edom the nine kings in a little corner of asia in abrahams days the kings in canaan destroy by joshua and the care he take to prove that these be all sovereign princes and that every town in those days have a king be so many direct proof against him that it be not the lordship of adam by right descend to them that make kings for if they have hold their royalties by that title either there must have be but one sovereign over them all or else every father of a family have be as good a prince and have as good a claim to royalty as these for if all the sons of esau have each of them the younger as well as the eldest the right of fatherhood and so be sovereign princes after their father death the same right have their sons after them and so on to all posterity which will limit all the natural power of fatherhood only to be over the issue of their own body and their descendents which power of fatherhood die with the head of each family and make way for the like power of fatherhood to take place in each of his sons over their respective posterities whereby the power of fatherhood will be preserve indeed and be intelligible but will not be at all to our author purpose none of the instance he bring be proof of any power they have as heirs of adams paternal authority by the title of his fatherhood descend to them no nor of any power they have by virtue of their own for adams fatherhood be over all mankind it could descend to but one at once and from him to his right heir only and so there could by that title be but one king in the world at a time and by right of fatherhood not descend from adam it must be only as they themselves be father end so could be over none but their own posterity so that if those dukes of edom if abraham and the nine kings his neighbour if jacob and esau and the kings in canaan the kings mutilate by adonibeseck the kings that come to benhadad the kings of greece make war at troy be as our author contend all of them sovereign princes it be evident that kings derive their power from some other original than fatherhoodsince some of these have power over more than their own posterity and it be demonstration they could not be all heirs to adam for i challenge any man to make any presence to power by right of fatherhood either intelligible or possible in any one otherwise than either as adams heir or as progenitor over his own descendents naturally spring from him and if our author could show that any one of these princes of which he give us here so large a catalogue have his authority by either of these title i think i might yield him the cause though it be manifest they be all impertinent and directly contrary to what he bring them to prove viz that the lordship which adam have over the world by right descend to the patriarchs have tell us p that the patriarchal government continue in abraham isaac and jacob until the egyptian bondage p he tell us by manifest footsteps we may trace this paternal government unto the israelites come into egypt allure the exercise of the supreme patriarchal government be intermit because they be in subjection to a stronger prince what these footsteps be of paternal government in our author sense ie of absolute monarchical power descend from adam and exercise by right of fatherhood we have see that be for years no footsteps at all since in all that time he can not produce any one example of any person who claim or exercise regal authority by right of fatherhood or show any one who be a king be adams heir all that his proof amount to be only this that there be father patriarchs and kings in that age of the world but that the father and patriarchs have any absolute arbitrary power or by what title those kings have theirs and of what extent it be the scripture be wholly silent it be manifest by right of fatherhood they neither do nor could claim any title to dominion or empire to say that the exercise of supreme patriarchal government be intermit because they be in subjection to a stronger prince prove nothing but what i before suspect viz that patriarchal jurisdiction or government be a fallacious expression and do not in our author signify what he would yet insinuate by it paternal and regal power such an absolute sovereignty as he suppose be in adam for how can he say that patriarchal jurisdiction be intermit in egypt where there be a king under whose regal government the israelites be if patriarchal be absolute monarchical jurisdiction and if it be not but something else why do he make such ado about a power not in question and nothing to the purpose the exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction if patriarchal be regal be not intermit whilst the israelites be in egypt it be true the exercise of regal power be not then in the hand of any of the promise seed of abraham nor before neither that i know but what be that to the intermission of regal authority as descend from adam unless our author will have it that this choose line of abraham have the right of inheritance to adams lordship and then to what purpose be his instance of the rulers in whom the fatherly authority be preserve in the confusion at isabel why do he bring the princes sons of ishmael and the dukes of edom and join them with abraham isaac and jacob as examples of the exercise of true patriarchal government if the exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction be intermit in the world whenever the heirs of jacob have not supreme power i fear supreme patriarchal jurisdiction be not only intermit but from the time of the egyptian bondage quite lose in the world since it will be hard to find from that time downwards any one who exercise it as an inheritance descend to him from the patriarchs abraham isaac and jacob i imagine monarchical government would have serve his turn in the hand of pharaoh or any body one can not easily discover in all place what his discourse tend to as particularly in this place it be not obvious to guess what he drive at when he say the exercise of supreme patriarchal jurisdiction in egypt or how this serve to make out the descent of adams lordship to the patriarchs or any body else for i think he have be give us out of scripture proof and examples of monarchical government found on paternal authority descend from adam and not an history of the jews amongst whom yet we find no kings till many years after they be a people and when kings be their rulers there be not the least mention or room for a presence that they be heirs to adam or kings by paternal authority i expect talk so much as he do of scripture that he would have produce thence a series of monarchs whose title be clear to adams fatherhood and who as heirs to him own and exercise paternal jurisdiction over their subject and that this be the true patriarchal government whereas he neither prove thee the patriarchs be kings nor that either kings or patriarchs be heirs to adam or so much as pretend to it and one may as well prove that the patriarchs be all absolute monarchs that the power both of patriarchs and kings be only paternal and that this power descend to them from adam i say all these proposition may be as well prove by a confuse account of a multitude of little kinds in the westindies out of ferdinando soto or any of our late histories of the northern america or by our author kings of greece out of homer as by any thing he bring out of scripture in that multitude of kings he have reckon up and methinks he should have let homer and his war of troy alone since his great zeal to truth or monarchy carry him to such a pitch of transport against philosophers and poets that he tell us in his preface that there be too many in these days who please themselves in run after the opinions of philosophers and poets to find out such an original of government as might promise them some title to liberty to the great scandal of christianity and bring in of atheism and yet these heathens philosopher aristotle and poet homer be not reject by our zealous christian politician whenever they over any thing that seem to serve his turn whether to the great scandal of christianity and bring in of atheism let him look this i can not but observe in author who it be visible write not for truth how ready zeal for interest and party be to entitle christianity to their design and to charge atheism on those who will not without examine submit to their doctrines and blindly swallow their nonsense but to return to his scripture history our author farther tell us p that after the return of the israelites out of bondage god out of a special care of them choose moses and joshua successively to govern as princes in the place and stead of the supreme father if it be true that they return out of bondage it must be in a state of freedom and must imply that both before and after this bondage they be free unless our author will say that change of master be return out of bondage or that a slave return out of bondage when he be remove from one gaily to another if then they return out of bondage it be plain that in those days whatever our author in his preface say to the contrary there be a difference between a son a subject and a slave and that neither the patriarchs before nor their rulers after this egyptian bondage number their sons or subject amongst their possessions and dispose of them with as absolute a dominion as they do their other goods this be evident in jacob to whom reuben offer his two sons as pledge and judah be at last surety for benjamins safe return out of egypt which all have be vain superfluous and but a sort of mockery if jacob have have the same power over every one of his family as he have over his ox or his ass as an owner over his substance and the offer that reuben or judah make have be such a security for return of benjamin as if a man should take two lamb out of his lord flock and offer one as security that he will safely restore the other when they be out of this bondage what then god out of a special care of them the israelites it be well that once in his book he will allow god to have any care of the people for in other place he speak of mankind as if god have no care of any part of them but only of their monarchs and that the rest of the people the societies of men be make as so many herd of cattle only for the service use and pleasure of their princes choose moses and joshua successively to govern as princes a shrewd argument our author have find out to prove gods care of the fatherly authority and adams heirs that here as an expression of his care of his own people he choose those for princes over them that have not the least presence to either the persons choose be moses of the tribe of levi and joshua of the tribe of ephraim neither of which have any title of fatherhood but say our author they be in the place and stead of the supreme father if god have any where as plainly declare his choice of such father to be rulers as he do of moses and joshua we might believe moses and joshua be in their place and stead but that be the question in debate till that be better prove moses be choose by god to be ruler of his people will no more prove that government belong to adams heir or to the fatherhood than gods choose aaron of the tribe of levi to be priest will prove that the priesthood belong to adams heir or the prime father since god would choose aaron to be priest and moses ruler in israel though neither of those offices be settle on adams heir or the fatherhood our author go on and after them likewise for a time he raise up judge to defend his people in time of peril p this prove fatherly authority to be the original of government and that it descend from adam to his heirs just as well as what go before only here our author seem to confess that these judge who be all the governors they then have be only men of velour whom they make their general to defend them in time of peril and can not god raise up such men unless fatherhood have a title to government but say our author when god give the israelites kings he reestablish the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government p how do god reestablish it by a law a positive command we find no such thing our author mean then that when god give theta a king in give them a king he reestablish the right c to reestablish defacto the right of lineal succession to paternal government be to put a man in possession of that government which his father do enjoy and he by lineal succession have a right to for first if it be another government than what his ancestor have it be not succeed to an ancient right but begin a new one for if a prince should give a man besides his ancient patrimony which for some age his family have be disseised of an additional estate never before in the possession of his ancestors he could not be say to reestablish the right of lineal succession to any more than what have be formerly enjoy by his ancestors if therefore the power the kings of israel have be any thing more than isaac or jacob have it be not the reestablish in them the right of succession to a power but give them a new power however you please to call it paternal or not and whether isaac and jacob have the same power that the kings of israel have i desire any one by what have be above say to consider and i do not think he will find that either abraham isaac or jacob have any regal power at all next there can be no reestablishment of the prime and ancient right of lineal succession to any thing unless he that be put in possession of it have the right to succeed and be the true and next heir to him he succeed to can that be a reestablishment which begin in a new family or that the reestablishment of an ancient right of lineal succession when a crown be give to one who have no right of succession to it and who if the lineal succession have go on have be out of all possibility of presence to it saul the first king god give the israelites be of the tribe of benjamin be the ancient and prime right of lineal succession reestablish in him the next be david the youngest son of jesse of the posterity of judah jacobs third son be the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government reestablish in him or in solomon his younger son and successor in the throne or in jeroboam over the ten tribes or in athaliah a woman who reign six years an utter stranger to the royal blood if the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government be reestablish in any of these or their posterity the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government belong to younger brothers as well as elder and may be reestablish in any man live for whatever younger brothers by ancient and prime right of lineal succession may have as well as the elder that every man live may have a right to by lineal succession and sir robert as well as any other and so what a brave right of lineal succession to his paternal or regal government our author have reestablish for the secure the right and inheritance of crown where every one may have it let the world consider but say our author however p whensoever god make choice of any special person to be king he intend that the issue also should have benefit thereof as be comprehend sufficiently in the person of the father although the father be only name in the grant this yet will not help out succession for if as our author say the benefit of the grant be intend to the issue of the grantee this will not direct the succession since if god give any thing to a man and his issue in general the claim can not be to any one of that issue in particular every one that be of his race will have an equal right if it be say our author mean heir i believe our author be as will as any body to have use that word if it would have serve his turn but solomon who succeed david in the throne be no more his heir than jeroboam who succeed him in the government of the ten tribes be his issue our author have reason to avoid say that god intend it to the heirs when that would not hold in a succession which our author could not except against and so he have leave his succession as undetermined as if he have say nothing about it for if the regal power be give by god to a man and his issue as the land of canaan be to abraham and his seed must they not all have a title to it all share in it and one may as well say that by gods grant to abraham and his seed the land of canaan be to belong only to one of his seed exclusive of all others as by gods grant of dominion to a man and his issue this dominion be to belong in peculiar to one of his issue exclusive of all others but how will our author prove that whensoever god make choice of any special person to be a king he intend that the i suppose he mean his issue also should have benefit thereof have he so soon forget moses and joshua whom in this very section he say god out of a special care choose to govern as princes and the judge that god raise up have not these princes have the same authority of the supreme fatherhood the same power that the kings have and be specially choose by god himself should not their issue have the benefit of that choice as well as davids or solomons if these have the paternal authority put into their hand immediately by god why have not their issue the benefit of this grant in a succession to this power or if they have it as adams heirs why do not their heirs enjoy it after them by right descend to them for they could not be heirs to one another be the power the same and from the same original in moses joshua and the judge as it be in david and the kings and be it inheritable in one and not in the other if it be not paternal authority then gods own people be govern by those that have not paternal authority and those governors do well enough without it if it be paternal authority and god choose the persons that be to exercise it our author rule fail that whensoever god make choice of any person to be supreme ruler for i suppose the name king have no spell in it it be not the title but the power make the difference he intend that the issue also should have the benefit of it since from their come out of egypt to davids time years the issue be never so sufficiently comprehend in the person of the father as that any son after the death of his father succeed to the government amongst all those judge that judge israel if to avoid this it be say god always choose the person of the successor and so transfer the fatherly authority to him exclude his issue from succeed to it that be manifestly not so in the story of jephthah where he article with the people and they make him judge over them as be plain judg xi it be in vain then to say that whensoever god choose any special person to have the exercise of paternal authority for if that be not to be king i desire to know the difference between a king and one have the exercise of paternal authority he intend the issue also should have the benefit of it since we find the authority the judge have end with them and descend not to their issue and if the judge have not paternal authority i fear it will trouble our author or any of the friends to his principles to tell who have then the paternal authority that be the government and supreme power amongst the israelites and i suspect they must confess that the choose people of god continue a people several hundreds of years without any knowledge or think of this paternal authority or any appearance of monarchical government at all to be satisfy of this he need but read the story of the levite and the war thereupon with the benjamites in the three last chapters of judge and when he find that the levite appeal to the people for justice that it be the tribes and the congregation that debate resolve and direct all that be do on that occasion he must conclude either that god be not careful to preserve the fatherly authority amongst his own choose people or else that the fatherly authority may be preserve where there be no monarchical government if the latter then it will follow that though fatherly authority be ever so well prove yet it will not infer a necessity of monarchical government if the former it will seem very strange and improbable that god should ordain fatherly authority to be so sacred amongst the sons of men that there could be no power or government without it and yet that amongst us own people even whilst he be provide a government for them and therein prescribe rule to the several state and relations of men this great and fundamental one this most material and necessary of all the rest should he conceal and lie neglect for years after before i leave this i must ask flow our author know that whensoever god make choice of any special person to be king he intend that the issue should have the benefit thereof do god by the law of nature or revelation say so by the same law also he must say which of his issue must enjoy the crown in succession and so point out the heir or else leave his issue to divide or scramble for the government both mike absurd and such as will destroy the benefit of such grant to the issue when any such declaration of gods intention be produce it will be our duty to believe god intend it so but till that be do our author must show us some better warrant before we shall be oblige to receive lie as the authentic revealer of gods intentions the issue say our author be comprehend sufficiently in the person of the father although the father only be name in the grant and yet god when he give the land of canaan to abraham gen xiii think fit to put his seed into the grant too so the priesthood be give to aaron and his seed and the crown god give not only to david but his seed also and however our author assure us that god intend that the issue should have the benefit of it when he choose any person to be king yet we see that the kingdom which he give to saul without mention his seed after him never come to any of his issue and why when god choose a person to be king he should intend that his issue should have the benefit of it more than when he choose one to be judge in israel i would fain know a reason or why do a errant of fatherly authority to a king more comprehend the issue than when a like grant be make to a judge be paternal authority by right to descend to the issue of one and not of the other there will need some reason to be show of this difference more than the name when the thing give be the same fatherly authority and the manner of give it gods choice of the person the same too for i suppose our author when he say god raise up judge will by no mean allow they be choose by the people but since our author have so confidently assure us of the care of god to preserve the fatherhood and pretend to build all he say upon the authority of the scripture we may well expect that that people whose law constitution and history be chiefly contain in the scripture should furnish him with the clearest instance of gods care of preserve the fatherly authority in that people who it be agree he have a most peculiar care of let us see then what state this paternal authority or government be in amongst the jews from their begin to be a people it be omit by our author confession from their come into egypt till their return out of that bondage above years from thence till god give the israelites a king about years more our author give but a very slender account of it nor indeed all that time be there the least footsteps of paternal or regal government amongst them but then say our author god reestablish the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government what a lineal succession to paternal government be then establish we have already see i only now consider how long this last and that be to their captivity about years from thence to their destruction by the romans above years after the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government be again lose and they continue a people in the promise land without it so that of years that they be gods peculiar people they have hereditary kingly government amongst them not onethird of the time and of that time there be not the least footstep of one moment of paternal government nor the reestablishment of the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to it whether we suppose it to be derive as from its fountain from david saul abraham or which upon our author principles be the only true from adam note in grant and gift that have their original from god or nature as the power of the father hath no inferior power of man can limit nor shake any law of prescription against them obs the scripture teach that supreme power be originally in the father without any limitation obs of political power it have be show in the forego discourse firstly that adam have not either by natural right of fatherhood or by positive donation from god any such authority over his children nor dominion over the world as be pretend secondly that if he have his heirs yet have no right to it thirdly that if his heirs have there be no law of nature nor positive law of god that determine which be the right heir in all case that may arise the right of succession and consequently of bear rule could not have be certainly determine fourthly that if even that have be determine yet the knowledge of which be the eldest line of adams posterity be so long since utterly lose that in the race of mankind and families of the world there remain not to one above another the least pretence to be the eldest house and to have the right of inheritance all these promise have as i think be clearly make out it be impossible that the rulers now on earth should make any benefit or derive any the least shadow of authority from that which be hold to be the fountain of all power adams private dominion and paternal jurisdiction so that he that will not give just occasion to think that all government in the world be the product only of force and violence and that men live together by no other rule but that of beasts where the strongest carry it and so lay a foundation for perpetual disorder and mischief tumult sedition and rebellion things that the followers of that hypothesis so loudly cry out against must of necessity find out another rise of government another original of political power and another way of design and know the persons that have it than what concern the true original extent and end of civil government sir robert filmer hath teach us to this purpose i think it may not be amiss to set down what i take to be political power that the power of a magistrate over a subject may be distinguish from that of a father over his children a master over his servant a husband over his wife and a lord over his slave all which distinct power happen sometimes together in the same man if he be consider under these different relations it may help us to distinguish these power one from another and show the difference betwixt a ruler of a commonwealth a father of a family and a captain of a galley political power then i take to be a right of make laws with penalties of death and consequently all less penalties for the regulate and preserve of property and of employ the force of the community in the execution of such laws and in the defence of the commonwealth from foreign injury and all this only for the public good of the state of nature to understand political power aright and derive it from its original we must consider what estate all men be naturally in and that be a state of perfect freedom to order their action and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit within the bound of the law of nature without ask leave or depend upon the will of any other man a state also of equality wherein all the power and jurisdiction be reciprocal no one have more than another there be nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously bear to all the same advantage of nature and the use of the same faculties should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection unless the lord and master of them all should by any manifest declaration of his will set one above another and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty this equality of men by nature the judicious hooker look upon as so evident in itself and beyond all question that he make it the foundation of that obligation to mutual love amongst men on which he build the duties they owe one another and from whence he derive the great maxims of justice and charity his word be the like natural inducement hath bring men to know that it be no less their duty to love others than themselves for see those things which be equal must need all have one measure if i can not but wish to receive good even as much at every man hand as any man can wish unto his own soul how should i look to have any part of my desire herein satisfy unless myself be careful to satisfy the like desire which be undoubtedly in other men weak be of one and the same nature to have anything offer them repugnant to this desire must need in all respect grieve them as much as me so that if i do harm i must look to suffer there be no reason that others should show greater measure of love to me than they have by me show unto them my desire therefore to be love of my equal in nature as much as possible may be imposeth upon me a natural duty of bear to themward fully the like affection from which relation of equality between ourselves and them that be as ourselves what several rule and canons natural reason hath draw for direction of life no man be ignorant eccl pol i but though this be a state of liberty yet it be not a state of licence though man in that state have an uncontrollable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions yet he have not liberty to destroy himself or so much as any creature in his possession but where some nobler use than its bare preservation call for it the state of nature have a law of nature to govern it which oblige every one and reason which be that law teach all mankind who will but consult it that be all equal and independent no one ought to harm another in his life health liberty or possessions for men be all the workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise maker all the servants of one sovereign master send into the world by his order and about his business they be his property whose workmanship they be make to last during his not one anothers pleasure and be furnish with like faculties share all in one community of nature there can not be suppose any such subordination among us that may authorise us to destroy one another as if we be make for one anothers use as the inferior rank of creatures be for ours every one as he be bind to preserve himself and not to quit his station wilfully so by the like reason when his own preservation come not in competition ought he as much as he can to preserve the rest of mankind and not unless it be to do justice on an offender take away or impair the life or what tend to the preservation of the life the liberty health limb or goods of another and that all men may be restrain from invade others right and from do hurt to one another and the law of nature be observe which willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind the execution of the law of nature be in that state put into every man hand whereby every one have a right to punish the transgressors of that law to such a degree as may hinder its violation for the law of nature would as all other laws that concern men in this world be in vain if there be nobody that in the state of nature have a power to execute that law and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders and if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he have do every one may do so for in that state of perfect equality where naturally there be no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another what any may do in prosecution of that law every one must need have a right to do and thus in the state of nature one man come by a power over another but yet no absolute or arbitrary power to use a criminal when he have get him in his hand accord to the passionate heat or boundless extravagancy of his own will but only to retribute to him so far as calm reason and conscience dictate what be proportionate to his transgression which be so much as may serve for reparation and restraint for these two be the only reason why one man may lawfully do harm to another which be that we call punishment in transgress the law of nature the offender declare himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity which be that measure god have set to the action of men for their mutual security and so he become dangerous to mankind the tie which be to secure them from injury and violence be slight and break by him which be a trespass against the whole species and the peace and safety of it provide for by the law of nature every man upon this score by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general may restrain or where it be necessary destroy things noxious to them and so may bring such evil on any one who hath transgress that law as may make him repent the do of it and thereby deter him and by his example others from do the like mischief and in this case and upon this grind every man hath a right to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature i doubt not but this will seem a very strange doctrine to some men but before they condemn it i desire them to resolve me by what right any prince or state can put to death or punish an alien for any crime he commit in their country it be certain their laws by virtue of any sanction they receive from the promulgate will of the legislature reach not a stranger they speak not to him nor if they do be he bind to hearken to them the legislative authority by which they be in force over the subject of that commonwealth hath no power over him those who have the supreme power of make laws in england france or holland be to an indian but like the rest of the worldmen without authority and therefore if by the law of nature every man hath not a power to punish offences against it as he soberly judge the case to require i see not how the magistrates of any community can punish an alien of another country since in reference to him they can have no more power than what every man naturally may have over another besides the crime which consist in violate the laws and vary from the right rule of reason whereby a man so far become degenerate and declare himself to quit the principles of human nature and to be a noxious creature there be commonly injury do and some person or other some other man receive damage by his transgression in which case he who hath receive any damage have besides the right of punishment common to him with other men a particular right to seek reparation from him that hath do it and any other person who find it just may also join with him that be injure and assist him in recover from the offender so much as may make satisfaction for the harm he hath suffer from these two distinct right the one of punish the crime for restraint and prevent the like offence which right of punish be in everybody the other of take reparation which belong only to the injure party come it to pass that the magistrate who by be magistrate hath the common right of punish put into his hand can often where the public good demand not the execution of the law remit the punishment of criminal offences by his own authority but yet can not remit the satisfaction due to any private man for the damage he have receive that he who hath suffer the damage have a right to demand in his own name and he alone can remit the damnified person have this power of appropriate to himself the goods or service of the offender by right of selfpreservation as every man have a power to punish the crime to prevent its be commit again by the right he have of preserve all mankind and do all reasonable things he can in order to that end and thus it be that every man in the state of nature have a power to kill a murderer both to deter others from do the like injury which no reparation can compensate by the example of the punishment that attend it from everybody and also to secure men from the attempt of a criminal who have renounce reason the common rule and measure god hath give to mankind hath by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath commit upon one declare war against all mankind and therefore may be destroy as a lion or a tiger one of those wild savage beasts with whom men can have no society nor security and upon this be ground that great law of nature whoso sheddeth man blood by man shall his blood be shed and cain be so fully convince that every one have a right to destroy such a criminal that after the murder of his brother he cry out every one that findeth me shall slay me so plain be it writ in the hearts of all mankind by the same reason may a man in the state of nature punish the lesser breach of that law it will perhaps be demand with death i answer each transgression may be punish to that degree and with so much severity as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the offender give him cause to repent and terrify others from do the like every offence that can be commit in the state of nature may in the state of nature be also punish equally and as far forth as it may in a commonwealth for though it would be beside my present purpose to enter here into the particulars of the law of nature or its measure of punishment yet it be certain there be such a law and that too as intelligible and plain to a rational creature and a studier of that law as the positive laws of commonwealths nay possibly plainer as much as reason be easier to be understand than the fancy and intricate contrivances of men follow contrary and hide interest put into word for truly so be a great part of the municipal laws of countries which be only so far right as they be found on the law of nature by which they be to be regulate and interpret to this strange doctrineviz that in the state of nature every one have the executive power of the law of naturei doubt not but it will be object that it be unreasonable for men to be judge in their own case that selflove will make men partial to themselves and their friends and on the other side illnature passion and revenge will carry them too far in punish others and hence nothing but confusion and disorder will follow and that therefore god hath certainly appoint government to restrain the partiality and violence of men i easily grant that civil government be the proper remedy for the inconvenience of the state of nature which must certainly be great where men may be judge in their own case since it be easy to be imagine that he who be so unjust as to do his brother an injury will scarce be so just as to condemn himself for it but i shall desire those who make this objection to remember that absolute monarchs be but men and if government be to be the remedy of those evils which necessarily follow from men be judge in their own case and the state of nature be therefore not to be endure i desire to know what kind of government that be and how much better it be than the state of nature where one man command a multitude have the liberty to be judge in his own case and may do to all his subject whatever he please without the least question or control of those who execute his pleasure and in whatsoever he doth whether lead by reason mistake or passion must be submit to which men in the state of nature be not bind to do one to another and if he that judge judge amiss in his own or any other case he be answerable for it to the rest of mankind it be often ask as a mighty objection where be or ever be there any men in such a state of nature to which it may suffice as an answer at present that since all princes and rulers of independent governments all through the world be in a state of nature it be plain the world never be nor never will be without number of men in that state i have name all governors of independent communities whether they be or be not in league with others for it be not every compact that put an end to the state of nature between men but only this one of agree together mutually to enter into one community and make one body politic other promise and compact men may make one with another and yet still be in the state of nature the promise and bargain for truck etc between the two men in soldania in or between a swiss and an indian in the woods of america be bind to them though they be perfectly in a state of nature in reference to one another for truth and keep of faith belong to men as men and not as members of society to those that say there be never any men in the state of nature i will not oppose the authority of the judicious hooker eccl pol i where he say the laws which have be hitherto mention ie the laws of naturedo bind men absolutely even as they be men although they have never any settle fellowship never any solemn agreement amongst themselves what to do or not to do but for as much as we be not by ourselves sufficient to furnish ourselves with competent store of things needful for such a life as our nature doth desire a life fit for the dignity of man therefore to supply those defect and imperfections which be in us as live single and solely by ourselves we be naturally induce to seek communion and fellowship with others this be the cause of men unite themselves as first in politic societies but i moreover affirm that all men be naturally in that state and remain so till by their own consent they make themselves members of some politic society and i doubt not in the sequel of this discourse to make it very clear of the state of war the state of war be a state of enmity and destruction and therefore declare by word or action not a passionate and hasty but sedate settle design upon another man life put him in a state of war with him against whom he have declare such an intention and so have expose his life to the others power to be take away by him or any one that join with him in his defence and espouse his quarrel it be reasonable and just i should have a right to destroy that which threaten me with destruction for by the fundamental law of nature man be to be preserve as much as possible when all can not be preserve the safety of the innocent be to be prefer and one may destroy a man who make war upon him or have discover an enmity to his be for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion because they be not under the tie of the common law of reason have no other rule but that of force and violence and so may be treat as a beast of prey those dangerous and noxious creatures that will be sure to destroy him whenever he fall into their power and hence it be that he who attempt to get another man into his absolute power do thereby put himself into a state of war with him it be to be understand as a declaration of a design upon his life for i have reason to conclude that he who would get me into his power without my consent would use me as he please when he have get me there and destroy me too when he have a fancy to it for nobody can desire to have me in his absolute power unless it be to compel me by force to that which be against the right of my freedomie make me a slave to be free from such force be the only security of my preservation and reason bid me look on him as an enemy to my preservation who would take away that freedom which be the fence to it so that he who make an attempt to enslave me thereby put himself into a state of war with me he that in the state of nature would take away the freedom that belong to any one in that state must necessarily be suppose to have a design to take away everything else that freedom be the foundation of all the rest as he that in the state of society would take away the freedom belong to those of that society or commonwealth must be suppose to design to take away from them everything else and so be look on as in a state of war this make it lawful for a man to kill a thief who have not in the least hurt him nor declare any design upon his life any farther than by the use of force so to get him in his power as to take away his money or what he please from him because use force where he have no right to get me into his power let his pretence be what it will i have no reason to suppose that he who would take away my liberty would not when he have me in his power take away everything else and therefore it be lawful for me to treat him as one who have put himself into a state of war with meie kill him if i can for to that hazard do he justly expose himself whoever introduce a state of war and be aggressor in it and here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war which however some men have confound be as far distant as a state of peace goodwill mutual assistance and preservation and a state of enmity malice violence and mutual destruction be one from another men live together accord to reason without a common superior on earth with authority to judge between them be properly the state of nature but force or a declare design of force upon the person of another where there be no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief be the state of war and it be the want of such an appeal give a man the right of war even against an aggressor though he be in society and a fellowsubject thus a thief whom i can not harm but by appeal to the law for have steal all that i be worth i may kill when he set on me to rob me but of my horse or coat because the law which be make for my preservation where it can not interpose to secure my life from present force which if lose be capable of no reparation permit me my own defence and the right of war a liberty to kill the aggressor because the aggressor allow not time to appeal to our common judge nor the decision of the law for remedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable want of a common judge with authority put all men in a state of nature force without right upon a man person make a state of war both where there be and be not a common judge but when the actual force be over the state of war cease between those that be in society and be equally on both side subject to the judge and therefore in such controversies where the question be put who shall be judge it can not be mean who shall decide the controversy every one know what jephtha here tell us that the lord the judge shall judge where there be no judge on earth the appeal lie to god in heaven that question then can not mean who shall judge whether another hath put himself in a state of war with me and whether i may as jephtha do appeal to heaven in it of that i myself can only judge in my own conscience as i will answer it at the great day to the supreme judge of all men of slavery the natural liberty of man be to be free from any superior power on earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man but to have only the law of nature for his rule the liberty of man in society be to be under no other legislative power but that establish by consent in the commonwealth nor under the dominion of any will or restraint of any law but what that legislative shall enact accord to the trust put in it freedom then be not what sir robert filmer tell us a liberty for every one to do what he list to live as he please and not to be tie by any laws but freedom of men under government be to have a stand rule to live by common to every one of that society and make by the legislative power erect in it a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribe not not to be subject to the inconstant uncertain unknown arbitrary will of another man as freedom of nature be to be under no other restraint but the law of nature this freedom from absolute arbitrary power be so necessary to and closely join with a man preservation that he can not part with it but by what forfeit his preservation and life together for a man not have the power of his own life can not by compact or his own consent enslave himself to any one nor put himself under the absolute arbitrary power of another to take away his life when he please nobody can give more power than he have himself and he that can not take away his own life can not give another power over it indeed have by his fault forfeit his own life by some act that deserve death he to whom he have forfeit it may when he have him in his power delay to take it and make use of him to his own service and he do him no injury by it for whenever he find the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life it be in his power by resist the will of his master to draw on himself the death he desire this be the perfect condition of slavery which be nothing else but the state of war continue between a lawful conqueror and a captive for if once compact enter between them and make an agreement for a limit power on the one side and obedience on the other the state of war and slavery cease as long as the compact endure for as have be say no man can by agreement pass over to another that which he hath not in himselfa power over his own life i confess we find among the jews as well as other nations that men do sell themselves but it be plain this be only to drudgery not to slavery for it be evident the person sell be not under an absolute arbitrary despotical power for the master could not have power to kill him at any time whom at a certain time he be oblige to let go free out of his service and the master of such a servant be so far from have an arbitrary power over his life that he could not at pleasure so much as maim him but the loss of an eye or tooth set him free exod of property whether we consider natural reason which tell us that men be once bear have a right to their preservation and consequently to meat and drink and such other things as nature afford for their subsistence or revelation which give us an account of those grant god make of the world to adam and to noah and his sons it be very clear that god as king david say psalm have give the earth to the children of men give it to mankind in common but this be suppose it seem to some a very great difficulty how any one should ever come to have a property in anything i will not content myself to answer that if it be difficult to make out property upon a supposition that god give the world to adam and his posterity in common it be impossible that any man but one universal monarch should have any property upon a supposition that god give the world to adam and his heirs in succession exclusive of all the rest of his posterity but i shall endeavour to show how men might come to have a property in several part of that which god give to mankind in common and that without any express compact of all the commoners god who hath give the world to men in common hath also give them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life and convenience the earth and all that be therein be give to men for the support and comfort of their be and though all the fruit it naturally produce and beasts it feed belong to mankind in common as they be produce by the spontaneous hand of nature and nobody have originally a private dominion exclusive of the rest of mankind in any of them as they be thus in their natural state yet be give for the use of men there must of necessity be a mean to appropriate them some way or other before they can be of any use or at all beneficial to any particular men the fruit or venison which nourish the wild indian who know no enclosure and be still a tenant in common must be his and so his ie a part of him that another can no longer have any right to it before it can do him any good for the support of his life though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men yet every man have a property in his own person this nobody have any right to but himself the labour of his body and the work of his hand we may say be properly his whatsoever then he remove out of the state that nature hath provide and leave it in he hath mix his labour with it and join to it something that be his own and thereby make it his property it be by him remove from the common state nature place it in it hath by this labour something annex to it that exclude the common right of other men for this labour be the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can have a right to what that be once join to at least where there be enough and as good leave in common for others he that be nourish by the acorns he pick up under an oak or the apples he gather from the tree in the wood have certainly appropriate them to himself nobody can deny but the nourishment be his i ask then when do they begin to be his when he digest or when he eat or when he boil or when he bring them home or when he pick them up and it be plain if the first gather make them not his nothing else could that labour put a distinction between them and common that add something to them more than nature the common mother of all have do and so they become his private right and will any one say he have no right to those acorns or apples he thus appropriate because he have not the consent of all mankind to make them his be it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belong to all in common if such a consent as that be necessary man have starve notwithstanding the plenty god have give him we see in commons which remain so by compact that it be the take any part of what be common and remove it out of the state nature leave it in which begin the property without which the common be of no use and the take of this or that part do not depend on the express consent of all the commoners thus the grass my horse have bite the turf my servant have cut and the ore i have digged in any place where i have a right to them in common with others become my property without the assignation or consent of anybody the labour that be mine remove them out of that common state they be in hath fix my property in them by make an explicit consent of every commoner necessary to any ones appropriate to himself any part of what be give in common children or servants could not cut the meat which their father or master have provide for them in common without assign to every one his peculiar part though the water run in the fountain be every ones yet who can doubt but that in the pitcher be his only who draw it out his labour hath take it out of the hand of nature where it be common and belong equally to all her children and hath thereby appropriate it to himself thus this law of reason make the deer that indians who hath kill it it be allow to be his goods who hath bestow his labour upon it though before it be the common right of every one and amongst those who be count the civilise part of mankind who have make and multiply positive laws to determine property this original law of nature for the begin of property in what be before common still take place and by virtue thereof what fish any one catch in the ocean that great and still remain common of mankind or what ambergris any one take up here be by the labour that remove it out of that common state nature leave it in make his property who take that pain about it and even amongst us the hare that any one be hunt be think his who pursue her during the chase for be a beast that be still look upon as common and no man private possession whoever have employ so much labour about any of that kind as to find and pursue her have thereby remove her from the state of nature wherein she be common and hath begin a property it will perhaps be object to this that if gather the acorns or other fruit of the earth etc make a right to them then any one may engross as much as he will to which i answer not so the same law of nature that do by this mean give us property do also bind that property too god have give us all things richly be the voice of reason confirm by inspiration but how far have he give it usto enjoy as much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoil so much he may by his labour fix a property in whatever be beyond this be more than his share and belong to others nothing be make by god for man to spoil or destroy and thus consider the plenty of natural provision there be a long time in the world and the few spenders and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one man could extend itself and engross it to the prejudice of others especially keep within the bound set by reason of what might serve for his use there could be then little room for quarrel or contentions about property so establish but the chief matter of property be now not the fruit of the earth and the beasts that subsist on it but the earth itself as that which take in and carry with it all the rest i think it be plain that property in that too be acquire as the former as much land as a man till plant improve cultivate and can use the product of so much be his property he by his labour do as it be enclose it from the common nor will it invalidate his right to say everybody else have an equal title to it and therefore he can not appropriate he can not enclose without the consent of all his fellowcommoners all mankind god when he give the world in common to all mankind command man also to labour and the penury of his condition require it of him god and his reason command him to subdue the earthie improve it for the benefit of life and therein lay out something upon it that be his own his labour he that in obedience to this command of god subdue till and sow any part of it thereby annex to it something that be his property which another have no title to nor could without injury take from him nor be this appropriation of any parcel of land by improve it any prejudice to any other man since there be still enough and as good leave and more than the yet unprovided could use so that in effect there be never the less leave for others because of his enclosure for himself for he that leave as much as another can make use of do as good as take nothing at all nobody could think himself injure by the drink of another man though he take a good draught who have a whole river of the same water leave him to quench his thirst and the case of land and water where there be enough of both be perfectly the same god give the world to men in common but since he give it them for their benefit and the greatest conveniencies of life they be capable to draw from it it can not be suppose he mean it should always remain common and uncultivated he give it to the use of the industrious and rational and labour be to be his title to it not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious he that have as good leave for his improvement as be already take up need not complain ought not to meddle with what be already improve by anothers labour if he do it be plain he desire the benefit of anothers pain which he have no right to and not the grind which god have give him in common with others to labour on and whereof there be as good leave as that already possess and more than he know what to do with or his industry could reach to it be true in land that be common in england or any other country where there be plenty of people under government who have money and commerce no one can enclose or appropriate any part without the consent of all his fellowcommoners because this be leave common by compactie by the law of the land which be not to be violate and though it be common in respect of some men it be not so to all mankind but be the joint propriety of this country or this parish besides the remainder after such enclosure would not be as good to the rest of the commoners as the whole be when they could all make use of the whole whereas in the begin and first people of the great common of the world it be quite otherwise the law man be under be rather for appropriate god command and his want force him to labour that be his property which could not be take from him wherever he have fix it and hence subdue or cultivate the earth and have dominion we see be join together the one give title to the other so that god by command to subdue give authority so far to appropriate and the condition of human life which require labour and materials to work on necessarily introduce private possessions the measure of property nature well set by the extent of mens labour and the conveniency of life no man labour could subdue or appropriate all nor could his enjoyment consume more than a small part so that it be impossible for any man this way to entrench upon the right of another or acquire to himself a property to the prejudice of his neighbour who would still have room for as good and as large a possession after the other have take out his as before it be appropriate which measure do confine every man possession to a very moderate proportion and such as he might appropriate to himself without injury to anybody in the first age of the world when men be more in danger to be lose by wander from their company in the then vast wilderness of the earth than to be straiten for want of room to plant in the same measure may be allow still without prejudice to anybody full as the world seem for suppose a man or family in the state they be at first people of the world by the children of adam or noah let him plant in some inland vacant place of america we shall find that the possessions he could make himself upon the measure we have give would not be very large nor even to this day prejudice the rest of mankind or give them reason to complain or think themselves injure by this man encroachment though the race of men have now spread themselves to all the corner of the world and do infinitely exceed the small number be at the begin nay the extent of grind be of so little value without labour that i have hear it affirm that in spain itself a man may be permit to plough sow and reap without be disturb upon land he have no other title to but only his make use of it but on the contrary the inhabitants think themselves behold to him who by his industry on neglect and consequently waste land have increase the stock of corn which they want but be this as it will which i lay no stress on this i dare boldly affirm that the same rule of proprietyviz that every man should have as much as he could make use of would hold still in the world without straiten anybody since there be land enough in the world to suffice double the inhabitants have not the invention of money and the tacit agreement of men to put a value on it introduce by consent larger possessions and a right to them which how it have do i shall by and by show more at large this be certain that in the begin before the desire of have more than men need have alter the intrinsic value of things which depend only on their usefulness to the life of man or have agree that a little piece of yellow metal which would keep without waste or decay should be worth a great piece of flesh or a whole heap of corn though men have a right to appropriate by their labour each one to himself as much of the things of nature as he could use yet this could not be much nor to the prejudice of others where the same plenty be still leave to those who would use the same industry before the appropriation of land he who gather as much of the wild fruit kill catch or tame as many of the beasts as he could he that so employ his pain about any of the spontaneous products of nature as any way to alter them from the state nature put them in by place any of his labour on them do thereby acquire a propriety in them but if they perish in his possession without their due useif the fruit rot or the venison putrefy before he could spend it he offend against the common law of nature and be liable to be punish he invade his neighbour share for he have no right farther than his use call for any of them and they might serve to afford him conveniencies of life the same measure govern the possession of land too whatsoever he till and reap lay up and make use of before it spoil that be his peculiar right whatsoever he enclose and could fee and make use of the cattle and product be also his but if either the grass of his enclosure rot on the grind or the fruit of his plant perish without gather and lay up this part of the earth notwithstanding his enclosure be still to be look on as waste and might be the possession of any other thus at the begin cain might take as much grind as he could till and make it his own land and yet leave enough to abels sheep to fee on a few acres would serve for both their possessions but as families increase and industry enlarge their stock their possessions enlarge with the need of them but yet it be commonly without any fix property in the grind they make use of till they incorporate settle themselves together and build cities and then by consent they come in time to set out the bound of their distinct territories and agree on limit between them and their neighbour and by laws within themselves settle the properties of those of the same society for we see that in that part of the world which be first inhabit and therefore like to be best people even as low down as abrahams time they wander with their flock and their herd which be their substance freely up and downand this abraham do in a country where he be a stranger whence it be plain that at least a great part of the land lay in common that the inhabitants value it not nor claim property in any more than they make use of but when there be not room enough in the same place for their herd to fee together they by consent as abraham and lot do gen xiii separate and enlarge their pasture where it best like them and for the same reason esau go from his father and his brother and plant in mount seir gen and thus without suppose any private dominion and property in adam over all the world exclusive of all other men which can no way be prove nor any ones property be make out from it but suppose the world give as it be to the children of men in common we see how labour could make men distinct title to several parcel of it for their private use wherein there could be no doubt of right no room for quarrel nor be it so strange as perhaps before consideration it may appear that the property of labour should be able to overbalance the community of land for it be labour indeed that put the difference of value on everything and let any one consider what the difference be between an acre of land plant with tobacco or sugar sow with wheat or barley and an acre of the same land lie in common without any husbandry upon it and he will find that the improvement of labour make the far greater part of the value i think it will be but a very modest computation to say that of the products of the earth useful to the life of man ninetenths be the effect of labour nay if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use and cast up the several expense about themwhat in them be purely owe to nature and what to labourwe shall find that in most of them ninetynine hundredths be wholly to be put on the account of labour there can not be a clearer demonstration of anything than several nations of the americans be of this who be rich in land and poor in all the comfort of life whom nature have furnish as liberally as any other people with the materials of plentyie a fruitful soil apt to produce in abundance what might serve for food raiment and delight yet for want of improve it by labour have not one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy and a king of a large and fruitful territory there feed lodge and be clothe worse than a day labourer in england to make this a little clearer let us but trace some of the ordinary provision of life through their several progress before they come to our use and see how much they receive of their value from human industry bread wine and cloth be things of daily use and great plenty yet notwithstanding acorns water and leave or skin must be our bread drink and clothe do not labour furnish us with these more useful commodities for whatever bread be more worth than acorns wine than water and cloth or silk than leave skin or moss that be wholly owe to labour and industry the one of these be the food and raiment which unassisted nature furnish us with the other provision which our industry and pain prepare for us which how much they exceed the other in value when any one hath compute he will then see how much labour make the far greatest part of the value of things we enjoy in this world and the grind which produce the materials be scarce to be reckon in as any or at most but a very small part of it so little that even amongst us land that be leave wholly to nature that hath no improvement of pasturage tillage or plant be call as indeed it be waste and we shall find the benefit of it amount to little more than nothing an acre of land that bear here twenty bushel of wheat and another in america which with the same husbandry would do the like be without doubt of the same natural intrinsic value but yet the benefit mankind receive from one in a year be worth five pound and the other possibly not worth a penny if all the profit an indian receive from it be to be value and sell here at least i may truly say not one thousandth it be labour then which put the greatest part of value upon land without which it would scarcely be worth anything it be to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful products for all that the straw bran bread of that acre of wheat be more worth than the product of an acre of as good land which lie waste be all the effect of labour for it be not barely the ploughmans pain the reapers and threshers toil and the bakers sweat be to be count into the bread we eat the labour of those who break the oxen who digged and work the iron and stone who fell and frame the timber employ about the plough mill oven or any other utensils which be a vast number requisite to this corn from its sow to its be make bread must all be charge on the account of labour and receive as an effect of that nature and the earth furnish only the almost worthless materials as in themselves it would be a strange catalogue of things that industry provide and make use of about every loaf of bread before it come to our use if we could trace them iron wood leather bark timber stone bricks coal lime cloth dyeingdrugs pitch tar masts rope and all the materials make use of in the ship that bring any of the commodities make use of by any of the workmen to any part of the work all which it would be almost impossible at least too long to reckon up from all which it be evident that though the things of nature be give in common man by be master of himself and proprietor of his own person and the action or labour of it have still in himself the great foundation of property and that which make up the great part of what he apply to the support or comfort of his be when invention and arts have improve the conveniences of life be perfectly his own and do not belong in common to others thus labour in the begin give a right of property wherever any one be please to employ it upon what be common which remain a long while the far greater part and be yet more than mankind make use of men at first for the most part content themselves with what unassisted nature offer to their necessities and though afterwards in some part of the world where the increase of people and stock with the use of money have make land scarce and so of some value the several communities settle the bound of their distinct territories and by laws within themselves regulate the properties of the private men of their society and so by compact and agreement settle the property which labour and industry begin and the league that have be make between several state and kingdoms either expressly or tacitly disown all claim and right to the land in the others possession have by common consent give up their pretences to their natural common right which originally they have to those countries and so have by positive agreement settle a property amongst themselves in distinct part of the world yet there be still great tracts of grind to be find which the inhabitants thereof not have join with the rest of mankind in the consent of the use of their common money lie waste and be more than the people who dwell on it do or can make use of and so still lie in common though this can scarce happen amongst that part of mankind that have consent to the use of money the greatest part of things really useful to the life of man and such as the necessity of subsist make the first commoners of the world look afteras it doth the americans noware generally things of short duration such asif they be not consume by use will decay and perish of themselves gold silver and diamonds be things that fancy or agreement hath put the value on more than real use and the necessary support of life now of those good things which nature hath provide in common every one hath a right as hath be say to as much as he could use and have a property in all he could effect with his labour all that his industry could extend to to alter from the state nature have put it in be his he that gather a hundred bushel of acorns or apples have thereby a property in them they be his goods as soon as gather he be only to look that he use them before they spoil else he take more than his share and rob others and indeed it be a foolish thing as well as dishonest to hoard up more than he could make use of if he give away a part to anybody else so that it perish not uselessly in his possession these he also make use of and if he also barter away plums that would have rot in a week for nut that would last good for his eat a whole year he do no injury he waste not the common stock destroy no part of the portion of goods that belong to others so long as nothing perish uselessly in his hand again if he would give his nut for a piece of metal please with its colour or exchange his sheep for shell or wool for a sparkle pebble or a diamond and keep those by him all his life he invade not the right of others he might heap up as much of these durable things as he please the exceed of the bound of his just property not lie in the largeness of his possession but the perish of anything uselessly in it and thus come in the use of money some last thing that men might keep without spoil and that by mutual consent men would take in exchange for the truly useful but perishable support of life and as different degrees of industry be apt to give men possessions in different proportion so this invention of money give them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them for suppose an island separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world wherein there be but a hundred families but there be sheep horse and cow with other useful animals wholesome fruit and land enough for corn for a hundred thousand time as many but nothing in the island either because of its commonness or perishableness fit to supply the place of money what reason could any one have there to enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family and a plentiful supply to its consumption either in what their own industry produce or they could barter for like perishable useful commodities with others where there be not something both last and scarce and so valuable to be hoard up there men will not be apt to enlarge their possessions of land be it never so rich never so free for them to take for i ask what would a man value ten thousand or an hundred thousand acres of excellent land ready cultivate and well stock too with cattle in the middle of the inland part of america where he have no hop of commerce with other part of the world to draw money to him by the sale of the product it would not be worth the enclose and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature whatever be more than would supply the conveniences of life to be have there for him and his family thus in the begin all the world be america and more so than that be now for no such thing as money be anywhere know find out something that hath the use and value of money amongst his neighbour you shall see the same man will begin presently to enlarge his possessions but since gold and silver be little useful to the life of man in proportion to food raiment and carriage have its value only from the consent of menwhereof labour yet make in great part the measure it be plain that the consent of men have agree to a disproportionate and unequal possession of the earthi mean out of the bound of society and compact for in governments the laws regulate it they have by consent find out and agree in a way how a man may rightfully and without injury possess more than he himself can make use of by receive gold and silver which may continue long in a man possession without decay for the overplus and agree those metal should have a value and thus i think it be very easy to conceive without any difficulty how labour could at first begin a title of property in the common things of nature and how the spend it upon our use bound it so that there could then be no reason of quarrel about title nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it give right and conveniency go together for as a man have a right to all he could employ his labour upon so he have no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of this leave no room for controversy about the title nor for encroachment on the right of others what portion a man carve to himself be easily see and it be useless as well as dishonest to carve himself too much or take more than he need i of paternal power it may perhaps be censure an impertinent criticism in a discourse of this nature to find fault with word and name that have obtain in the world and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new ones when the old be apt to lead men into mistake as this of paternal power probably have do which seem so to place the power of parent over their children wholly in the father as if the mother have no share in it whereas if we consult reason or revelation we shall find she have an equal title which may give one reason to ask whether this might not be more properly call parental power for whatever obligation nature and the right of generation lay on children it must certainly bind them equal to both the concurrent cause of it and accordingly we see the positive law of god everywhere join them together without distinction when it command the obedience of children honour thy father and thy mother exod whosoever curseth his father or his mother lev ye shall fear every man his mother and his father lev children obey your parent eph etc be the style of the old and new testament have but this one thing be well consider without look any deeper into the matter it might perhaps have keep men from run into those gross mistake they have make about this power of parent which however it might without any great harshness bear the name of absolute dominion and regal authority when under the title of paternal power it seem appropriate to the father would yet have sound but oddly and in the very name show the absurdity if this suppose absolute power over children have be call parental and thereby discover that it belong to the mother too for it will but very ill serve the turn of those men who contend so much for the absolute power and authority of the fatherhood as they call it that the mother should have any share in it and it would have but ill support the monarchy they contend for when by the very name it appear that that fundamental authority from whence they would derive their government of a single person only be not place in one but two persons jointly but to let this of name pass though i have say above that all men by nature be equal i can not be suppose to understand all sort of equality age or virtue may give men a just precedency excellency of part and merit may place others above the common level birth may subject some and alliance or benefit others to pay an observance to those to whom nature gratitude or other respect may have make it due and yet all this consist with the equality which all men be in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another which be the equality i there speak of as proper to the business in hand be that equal right that every man hath to his natural freedom without be subject to the will or authority of any other man children i confess be not bear in this full state of equality though they be bear to it their parent have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it be but a temporary one the bond of this subjection be like the swaddle clothe they be wrapt up in and support by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a man at his own free disposal adam be create a perfect man his body and mind in full possession of their strength and reason and so be capable from the first instance of his be to provide for his own support and preservation and govern his action accord to the dictate of the law of reason god have implant in him from him the world be people with his descendants who be all bear infants weak and helpless without knowledge or understand but to supply the defect of this imperfect state till the improvement of growth and age have remove them adam and eve and after them all parent be by the law of nature under an obligation to preserve nourish and educate the children they have beget not as their own workmanship but the workmanship of their own maker the almighty to whom they be to be accountable for them the law that be to govern adam be the same that be to govern all his posterity the law of reason but his offspring have another way of entrance into the world different from him by a natural birth that produce them ignorant and without the use of reason they be not presently under that law for nobody can be under a law that be not promulgate to him and this law be promulgate or make know by reason only he that be not come to the use of his reason can not be say to be under this law and adams children be not presently as soon as bear under this law of reason be not presently free for law in its true notion be not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper interest and prescribe no farther than be for the general good of those under that law could they be happier without it the law as a useless thing would of itself vanish and that ill deserve the name of confinement which hedge us in only from bog and precipices so that however it may be mistake the end of law be not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the state of create be capable of laws where there be no law there be no freedom for liberty be to be free from restraint and violence from others which can not be where there be no law and be not as we be tell a liberty for every man to do what he list for who could be free when every other man humour might domineer over him but a liberty to dispose and order freely as he list his person action possessions and his whole property within the allowance of those laws under which he be and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another but freely follow his own the power then that parent have over their children arise from that duty which be incumbent on them to take care of their offspring during the imperfect state of childhood to inform the mind and govern the action of their yet ignorant nonage till reason shall take its place and ease them of that trouble be what the children want and the parent be bind to for god have give man an understand to direct his action have allow him a freedom of will and liberty of act as properly belong thereunto within the bound of that law he be under but whilst he be in an estate wherein he have no understand of his own to direct his will he be not to have any will of his own to follow he that understand for him must will for him too he must prescribe to his will and regulate his action but when he come to the estate that make his father a free man the son be a free man too this hold in all the laws a man be under whether natural or civil be a man under the law of nature what make him free of that law what give him a free dispose of his property accord to his own will within the compass of that law i answer an estate wherein he might be suppose capable to know that law that so he might keep his action within the bound of it when he have acquire that state he be presume to know how far that law be to be his guide and how far he may make use of his freedom and so come to have it till then somebody else must guide him who be presume to know how far the law allow a liberty if such a state of reason such an age of discretion make him free the same shall make his son free too be a man under the law of england what make him free of that lawthat be to have the liberty to dispose of his action and possessions accord to his own will within the permission of that law a capacity of know that law which be suppose by that law at the age of twentyone and in some case sooner if this make the father free it shall make the son free too till then we see the law allow the son to have no will but he be to be guide by the will of his father or guardian who be to understand for him and if the father die and fail to substitute a deputy in this trust if he hath not provide a tutor to govern his son during his minority during his want of understand the law take care to do it some other must govern him and be a will to him till he hath attain to a state of freedom and his understand be fit to take the government of his will but after that the father and son be equally free as much as tutor and pupil after nonage equally subject of the same law together without any dominion leave in the father over the life liberty or estate of his son whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature or under the positive laws of an establish government but if through defect that may happen out of the ordinary course of nature any one come not to such a degree of reason wherein he might be suppose capable of know the law and so live within the rule of it he be never capable of be a free man he be never let loose to the disposure of his own will because he know no bound to it have not understand its proper guide but be continue under the tuition and government of others all the time his own understand be inca pable of that charge and so lunatics and idiots be never set free from the government of their parent children who be not as yet come unto those years whereat they may have and innocents which be exclude by a natural defect from ever have thirdly madmen which for the present can not possibly have the use of right reason to guide themselves have for their guide the reason that guideth other men which be tutor over them to seek and procure their good for them say hooker eccl pol lib i s all which seem no more than that duty which god and nature have lay on man as well as other creatures to preserve their offspring till they can be able to shift for themselves and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of parent regal authority thus we be bear free as we be bear rational not that we have actually the exercise of either age that bring one bring with it the other too and thus we see how natural freedom and subjection to parent may consist together and be both found on the same principle a child be free by his father title by his father understand which be to govern him till he hath it of his own the freedom of a man at years of discretion and the subjection of a child to his parent whilst yet short of it be so consistent and so distinguishable that the most blind contenders for monarchy by right of fatherhood can not miss of it the most obstinate can not but allow of it for be their doctrine all true be the right heir of adam now know and by that title settle a monarch in his throne invest with all the absolute unlimited power sir robert filmer talk of if he should die as soon as his heir be bear must not the child notwithstanding he be never so free never so much sovereign be in subjection to his mother and nurse to tutor and governors till age and education bring him reason and ability to govern himself and others the necessities of his life the health of his body and the information of his mind would require him to be direct by the will of others and not his own and yet will any one think that this restraint and subjection be inconsistent with or spoil him of that liberty or sovereignty he have a right to or give away his empire to those who have the government of his nonage this government over him only prepare him the better and sooner for it if anybody should ask me when my son be of age to be free i shall answer just when his monarch be of age to govern but at what time say the judicious hooker eccl pol lib i s a man may be say to have attain so far forth the use of reason as sufficeth to make him capable of those laws whereby he be then bind to guide his action this be a great deal more easy for sense to discern than for any one by skill and learn to determine commonwealths themselves take notice of and allow that there be a time when men be to begin to act like free men and therefore till that time require not oaths of fealty or allegiance or other public own of or submission to the government of their countries the freedom then of man and liberty of act accord to his own will be ground on his have reason which be able to instruct him in that law he be to govern himself by and make him know how far he be leave to the freedom of his own will to turn him loose to an unrestrained liberty before he have reason to guide him be not the allow him the privilege of his nature to be free but to thrust him out amongst brutes and abandon him to a state as wretched and as much beneath that of a man as theirs this be that which put the authority into the parent hand to govern the minority of their children god hath make it their business to employ this care on their offspring and hath place in them suitable inclinations of tenderness and concern to temper this power to apply it as his wisdom design it to the childrens good as long as they should need to be under it but what reason can hence advance this care of the parent due to their offspring into an absolute arbitrary dominion of the father whose power reach no farther than by such a discipline as he find most effectual to give such strength and health to their body such vigour and rectitude to their mind as may best fit his children to be most useful to themselves and others and if it be necessary to his condition to make them work when they be able for their own subsistence but in this power the mother too have her share with the father nay this power so little belong to the father by any peculiar right of nature but only as he be guardian of his children that when he quit his care of them he lose his power over them which go along with their nourishment and education to which it be inseparably annex and belong as much to the fosterfather of an expose child as to the natural father of another so little power do the bare act of beget give a man over his issue if all his care end there and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority of a father and what will become of this paternal power in that part of the world where one woman hath more than one husband at a time or in those part of america where when the husband and wife part which happen frequently the children be all leave to the mother follow her and be wholly under her care and provision and if the father die whilst the children be young do they not naturally everywhere owe the same obedience to their mother during their minority as to their father be he alive and will any one say that the mother hath a legislative power over her children that she can make stand rule which shall be of perpetual obligation by which they ought to regulate all the concern of their property and bind their liberty all the course of their live and enforce the observation of them with capital punishments for this be the proper power of the magistrate of which the father hath not so much as the shadow his command over his children be but temporary and reach not their life or property it be but a help to the weakness and imperfection of their nonage a discipline necessary to their education and though a father may dispose of his own possessions as he please when his children be out of danger of perish for want yet his power extend not to the live or goods which either their own industry or anothers bounty have make theirs nor to their liberty neither when they be once arrive to the enfranchisement of the years of discretion the father empire then cease and he can from thenceforward no more dispose of the liberty of his son than that of any other man and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdiction from which a man may withdraw himself have licence from divine authority to leave father and mother and cleave to his wife but though there be a time when a child come to be as free from subjection to the will and command of his father as he himself be free from subjection to the will of anybody else and they be both under no other restraint but that which be common to them both whether it be the law of nature or municipal law of their country yet this freedom exempt not a son from that honour which he ought by the law of god and nature to pay his parent god have make the parent instrument in his great design of continue the race of mankind and the occasion of life to their children as he hath lay on them an obligation to nourish preserve and bring up their offspring so he have lay on the children a perpetual obligation of honour their parent which contain in it an inward esteem and reverence to be show by all outward expressions tie up the child from anything that may ever injure or affront disturb or endanger the happiness or life of those from whom he receive his and engage him in all action of defence relief assistance and comfort of those by whose mean he enter into be and have be make capable of any enjoyments of life from this obligation no state no freedom can absolve children but this be very far from give parent a power of command over their children or an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their live or liberties it be one thing to owe honour respect gratitude and assistance another to require an absolute obedience and submission the honour due to parent a monarch on his throne owe his mother and yet this lessen not his authority nor subject him to her government the subjection of a minor place in the father a temporary government which terminate with the minority of the child and the honour due from a child place in the parent a perpetual right to respect reverence support and compliance to more or less as the father care cost and kindness in his education have be more or less and this end not with minority but hold in all part and condition of a man life the want of distinguish these two power which the father hath in the right of tuition during minority and the right of honour all his life may perhaps have cause a great part of the mistake about this matter for to speak properly of them the first of these be rather the privilege of children and duty of parent than any prerogative of paternal power the nourishment and education of their children be a charge so incumbent on parent for their childrens good that nothing can absolve them from take care of it and though the power of command and chastise them go along with it yet god hath weave into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for their offspring that there be little fear that parent should use their power with too much rigour the excess be seldom on the severe side the strong bias of nature draw the other way and therefore god almighty when he would express his gentle deal with the israelites he tell them that though he chasten them he chasten them as a man chasten his son deut ie with tenderness and affection and keep them under no severer discipline than what be absolutely best for them and have be less kindness to have slacken this be that power to which children be command obedience that the pain and care of their parent may not be increase or illrewarded on the other side honour and support all that which gratitude require to return for the benefit receive by and from them be the indispensable duty of the child and the proper privilege of the parent this be intend for the parent advantage as the other be for the childs though education the parent duty seem to have most power because the ignorance and infirmities of childhood stand in need of restraint and correction which be a visible exercise of rule and a kind of dominion and that duty which be comprehend in the word honour require less obedience though the obligation be stronger on grow than younger children for who can think the command children obey your parent require in a man that have children of his own the same submission to his father as it do in his yet young children to him and that by this precept he be bind to obey all his father command if out of a conceit of authority he should have the indiscretion to treat him still as a boy the first part then of paternal power or rather duty which be education belong so to the father that it terminate at a certain season when the business of education be over it cease of itself and be also alienable before for a man may put the tuition of his son in other hand and he that have make his son an apprentice to another have discharge him during that time of a great part of his obedience both to himself and to his mother but all the duty of honour the other part remain nevertheless entire to them nothing can cancel that it be so inseparable from them both that the father authority can not dispossess the mother of this right nor can any man discharge his son from honour her that bore him but both these be very far from a power to make laws and enforce them with penalties that may reach estate liberty limbs and life the power of command end with nonage and though after that honour and respect support and defence and whatsoever gratitude can oblige a man to for the highest benefit he be naturally capable of be always due from a son to his parent yet all this put no sceptre into the father hand no sovereign power of command he have no dominion over his sons property or action nor any right that his will should prescribe to his sons in all things however it may become his son in many things not very inconvenient to him and his family to pay a deference to it a man may owe honour and respect to an ancient or wise man defence to his child or friend relief and support to the distress and gratitude to a benefactor to such a degree that all he have all he can do can not sufficiently pay it but all these give no authority no right of make laws to any one over him from whom they be owe and it be plain all this be due not to the bare title of father not only because as have be say it be owe to the mother too but because these obligations to parent and the degrees of what be require of children may be vary by the different care and kindness trouble and expense be often employ upon one child more than another this show the reason how it come to pass that parent in societies where they themselves be subject retain a power over their children and have as much right to their subjection as those who be in the state of nature which could not possibly be if all political power be only paternal and that in truth they be one and the same thing for then all paternal power be in the prince the subject could naturally have none of it but these two power political and paternal be so perfectly distinct and separate and build upon so different foundations and give to so different end that every subject that be a father have as much a paternal power over his children as the prince have over his and every prince that have parent owe them as much filial duty and obedience as the meanest of his subject do to theirs and can therefore contain not any part or degree of that kind of dominion which a prince or magistrate have over his subject though the obligation on the parent to bring up their children and the obligation on children to honour their parent contain all the power on the one hand and submission on the other which be proper to this relation yet there be another power ordinarily in the father whereby he have a tie on the obedience of his children which though it be common to him with other men yet the occasion of show it almost constantly happen to father in their private families and in instance of it elsewhere be rare and less take notice of it pass in the world for a part of paternal jurisdiction and this be the power men generally have to bestow their estates on those who please them best the possession of the father be the expectation and inheritance of the children ordinarily in certain proportion accord to the law and custom of each country yet it be commonly in the father power to bestow it with a more spar or liberal hand accord as the behaviour of this or that child hath comport with his will and humour this be no small tie to the obedience of children and there be always annex to the enjoyment of land a submission to the government of the country of which that land be a part it have be commonly suppose that a father could oblige his posterity to that government of which he himself be a subject that his compact hold them whereas it be only a necessary condition annex to the land which be under that government reach only those who will take it on that condition and so be no natural tie or engagement but a voluntary submission for every man children be by nature as free as himself or any of his ancestors ever be may whilst they be in that freedom choose what society they will join themselves to what commonwealth they will put themselves under but if they will enjoy the inheritance of their ancestors they must take it on the same term their ancestors have it and submit to all the condition annex to such a possession by this power indeed father oblige their children to obedience to themselves even when they be past minority and most commonly too subject them to this or that political power but neither of these by any peculiar right of fatherhood but by the reward they have in their hand to enforce and recompense such a compliance and be no more power than what a frenchman have over an englishman who by the hop of an estate he will leave him will certainly have a strong tie on his obedience and if when it be leave him he will enjoy it he must certainly take it upon the condition annex to the possession of land in that country where it lie whether it be france or england to conclude then though the father power of command extend no farther than the minority of his children and to a degree only fit for the discipline and government of that age and though that honour and respect and all that which the latins call piety which they indispensably owe to their parent all their lifetime and in all estates with all that support and defence be due to them give the father no power of governingie make laws and exact penalties on his children though by this he have no dominion over the property or action of his son yet it be obvious to conceive how easy it be in the first age of the world and in place still where the thinness of people give families leave to separate into unpossessed quarter and they have room to remove and plant themselves in yet vacant habitations for the father of the family to become the prince of it he have be a ruler from the begin of the infancy of his children and when they be grow up since without some government it would be hard for them to live together it be likeliest it should by the express or tacit consent of the children be in the father where it seem without any change barely to continue and when indeed nothing more be require to it than the permit the father to exercise alone in his family that executive power of the law of nature which every free man naturally hath and by that permission resign up to him a monarchical power whilst they remain in it but that this be not by any paternal right but only by the consent of his children be evident from hence that nobody doubt but if a stranger whom chance or business have bring to his family have there kill any of his children or commit any other act he might condemn and put him to death or otherwise have punish him as well as any of his children which be impossible he should do by virtue of any paternal authority over one who be not his child but by virtue of that executive power of the law of nature which as a man he have a right to and he alone could punish him in his family where the respect of his children have lay by the exercise of such a power to give way to the dignity and authority they be will should remain in him above the rest of his family thus it be easy and almost natural for children by a tacit and almost natural consent to make way for the father authority and government they have be accustom in their childhood to follow his direction and to refer their little differences to him and when they be men who be fitter to rule them their little properties and less covetousness seldom afford greater controversies and when any should arise where could they have a fitter umpire than he by whose care they have every one be sustain and bring up and who have a tenderness for them all it be no wonder that they make no distinction betwixt minority and full age nor look after oneandtwenty or any other age that might make them the free disposers of themselves and fortunes when they could have no desire to be out of their pupilage the government they have be under during it continue still to be more their protection than restraint and they could nowhere find a greater security to their peace liberties and fortunes than in the rule of a father thus the natural father of families by an insensible change become the politic monarchs of them too and as they chance to live long and leave able and worthy heirs for several successions or otherwise so they lay the foundations of hereditary or elective kingdoms under several constitutions and manors accord as chance contrivance or occasion happen to mould them but if princes have their title in the father right and it be a sufficient proof of the natural right of father to political authority because they commonly be those in whose hand we find de facto the exercise of government i say if this argument be good it will as strongly prove that all princes nay princes only ought to be priests since it be as certain that in the begin the father of the family be priest as that he be ruler in his own household ii of political or civil society god have make man such a creature that in his own judgment it be not good for him to be alone put him under strong obligations of necessity convenience and inclination to drive him into society as well as fit him with understand and language to continue and enjoy it the first society be between man and wife which give begin to that between parent and children to which in time that between master and servant come to be add and though all these might and commonly do meet together and make up but one family wherein the master or mistress of it have some sort of rule proper to a family each of these or all together come short of political society as we shall see if we consider the different end tie and bound of each of these conjugal society be make by a voluntary compact between man and woman and though it consist chiefly in such a communion and right in one anothers body as be necessary to its chief end procreation yet it draw with it mutual support and assistance and a communion of interest too as necessary not only to unite their care and affection but also necessary to their common offspring who have a right to be nourish and maintain by them till they be able to provide for themselves for the end of conjunction between male and female be not barely procreation but the continuation of the species this conjunction betwixt male and female ought to last even after procreation so long as be necessary to the nourishment and support of the young ones who be to be sustain by those that get them till they be able to shift and provide for themselves this rule which the infinite wise maker hath set to the work of his hand we find the inferior creatures steadily obey in those vivaporous animals which fee on grass the conjunction between male and female last no longer than the very act of copulation because the teat of the dam be sufficient to nourish the young till it be able to fee on grass the male only beget but concern not himself for the female or young to whose sustenance he can contribute nothing but in beasts of prey the conjunction last longer because the dam not be able well to subsist herself and nourish her numerous offspring by her own prey alone a more laborious as well as more dangerous way of live than by feed on grass the assistance of the male be necessary to the maintenance of their common family which can not subsist till they be able to prey for themselves but by the joint care of male and female the same be observe in all bird except some domestic ones where plenty of food excuse the cock from feed and take care of the young brood whose young need food in the nest the cock and hen continue mat till the young be able to use their wing and provide for themselves and herein i think lie the chief if not the only reason why the male and female in mankind be tie to a longer conjunction than other creaturesviz because the female be capable of conceive and de facto be commonly with child again and bring forth too a new birth long before the former be out of a dependency for support on his parent help and able to shift for himself and have all the assistance due to him from his parent whereby the father who be bind to take care for those he hath beget be under an obligation to continue in conjugal society with the same woman longer than other creatures whose young be able to subsist of themselves before the time of procreation return again the conjugal bond dissolve of itself and they be at liberty till hymen at his usual anniversary season summon them again to choose new mat wherein one can not but admire the wisdom of the great creator who have give to man an ability to lay up for the future as well as supply the present necessity hath make it necessary that society of man and wife should be more last than of male and female amongst other creatures that so their industry might be encourage and their interest better unite to make provision and lay up goods for their common issue which uncertain mixture or easy and frequent solutions of conjugal society would mightily disturb but though these be tie upon mankind which make the conjugal bond more firm and last in a man than the other species of animals yet it would give one reason to inquire why this compact where procreation and education be secure and inheritance take care for may not be make determinable either by consent or at a certain time or upon certain condition as well as any other voluntary compact there be no necessity in the nature of the thing nor to the end of it that it should always be for lifei mean to such as be under no restraint of any positive law which ordain all such contract to be perpetual but the husband and wife though they have but one common concern yet have different understand will unavoidably sometimes have different will too it therefore be necessary that the last determination ie the rule should be place somewhere it naturally fall to the man share as the abler and the stronger but this reach but to the things of their common interest and property leave the wife in the full and true possession of what by contract be her peculiar right and at least give the husband no more power over her than she have over his life the power of the husband be so far from that of an absolute monarch that the wife have in many case a liberty to separate from him where natural right or their contract allow it whether that contract be make by themselves in the state of nature or by the customs or laws of the country they live in and the children upon such separation fall to the father or mother lot as such contract do determine for all the end of marriage be to be obtain under politic government as well as in the state of nature the civil magistrate doth not abridge the right or power of either naturally necessary to those endsviz procreation and mutual support and assistance whilst they be together but only decide any controversy that may arise between man and wife about them if it be otherwise and that absolute sovereignty and power of life and death naturally belong to the husband and be necessary to the society between man and wife there could be no matrimony in any of these countries where the husband be allow no such absolute authority but the end of matrimony require no such power in the husband it be not at all necessary to it the condition of conjugal society put it not in him but whatsoever might consist with procreation and support of the children till they could shift for themselvesmutual assistance comfort and maintenancemight be vary and regulate by that contract which first unite them in that society nothing be necessary to any society that be not necessary to the end for which it be make the society betwixt parent and children and the distinct right and power belong respectively to them i have treat of so largely in the forego chapter that i shall not here need to say anything of it and i think it be plain that it be far different from a politic society master and servant be name as old as history but give to those of far different condition for a free man make himself a servant to another by sell him for a certain time the service he undertake to do in exchange for wag he be to receive and though this commonly put him into the family of his master and under the ordinary discipline thereof yet it give the master but a temporary power over him and no greater than what be contain in the contract between them but there be another sort of servant which by a peculiar name we call slave who be captives take in a just war be by the right of nature subject to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power of their master these men have as i say forfeit their live and with it their liberties and lose their estates and be in the state of slavery not capable of any property can not in that state be consider as any part of civil society the chief end whereof be the preservation of property let us therefore consider a master of a family with all these subordinate relations of wife children servants and slave unite under the domestic rule of a family with what resemblance soever it may have in its order offices and number too with a little commonwealth yet be very far from it both in its constitution power and end or if it must be think a monarchy and the paterfamilias the absolute monarch in it absolute monarchy will have but a very shatter and short power when it be plain by what have be say before that the master of the family have a very distinct and differently limit power both as to time and extent over those several persons that be in it for except the slave and the family be as much a family and his power as paterfamilias as great whether there be any slave in his family or no he have no legislative power of life and death over any of them and none too but what a mistress of a family may have as well as he and he certainly can have no absolute power over the whole family who have but a very limit one over every individual in it but how a family or any other society of men differ from that which be properly political society we shall best see by consider wherein political society itself consist man be bear as have be prove with a title to perfect freedom and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the right and privilege of the law of nature equally with any other man or number of men in the world hath by nature a power not only to preserve his property that be his life liberty and estate against the injuries and attempt of other men but to judge of and punish the breach of that law in others as he be persuade the offence deserve even with death itself in crimes where the heinousness of the fact in his opinion require it but because no political society can be nor subsist without have in itself the power to preserve the property and in order thereunto punish the offences of all those of that society there and there only be political society where every one of the members hath quit this natural power resign it up into the hand of the community in all case that exclude him not from appeal for protection to the law establish by it and thus all private judgment of every particular member be exclude the community come to be umpire and by understand indifferent rule and men authorise by the community for their execution decide all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concern any matter of right and punish those offences which any member hath commit against the society with such penalties as the law have establish whereby it be easy to discern who be and be not in political society together those who be unite into one body and have a common establish law and judicature to appeal to with authority to decide controversies between them and punish offenders be in civil society one with another but those who have no such common appeal i mean on earth be still in the state of nature each be where there be no other judge for himself and executioner which be as i have before show it the perfect state of nature and thus the commonwealth come by a power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several transgressions they think worthy of it commit amongst the members of that society which be the power of make laws as well as it have the power to punish any injury do unto any of its members by any one that be not of it which be the power of war and peace and all this for the preservation of the property of all the members of that society as far as be possible but though every man enter into society have quit his power to punish offences against the law of nature in prosecution of his own private judgment yet with the judgment of offences which he have give up to the legislative in all case where he can appeal to the magistrate he have give up a right to the commonwealth to employ his force for the execution of the judgments of the commonwealth whenever he shall be call to it which indeed be his own judgements they be make by himself or his representative and herein we have the original of the legislative and executive power of civil society which be to judge by stand laws how far offences be to be punish when commit within the commonwealth and also by occasional judgments found on the present circumstances of the fact how far injuries from without be to be vindicate and in both these to employ all the force of all the members when there shall be need wherever therefore any number of men so unite into one society as to quit every one his executive power of the law of nature and to resign it to the public there and there only be a political or civil society and this be do wherever any number of men in the state of nature enter into society to make one people one body politic under one supreme government or else when any one join himself to and incorpo rat with any government already make for hereby he authorise the society or which be all one the legislative thereof to make laws for him as the public good of the society shall require to the execution whereof his own assistance as to his own decree be due and this put men out of a state of nature into that of a commonwealth by set up a judge on earth with authority to determine all the controversies and redress the injuries that may happen to any member of the commonwealth which judge be the legislative or magistrates appoint by it and wherever there be any number of men however associate that have no such decisive power to appeal to there they be still in the state of nature and hence it be evident that absolute monarchy which by some men be count for the only government in the world be indeed inconsistent with civil society and so can be not form of civil government at all for the end of civil society be to avoid and remedy those inconvenience of the state of nature which necessarily follow from every man be judge in his own case by set up a know authority to which every one of that society may appeal upon any injury receive or controversy that may arise and which every one of the society ought to obey wherever any persons be who have not such an authority to appeal to and decide any difference between them there those persons be still in the state of nature and so be every absolute prince in respect of those who be under his dominion for he be suppose to have all both legislative and executive power in himself alone there be no judge to be find no appeal lie open to any one who may fairly and indifferently and with authority decide and from whence relief and redress may be expect of any injury or inconveniency that may be suffer from him or by his order so that such a man however entitle czar or grand signior or how you please be as much in the state of nature with all under his dominion as he be with the rest of mankind for wherever any two men be who have no stand rule and common judge to appeal to on earth for the determination of controversies of right betwixt them there they be still in the state of nature and under all the inconveniencies of it with only this woeful difference to the subject or rather slave of an absolute prince that whereas in the ordinary state of nature he have a liberty to judge of his right accord to the best of his power to maintain it but whenever his property be invade by the will and order of his monarch he have not only no appeal as those in society ought to have but as if he be degrade from the common state of rational creatures be deny a liberty to judge of or defend his right and so be expose to all the misery and inconveniencies that a man can fear from one who be in the unrestrained state of nature be yet corrupt with flattery and arm with power for he that think absolute power purify mens blood and correct the baseness of human nature need read but the history of this or any other age to be convince to the contrary he that would have be insolent and injurious in the woods of america would not probably be much better on a throne where perhaps learn and religion shall be find out to justify all that he shall do to his subject and the sword presently silence all those that dare question it for what the protection of absolute monarchy be what kind of father of their countries it make princes to be and to what a degree of happiness and security it carry civil society where this sort of government be grow to perfection he that will look into the late relation of ceylon may easily see in absolute monarchies indeed as well as other governments of the world the subject have an appeal to the law and judge to decide any controversies and restrain any violence that may happen betwixt the subject themselves one amongst another this every one think necessary and believe he deserve to be think a declare enemy to society and mankind who should go about to take it away but whether this be from a true love of mankind and society and such a charity as we owe all one to another there be reason to doubt for this be no more than what every man who love his own power profit or greatness may and naturally must do keep those animals from hurt or destroy one another who labour and drudge only for his pleasure and advantage and so be take care of not out of any love the master have for them but love of himself and the profit they bring him for if it be ask what security what fence be there in such a state against the violence and oppression of this absolute ruler the very question can scarce be bear they be ready to tell you that it deserve death only to ask after safety betwixt subject and subject they will grant there must be measure laws and judge for their mutual peace and security but as for the ruler he ought to be absolute and be above all such circumstances because he have a power to do more hurt and wrong it be right when he do it to ask how you may be guard from or injury on that side where the strongest hand be to do it be presently the voice of faction and rebellion as if when men quit the state of nature enter into society they agree that all of them but one should be under the restraint of laws but that he should still retain all the liberty of the state of nature increase with power and make licentious by impunity this be to think that men be so foolish that they take care to avoid what mischiefs may be do them by polecats or fox but be content nay think it safety to be devour by lions but whatever flatterers may talk to amuse people understand it never hinder men from feel and when they perceive that any man in what station soever be out of the bound of the civil society they be of and that they have no appeal on earth against any harm they may receive from him they be apt to think themselves in the state of nature in respect of him whom they find to be so and to take care as soon as they can to have that safety and security in civil society for which it be first institute and for which only they enter into it and therefore though perhaps at first as shall be show more at large hereafter in the follow part of this discourse some one good and excellent man have get a preeminency amongst the rest have this deference pay to his goodness and virtue as to a kind of natural authority that the chief rule with arbitration of their differences by a tacit consent devolve into his hand without any other caution but the assurance they have of his uprightness and wisdom yet when time give authority and as some men would persuade us sacredness to customs which the negligent and unforeseeing innocence of the first age begin have bring in successors of another stamp the people find their properties not secure under the government as then it be whereas government have no other end but the preservation of property could never be safe nor at rest nor think themselves in civil society till the legislative be so place in collective body of men call them senate parliament or what you please by which mean every single person become subject equally with other the meanest men to those laws which he himself as part of the legislative have establish nor could any one by his own authority avoid the force of the law when once make nor by any pretence of superiority plead exemption thereby to license his own or the miscarriages of any of his dependants no man in civil society can be exempt from the laws of it for if any man may do what he think fit and there be no appeal on earth for redress or security against any harm he shall do i ask whether he be not perfectly still in the state of nature and so can be no part or member of that civil society unless any one will say the state of nature and civil society be one and the same thing which i have never yet find any one so great a patron of anarchy as to affirm iii of the begin of political societies men be as have be say by nature all free equal and independent no one can be put out of this estate and subject to the political power of another without his own consent which be do by agree with other men to join and unite into a community for their comfortable safe and peaceable live one amongst another in a secure enjoyment of their properties and a greater security against any that be not of it this any number of men may do because it injure not the freedom of the rest they be leave as they be in the liberty of the state of nature when any number of men have so consent to make one community or government they be thereby presently incorporate and make one body politic wherein the majority have a right to act and conclude the rest for when any number of men have by the consent of every individual make a community they have thereby make that community one body with a power to act as one body which be only by the will and determination of the majority for that which act any community be only the consent of the individuals of it and it be one body must move one way it be necessary the body should move that way whither the greater force carry it which be the consent of the majority or else it be impossible it should act or continue one body one community which the consent of every individual that unite into it agree that it should and so every one be bind by that consent to be conclude by the majority and therefore we see that in assemblies empower to act by positive laws where no number be set by that positive law which empower them the act of the majority pass for the act of the whole and of course determine as have by the law of nature and reason the power of the whole and thus every man by consent with others to make one body politic under one government put himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the determination of the majority and to be conclude by it or else this original compact whereby he with others incorporate into one society would signify nothing and be no compact if he be leave free and under no other tie than he be in before in the state of nature for what appearance would there be of any compact what new engagement if he be no farther tie by any decree of the society than he himself think fit and do actually consent to this would be still as great a liberty as he himself have before his compact or any one else in the state of nature who may submit himself and consent to any act of it if he think fit for if the consent of the majority shall not in reason be receive as the act of the whole and conclude every individual nothing but the consent of every individual can make anything to be the act of the whole which consider the infirmities of health and avocations of business which in a number though much less than that of a commonwealth will necessarily keep many away from the public assembly and the variety of opinions and contrariety of interest which unavoidably happen in all collections of men it be next impossible ever to be have and therefore if come into society be upon such term it will be only like catos come into the theatre tantum ut exiret such a constitution as this would make the mighty leviathan of a shorter duration than the feeblest creatures and not let it outlast the day it be bear in which can not be suppose till we can think that rational creatures should desire and constitute societies only to be dissolve for where the majority can not conclude the rest there they can not act as one body and consequently will be immediately dissolve again whosoever therefore out of a state of nature unite into a community must be understand to give up all the power necessary to the end for which they unite into society to the majority of the community unless they expressly agree in any number greater than the majority and this be do by barely agree to unite into one political society which be all the compact that be or need be between the individuals that enter into or make up a commonwealth and thus that which begin and actually constitute any political society be nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of majority to unite and incorporate into such a society and this be that and that only which do or could give begin to any lawful government in the world to this i find two objections make that there be no instance to be find in story of a company of men independent and equal one amongst another that meet together and in this way begin and set up a government it be impossible of right that men should do so because all men be bear under government they be to submit to that and be not at liberty to begin a new one to the first there be this to answer that it be not at all to be wonder that history give us but a very little account of men that live together in the state of nature the inconveniencies of that condition and the love and want of society no sooner bring any number of them together but they presently unite and in corporated if they design to continue together and if we may not suppose men ever to have be in the state of nature because we hear not much of them in such a state we may as well suppose the armies of salmanasser or xerxes be never children because we hear little of them till they be men and embody in armies government be everywhere antecedent to record and letter seldom come in amongst a people till a long continuation of civil society have by other more necessary arts provide for their safety ease and plenty and then they begin to look after the history of their founder and search into their original when they have outlive the memory of it for it be with commonwealths as with particular persons they be commonly ignorant of their own birth and infancies and if they know anything of it they be behold for it to the accidental record that others have keep of it and those that we have of the begin of any polities in the world except that of the jews where god himself immediately interpose and which favour not at all paternal dominion be all either plain instance of such a begin as i have mention or at least have manifest footsteps of it he must show a strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact when it agree not with his hypothesis who will not allow that the begin of rome and venice be by the unite together of several men free and independent one of another amongst whom there be no natural superiority or subjection and if josephus acostas word may be take he tell us that in many part of america there be no government at all there be great and apparent conjecture say he that these men speak of those of peru for a long time have neither kings nor commonwealths but live in troop as they do this day in florida the cheriquanas those of brazil and many other nations which have no certain kings but as occasion be offer in peace or war they choose their captain as they please lib i cap if it be say that every man there be bear subject to his father or the head of his family that the subjection due from a child to a father take away not his freedom of unite into what political society he think fit have be already prove but be that as it will these men it be evident be actually free and whatever superiority some politicians now would place in any of them they themselves claim it not but by consent be all equal till by the same consent they set rulers over themselves so that their politic societies all begin from a voluntary union and the mutual agreement of men freely act in the choice of their governors and form of govern ment and i hope those who go away from sparta with palantus mention by justin will be allow to have be freemen independent one of another and to have set up a government over themselves by their own consent thus i have give several examples out of history of people free and in the state of nature that be meet together incorporate and begin a commonwealth and if the want of such instance be an argument to prove that government be not nor could not be so begin i suppose the contenders for paternal empire be better let it alone than urge it against natural liberty for if they can give so many instance out of history of governments begin upon paternal right i think though at least an argument from what have be to what should of right be of no great force one might without any great danger yield them the cause but if i might advise them in the case they would do well not to search too much into the original of governments as they have begin de facto lest they should find at the foundation of most of them something very little favourable to the design they promote and such a power as they contend for but to conclude reason be plain on our side that men be naturally free and the examples of history show that the governments of the world that be begin in peace have their begin lay on that foundation and be make by the consent of the people there can be little room for doubt either where the right be or what have be the opinion or practice of mankind about the first erect of governments i will not deny that if we look back as far as history will direct us towards the original of commonwealths we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man and i be also apt to believe that where a family be numerous enough to subsist by itself and continue entire together without mix with others as it often happen where there be much land and few people the government commonly begin in the father for the father have by the law of nature the same power with every man else to punish as he think fit any offences against that law might thereby punish his transgress children even when they be men and out of their pupilage and they be very likely to submit to his punishment and all join with him against the offender in their turn give him thereby power to execute his sentence against any transgression and so in effect make him the lawmaker and governor over all that remain in conjunction with his family he be fittest to be trust paternal affection secure their property and interest under his care and the custom of obey him in their childhood make it easier to submit to him rather than any other if therefore they must have one to rule them as government be hardly to be avoid amongst men that live together who so likely to be the man as he that be their common father unless negligence cruelty or any other defect of mind or body make him unfit for it but when either the father die and leave his next heirfor want of age wisdom courage or any other qualitiesless fit for rule or where several families meet and consent to continue together there it be not to be doubt but they use their natural freedom to set up him whom they judge the ablest and most likely to rule well over them conformable hereunto we find the people of america wholiving out of the reach of the conquer swords and spread domination of the two great empires of peru and mexico enjoy their own natural freedom though caeteris paribus they commonly prefer the heir of their decease king yet if they find him any way weak or incapable they pass him by and set up the stoutest and bravest man for their ruler thus though look back as far as record give us any account of people the world and the history of nations we commonly find the government to be in one hand yet it destroy not that which i affirmviz that the begin of politic society depend upon the consent of the individuals to join into and make one society who when they be thus incorporate might set up what form of government they think fit but this have give occasion to men to mistake and think that by nature government be monarchical and belong to the father it may not be amiss here to consider why people in the begin generally pitch upon this form which though perhaps the father preeminency might in the first institution of some commonwealths give a rise to and place in the begin the power in one hand yet it be plain that the reason that continue the form of government in a single person be not any regard or respect to paternal authority since all petty monarchies that be almost all monarchies near their original have be commonly at least upon occasion elective first then in the begin of things the father government of the childhood of those spring from him have accustom them to the rule of one man and teach them that where it be exercise with care and skill with affection and love to those under it it be sufficient to procure and preserve men all the political happiness they seek for in society it be no wonder that they should pitch upon and naturally run into that form of government which from their infancy they have be all accustom to and which by experience they have find both easy and safe to which if we add that monarchy be simple and most obvious to men whom neither experience have instruct in form of government nor the ambition or insolence of empire have teach to beware of the encroachments of prerogative or the inconveniencies of absolute power which monarchy in succession be apt to lay claim to and bring upon them it be not at all strange that they should not much trouble themselves to think of methods of restrain any exorbitances of those to whom they have give the authority over them and of balance the power of government by place several part of it in different hand they have neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion nor do the fashion of the age nor their possessions or way of live which afford little matter for covetousness or ambition give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it and therefore it be no wonder they put themselves into such a frame of government as be not only as i say most obvious and simple but also best suit to their present state and condition which stand more in need of defence against foreign invasions and injuries than of multiplicity of laws where there be but very little property and want not variety of rulers and abundance of officer to direct and look after their execution where there be but few trespassers and few offenders since then those who like one another so well as to join into society can not but be suppose to have some acquaintance and friendship together and some trust one in another they could not but have greater apprehensions of others than of one another and therefore their first care and think can not but be suppose to be how to secure themselves against foreign force it be natural for them to put themselves under a frame of government which might best serve to that end and choose the wisest and bravest man to conduct them in their war and lead them out against their enemies and in this chiefly be their ruler thus we see that the kings of the indians in america which be still a pattern of the first age in asia and europe whilst the inhabitants be too few for the country and want of people and money give men no temptation to enlarge their possessions of land or contest for wider extent of grind be little more than general of their armies and though they command absolutely in war yet at home and in time of peace they exercise very little dominion and have but a very moderate sovereignty the resolutions of peace and war be ordinarily either in the people or in a council though the war itself which admit not of pluralities of governors naturally evolve the command into the kings sole authority and thus in israel itself the chief business of their judge and first kings seem to have be to be captain in war and leaders of their armies which besides what be signify by go out and in before the people which be to march forth to war and home again at the head of their force appear plainly in the story of jephtha the ammonites make war upon israel the gileadites in fear send to jephtha a bastard of their family whom they have cast off and article with him if he will assist them against the ammonites to make him their ruler which they do in these word and the people make him head and captain over them judge which be as it seem all one as to be judge and he judge israel judge that be be their captaingeneral six years so when jotham upbraid the shechemites with the obligation they have to gideon who have be their judge and ruler he tell them he fight for you and adventure his life for and deliver you out of the hand of midian judge nothing mention of him but what he do as a general and indeed that be all be find in his history or in any of the rest of the judge and abimelech particularly be call king though at most he be but their general and when be weary of the illconduct of samuels sons the children of israel desire a king like all the nations to judge them and to go out before them and to fight their battle sam god grant their desire say to samuel i will send thee a man and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines ch as if the only business of a king have be to lead out their armies and fight in their defence and accordingly at his inauguration pour a vial of oil upon him declare to saul that the lord have anoint him to be captain over his inheritance ch and therefore those who after saul be solemnly choose and salute king by the tribes at mispah be unwilling to have him their king make no other objection but this how shall this man save us ch as if they should have say this man be unfit to be our king not have skill and conduct enough in war to be able to defend us and when god resolve to transfer the government to david it be in these word but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath seek him a man after his own heart and the lord hath command him to be captain over his people ch as if the whole kingly authority be nothing else but to be their general and therefore the tribes who have stick to sauls family and oppose davids reign when they come to hebron with term of submission to him they tell him amongst other arguments they have to submit to him as to their king that he be in effect their king in sauls time and therefore they have no reason but to receive him as their king now also say they in time past when saul be king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord say unto thee thou shalt fee my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel thus whether a family by degrees grow up into a commonwealth and the fatherly authority be continue on to the elder son every one in his turn grow up under it tacitly submit to it and the easiness and equality of it not offend any one every one acquiesce till time seem to have confirm it and settle a right of succession by prescription or whether several families or the descendants of several families whom chance neighbourhood or business bring together unite into society the need of a general whose conduct might defend them against their enemies in war and the great confidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but virtuous age such as be almost all those which begin governments that ever come to last in the world give men one of another make the first beginners of commonwealths generally put the rule into one man hand without any other express limitation or restraint but what the nature of the thing and the end of government require it be give them for the public good and safety and to those end in the infancies of commonwealths they commonly use it and unless they have do so young societies could not have subsist without such nurse father without this care of the governors all governments would have sink under the weakness and infirmities of their infancy the prince and the people have soon perish together but the golden age though before vain ambition and amor sceleratus habendi evil concupiscence have corrupt mens mind into a mistake of true power and honour have more virtue and consequently better governors as well as less vicious subject and there be then no stretch prerogative on the one side to oppress the people nor consequently on the other any dispute about privilege to lessen or restrain the power of the magistrate and so no contest betwixt rulers and people about governors or government yet when ambition and luxury in future age would retain and increase the power without do the business for which it be give and aid by flattery teach princes to have distinct and separate interest from their people men find it necessary to examine more carefully the original and right of government and to find out ways to restrain the exorbitances and prevent the abuse of that power which they have entrust in anothers hand only for their own good they find be make use of to hurt them thus we may see how probable it be that people that be naturally free and by their own consent either submit to the government of their father or unite together out of different families to make a government should generally put the rule into one man hand and choose to be under the conduct of a single person without so much as by express condition limit or regulate his power which they think safe enough in his honesty and prudence though they never dream of monarchy be jure divino which we never hear of among mankind till it be reveal to us by the divinity of this last age nor ever allow paternal power to have a right to dominion or to be the foundation of all government and thus much may suffice to show that as far as we have any light from history we have reason to conclude that all peaceful beginnings of government have be lay in the consent of the people i say peaceful because i shall have occasion in another place to speak of conquest which some esteem a way of begin of governments the other objection i find urge against the begin of polities in the way i have mention be this viz that all men be bear under government some or other it be impossible any of them should ever be free and at liberty to unite together and begin a new one or ever be able to erect a lawful government if this argument be good i ask how come so many lawful monarchies into the world for if anybody upon this supposition can show me any one man in any age of the world free to begin a lawful monarchy i will be bind to show him ten other free men at liberty at the same time to unite and begin a new government under a regal or any other form it be demonstration that if any one bear under the dominion of another may be so free as to have a right to command others in a new and distinct empire every one that be bear under the dominion of another may be so free too and may become a ruler or subject of a distinct separate government and so by this their own principle either all men however bear be free or else there be but one lawful prince one lawful government in the world and then they have nothing to do but barely to show us which that be which when they have do i doubt not but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him though it be a sufficient answer to their objection to show that it involve them in the same difficulties that it doth those they use it against yet i shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this argument a little farther all men say they be bear under government and therefore they can not be at liberty to begin a new one every one be bear a subject to his father or his prince and be therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it be plain mankind never own nor consider any such natural subjection that they be bear in to one or to the other that tie them without their own consent to a subjection to them and their heirs for there be no examples so frequent in history both sacred and profane as those of men withdraw themselves and their obedience from the jurisdiction they be bear under and the family or community they be breed up in and set up new governments in other place from whence spring all that number of petty commonwealths in the begin of age and which always multiply as long as there be room enough till the stronger or more fortunate swallow the weaker and those great ones again break to piece dissolve into lesser dominions all which be so many testimonies against paternal sovereignty and plainly prove that it be not the natural right of the father descend to his heirs that make governments in the begin since it be impossible upon that grind there should have be so many little kingdoms but only one universal monarchy if men have not be at liberty to separate themselves from their families and their government be it what it will that be set up in it and go and make distinct commonwealths and other governments as they think fit this have be the practice of the world from its first begin to this day nor be it now any more hindrance to the freedom of mankind that they be bear under constitute and ancient polities that have establish laws and set form of government than if they be bear in the woods amongst the unconfined inhabitants that run loose in them for those who would persuade us that by be bear under any government we be naturally subject to it and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature have no other reason bat that of paternal power which we have already answer to produce for it but only because our father or progenitors pass away their natural liberty and thereby bind up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government which they themselves submit to it be true that whatever engagements or promise any one make for himself he be under the obligation of them but can not by any compact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man be altogether as free as the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of anybody else he may indeed annex such condition to the land he enjoy as a subject of any commonwealth as may oblige his son to be of that community if he will enjoy those possessions which be his father because that estate be his father property he may dispose or settle it as he please and this have generally give the occasion to the mistake in this matter because commonwealths not permit any part of their dominions to be dismember nor to be enjoy by any but those of their community the son can not ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his father but under the same term his father do by become a member of the society whereby he put himself presently under the government he find there establish as much as any other subject of that commonweal and thus the consent of free men bear under government which only make them members of it be give separately in their turn as each come to be of age and not in a multitude together people take no notice of it and think it not do at all or not necessary conclude they be naturally subject as they be men but it be plain governments themselves understand it otherwise they claim no power over the son because of that they have over the father nor look on children as be their subject by their father be so if a subject of england have a child by an englishwoman in france whose subject be he not the king of englands for he must have leave to be admit to the privilege of it nor the king of frances for how then have his father a liberty to bring him away and breed him as he please and whoever be judge as a traitor or deserter if he leave or war against a country for be barely bear in it of parent that be alien there it be plain then by the practice of governments themselves as well as by the law of right reason that a child be bear a subject of no country nor government he be under his father tuition and authority till he come to age of discretion and then he be a free man at liberty what government he will put himself under what body politic he will unite himself to for if an englishmans son bear in france be at liberty and may do so it be evident there be no tie upon him by his father be a subject of that kingdom nor be he bind up by any compact of his ancestors and why then hath not his son by the same reason the same liberty though he be bear anywhere else since the power that a father hath naturally over his children be the same wherever they be bear and the tie of natural obligations be not bound by the positive limit of kingdoms and commonwealths every man be as have be show naturally free and nothing be able to put him into subjection to any earthly power but only his own consent it be to be consider what shall be understand to be a sufficient declaration of a man consent to make him subject to the laws of any government there be a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent which will concern our present case nobody doubt but an express consent of any man enter into any society make him a perfect member of that society a subject of that government the difficulty be what ought to be look upon as a tacit consent and how far it bindsie how far any one shall be look on to have consent and thereby submit to any government where he have make no expressions of it at all and to this i say that every man that hath any possession or enjoyment of any part of the dominions of any government doth hereby give his tacit consent and be as far forth oblige to obedience to the laws of that government during such enjoyment as any one under it whether this his possession be of land to him and his heirs for ever or a lodge only for a week or whether it be barely travel freely on the highway and in effect it reach as far as the very be of any one within the territories of that government to understand this the better it be fit to consider that every man when he at first incorporate himself into any commonwealth he by his unite himself thereunto annex also and submit to the community those possessions which he have or shall acquire that do not already belong to any other government for it would be a direct contradiction for any one to enter into society with others for the secure and regulate of property and yet to suppose his land whose property be to be regulate by the laws of the society should be exempt from the jurisdiction of that government to which he himself and the property of the land be a subject by the same act therefore whereby any one unite his person which be before free to any commonwealth by the same he unite his possessions which be before free to it also and they become both of them person and possession subject to the government and dominion of that commonwealth as long as it hath a be whoever therefore from thenceforth by inheritance purchase permission or otherwise enjoy any part of the land so annex to and under the government of that commonweal must take it with the condition it be underthat be of submit to the government of the commonwealth under whose jurisdiction it be as far forth as any subject of it but since the government have a direct jurisdiction only over the land and reach the possessor of it before he have actually incorporate himself in the society only as he dwell upon and enjoy that the obligation any one be under by virtue of such enjoyment to submit to the government begin and end with the enjoyment so that whenever the owner who have give nothing but such a tacit consent to the government will by donation sale or otherwise quit the say possession he be at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other commonwealth or agree with others to begin a new one in vacuis locis in any part of the world they can find free and unpossessed whereas he that have once by actual agreement and any express declaration give his consent to be of any commonweal be perpetually and indispensably oblige to be and remain unalterably a subject to it and can never be again in the liberty of the state of nature unless by any calamity the government he be under come to be dissolve but submit to the laws of any country live quietly and enjoy privilege and protection under them make not a man a member of that society it be only a local protection and homage due to and from all those who not be in a state of war come within the territories belong to any government to all part whereof the force of its law extend but this no more make a man a member of that society a perpetual subject of that commonwealth than it would make a man a subject to another in whose family he find it convenient to abide for some time though whilst he continue in it he be oblige to comply with the laws and submit to the government he find there and thus we see that foreigners by live all their live under another government and enjoy the privilege and protection of it though they be bind even in conscience to submit to its administration as far forth as any denizen yet do not thereby come to be subject or members of that commonwealth nothing can make any man so but his actually enter into it by positive engagement and express promise and compact this be that which i think concern the begin of political societies and that consent which make any one a member of any commonwealth of the end of political society and government if man in the state of nature be so free as have be say if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions equal to the greatest and subject to nobody why will he part with his freedom this empire and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power to which it be obvious to answer that though in the state of nature he hath such a right yet the enjoyment of it be very uncertain and constantly expose to the invasion of others for all be kings as much as he every man his equal and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice the enjoyment of the property he have in this state be very unsafe very insecure this make him will to quit this condition which however free be full of fear and continual dangers and it be not without reason that he seek out and be will to join in society with others who be already unite or have a mind to unite for the mutual preservation of their live liberties and estates which i call by the general nameproperty the great and chief end therefore of men unite into commonwealths and put themselves under government be the preservation of their property to which in the state of nature there be many things want firstly there want an establish settle know law receive and allow by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong and the common measure to decide all controversies between them for though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures yet men be bias by their interest as well as ignorant for want of study of it be not apt to allow of it as a law bind to them in the application of it to their particular case secondly in the state of nature there want a know and indifferent judge with authority to determine all differences accord to the establish law for every one in that state be both judge and executioner of the law of nature men be partial to themselves passion and revenge be very apt to carry them too far and with too much heat in their own case as well as negligence and unconcernedness make them too remiss in other mens thirdly in the state of nature there often want power to back and support the sentence when right and to give it due execution they who by any injustice offend will seldom fail where they be able by force to make good their injustice such resistance many time make the punishment dangerous and frequently destructive to those who attempt it thus mankind notwithstanding all the privilege of the state of nature be but in an ill condition while they remain in it be quickly drive into society hence it come to pass that we seldom find any number of men live any time together in this state the inconveniencies that they be therein expose to by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the power every man have of punish the transgressions of others make them take sanctuary under the establish laws of government and therein seek the preservation of their property it be this that make them so willingly give up every one his single power of punish to be exercise by such alone as shall be appoint to it amongst them and by such rule as the community or those authorise by them to that purpose shall agree on and in this we have the original right and rise of both the legislative and executive power as well as of the governments and societies themselves for in the state of nature to omit the liberty he have of innocent delight a man have two power the first be to do whatsoever he think fit for the preservation of himself and others within the permission of the law of nature by which law common to them all he and all the rest of mankind be one community make up one society distinct from all other creatures and be it not for the corruption and viciousness of degenerate men there would be no need of any other no necessity that men should separate from this great and natural community and associate into lesser combinations the other power a man have in the state of nature be the power to punish the crimes commit against that law both these he give up when he join in a private if i may so call it or particular political society and incorporate into any commonwealth separate from the rest of mankind the first powerviz of do whatsoever he think fit for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind he give up to be regulate by laws make by the society so far forth as the preservation of himself and the rest of that society shall require which laws of the society in many things confine the liberty he have by the law of nature secondly the power of punish he wholly give up and engage his natural force which he might before employ in the execution of the law of nature by his own single authority as he think fit to assist the executive power of the society as the law thereof shall require for be now in a new state wherein he be to enjoy many conveniencies from the labour assistance and society of others in the same community as well as protection from its whole strength he be to part also with as much of his natural liberty in provide for himself as the good prosperity and safety of the society shall require which be not only necessary but just since the other members of the society do the like but though men when they enter into society give up the equality liberty and executive power they have in the state of nature into the hand of the society to be so far dispose of by the legislative as the good of the society shall require yet it be only with an intention in every one the better to preserve himself his liberty and property for no rational creature can be suppose to change his condition with an intention to be worse the power of the society or legislative constitute by them can never be suppose to extend farther than the common good but be oblige to secure every ones property by provide against those three defect above mention that make the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy and so whoever have the legislative or supreme power of any commonwealth be bind to govern by establish stand laws promulgate and know to the people and not by extemporary decree by indifferent and upright judge who be to decide controversies by those laws and to employ the force of the community at home only in the execution of such laws or abroad to prevent or redress foreign injuries and secure the community from inroads and invasion and all this to be direct to no other end but the peace safety and public good of the people of the form of a commonwealth the majority have as have be show upon mens first unite into society the whole power of the community naturally in them may employ all that power in make laws for the community from time to time and execute those laws by officer of their own appoint and then the form of the government be a perfect democracy or else may put the power of make laws into the hand of a few select men and their heirs or successors and then it be an oligarchy or else into the hand of one man and then it be a monarchy if to him and his heirs it be a hereditary monarchy if to him only for life but upon his death the power only of nominate a successor to return to them an elective monarchy and so accordingly of these make compound and mix form of government as they think good and if the legislative power be at first give by the majority to one or more persons only for their live or any limit time and then the supreme power to revert to them again when it be so revert the community may dispose of it again anew into what hand they please and so constitute a new form of government for the form of government depend upon the place the supreme power which be the legislative it be impossible to conceive that an inferior power should prescribe to a superior or any but the supreme make laws accord as the power of make laws be place such be the form of the commonwealth by commonwealth i must be understand all along to mean not a democracy or any form of government but any independent community which the latins signify by the word civitas to which the word which best answer in our language be commonwealth and most properly express such a society of men which community do not for there may be subordinate communities in a government and city much less and therefore to avoid ambiguity i crave leave to use the word commonwealth in that sense in which sense i find the word use by king jam himself which i think to be its genuine signification which if anybody dislike i consent with him to change it for a better of the extent of the legislative power the great end of mens enter into society be the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety and the great instrument and mean of that be the laws establish in that society the first and fundamental positive law of all commonwealths be the establish of the legislative power as the first and fundamental natural law which be to govern even the legislative itself be the preservation of the society and as far as will consist with the public good of every person in it this legislative be not only the supreme power of the commonwealth but sacred and unalterable in the hand where the community have once place it nor can any edict of anybody else in what form soever conceive or by what power soever back have the force and obligation of a law which have not its sanction from that legislative which the public have choose and appoint for without this the law could not have that which be absolutely necessary to its be a law the consent of the society over whom nobody can have a power to make laws but by their own consent and by authority receive from them and therefore all the obedience which by the most solemn tie any one can be oblige to pay ultimately terminate in this supreme power and be direct by those laws which it enact nor can any oaths to any foreign power whatsoever or any domestic subordinate power discharge any member of the society from his obedience to the legislative act pursuant to their trust nor oblige him to any obedience contrary to the laws so enact or farther than they do allow it be ridiculous to imagine one can be tie ultimately to obey any power in the society which be not the supreme though the legislative whether place in one or more whether it be always in be or only by intervals though it be the supreme power in every commonwealth yet first it be not nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the live and fortunes of the people for it be but the joint power of every member of the society give up to that person or assembly which be legislator it can be no more than those persons have in a state of nature before they enter into society and give it up to the community for nobody can transfer to another more power than he have in himself and nobody have an absolute arbitrary power over himself or over any other to destroy his own life or take away the life or property of another a man as have be prove can not subject himself to the arbitrary power of another and have in the state of nature no arbitrary power over the life liberty or possession of another but only so much as the law of nature give him for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind this be all he doth or can give up to the commonwealth and by it to the legislative power so that the legislative can have no more than this their power in the utmost bound of it be limit to the public good of the society it be a power that hath no other end but preservation and therefore can never have a right to destroy enslave or designedly to impoverish the subject the obligations of the law of nature cease not in society but only in many case be draw closer and have by human laws know penalties annex to them to enforce their observation thus the law of nature stand as an eternal rule to all men legislators as well as others the rule that they make for other mens action must as well as their own and other mens action be conformable to the law of nature ie to the will of god of which that be a declaration and the fundamental law of nature be the preservation of mankind no human sanction can be good or valid against it secondly the legislative or supreme authority can not assume to itself a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decree but be bind to dispense justice and decide the right of the subject by promulgate stand laws and know authorise judge for the law of nature be unwritten and so nowhere to be find but in the mind of men they who through passion or interest shall miscite or misapply it can not so easily be convince of their mistake where there be no establish judge and so it serve not as it aught to determine the right and fence the properties of those that live under it especially where every one be judge interpreter and executioner of it too and that in his own case and he that have right on his side have ordinarily but his own single strength hath not force enough to defend himself from injuries or punish delinquents to avoid these inconveniencies which disorder mens properties in the state of nature men unite into societies that they may have the unite strength of the whole society to secure and defend their properties and may have stand rule to bind it by which every one may know what be his to this end it be that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into and the community put the legislative power into such hand as they think fit with this trust that they shall be govern by declare laws or else their peace quiet and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it be in the state of nature absolute arbitrary power or govern without settle stand laws can neither of them consist with the end of society and government which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for and tie themselves up under be it not to preserve their live liberties and fortunes and by state rule of right and property to secure their peace and quiet it can not be suppose that they should intend have they a power so to do to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates and put a force into the magistrates hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them this be to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature wherein they have a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others and be upon equal term of force to maintain it whether invade by a single man or many in combination whereas by suppose they have give up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator they have disarm themselves and arm him to make a prey of them when he please he be in a much worse condition that be expose to the arbitrary power of one man who have the command of a hundred thousand than he that be expose to the arbitrary power of a hundred thousand single men nobody be secure that his will who have such a command be better than that of other men though his force be a hundred thousand time stronger and therefore whatever form the commonwealth be under the rule power ought to govern by declare and receive laws and not by extemporary dictate and undetermined resolutions for then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature if they shall have arm one or a few men with the joint power of a multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decree of their sudden thoughts or unrestrained and till that moment unknown will without have any measure set down which may guide and justify their action for all the power the government have be only for the good of the society as it ought not to be arbitrary and at pleasure so it ought to be exercise by establish and promulgate laws that both the people may know their duty and be safe and secure within the limit of the law and the rulers too keep within their due bound and not be tempt by the power they have in their hand to employ it to purpose and by such measure as they would not have know and own not willingly thirdly the supreme power can not take from any man any part of his property without his own consent for the preservation of property be the end of government and that for which men enter into society it necessarily suppose and require that the people should have property without which they must be suppose to lose that by enter into society which be the end for which they enter into it too gross an absurdity for any man to own men therefore in society have property they have such a right to the goods which by the law of the community be theirs that nobody hath a right to take them or any part of them from them without their own consent without this they have no property at all for i have truly no property in that which another can by right take from me when he please against my consent hence it be a mistake to think that the supreme or legislative power of any commonwealth can do what it will and dispose of the estates of the subject arbitrarily or take any part of them at pleasure this be not much to be fear in governments where the legislative consist wholly or in part in assemblies which be variable whose members upon the dissolution of the assembly be subject under the common laws of their country equally with the rest but in governments where the legislative be in one last assembly always in be or in one man as in absolute monarchies there be danger still that they will think themselves to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community and so will be apt to increase their own riches and power by take what they think fit from the people for a man property be not at all secure though there be good and equitable laws to set the bound of it between him and his fellowsubjects if he who command those subject have power to take from any private man what part he please of his property and use and dispose of it as he think good but government into whosesoever hand it be put be as i have before show entrust with this condition and for this end that men might have and secure their properties the prince or senate however it may have power to make laws for the regulate of property between the subject one amongst another yet can never have a power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the subject property without their own consent for this would be in effect to leave them no property at all and to let us see that even absolute power where it be necessary be not arbitrary by be absolute but be still limit by that reason and confine to those end which require it in some case to be absolute we need look no farther than the common practice of martial discipline for the preservation of the army and in it of the whole commonwealth require an absolute obedience to the command of every superior officer and it be justly death to disobey or dispute the most dangerous or unreasonable of them but yet we see that neither the sergeant that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a cannon or stand in a breach where he be almost sure to perish can command that soldier to give him one penny of his money nor the general that can condemn him to death for desert his post or not obey the most desperate order can not yet with all his absolute power of life and death dispose of one farthing of that soldier estate or seize one jot of his goods whom yet he can command anything and hang for the least disobedience because such a blind obedience be necessary to that end for which the commander have his powerviz the preservation of the rest but the dispose of his goods have nothing to do with it it be true governments can not be support without great charge and it be fit every one who enjoy his share of the protection should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it but still it must be with his own consentie the consent of the majority give it either by themselves or their representatives choose by them for if any one shall claim a power to lay and levy tax on the people by his own authority and without such consent of the people he thereby invade the fundamental law of property and subvert the end of government for what property have i in that which another may by right take when he please to himself fourthly the legislative can not transfer the power of make laws to any other hand for it be but a delegate power from the people they who have it can not pass it over to others the people alone can appoint the form of the commonwealth which be by constitute the legislative and appoint in whose hand that shall be and when the people have say we will submit and be govern by laws make by such men and in such form nobody else can say other men shall make laws for them nor can they be bind by any laws but such as be enact by those whom they have choose and authorise to make laws for them these be the bound which the trust that be put in them by the society and the law of god and nature have set to the legislative power of every commonwealth in all form of government first they be to govern by promulgate establish laws not to be vary in particular case but to have one rule for rich and poor for the favourite at court and the countryman at plough secondly these laws also ought to be design for no other end ultimately but the good of the people thirdly they must not raise tax on the property of the people without the consent of the people give by themselves or their deputies and this properly concern only such governments where the legislative be always in be or at least where the people have not reserve any part of the legislative to deputies to be from time to time choose by themselves fourthly legislative neither must nor can transfer the power of make laws to anybody else or place it anywhere but where the people have the legislative executive and federative power of the commonwealth the legislative power be that which have a right to direct how the force of the commonwealth shall be employ for preserve the community and the members of it because those laws which be constantly to be execute and whose force be always to continue may be make in a little time therefore there be no need that the legislative should be always in be not have always business to do and because it may be too great temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power for the same persons who have the power of make laws to have also in their hand the power to execute them whereby they may exempt themselves from obedience to the laws they make and suit the law both in its make and execution to their own private advantage and thereby come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community contrary to the end of society and government therefore in wellordered commonwealths where the good of the whole be so consider as it ought the legislative power be put into the hand of divers persons who duly assemble have by themselves or jointly with others a power to make laws which when they have do be separate again they be themselves subject to the laws they have make which be a new and near tie upon them to take care that they make them for the public good but because the laws that be at once and in a short time make have a constant and last force and need a perpetual execution or an attendance thereunto therefore it be necessary there should be a power always in be which should see to the execution of the laws that be make and remain in force and thus the legislative and executive power come often to be separate there be another power in every commonwealth which one may call natural because it be that which answer to the power every man naturally have before he enter into society for though in a commonwealth the members of it be distinct persons still in reference to one another and as such be govern by the laws of the society yet in reference to the rest of mankind they make one body which be as every member of it before be still in the state of nature with the rest of mankind so that the controversies that happen between any man of the society with those that be out of it be manage by the public and an injury do to a member of their body engage the whole in the reparation of it so that under this consideration the whole community be one body in the state of nature in respect of all other state or persons out of its community this therefore contain the power of war and peace league and alliances and all the transactions with all persons and communities without the commonwealth and may be call federative if any one please so the thing be understand i be indifferent as to the name these two power executive and federative though they be really distinct in themselves yet one comprehend the execution of the municipal laws of the society within itself upon all that be part of it the other the management of the security and interest of the public without with all those that it may receive benefit or damage from yet they be always almost unite and though this federative power in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the commonwealth yet it be much less capable to be direct by antecedent stand positive laws than the executive and so must necessarily be leave to the prudence and wisdom of those whose hand it be in to be manage for the public good for the laws that concern subject one amongst another be to direct their action may well enough precede them but what be to be do in reference to foreigners depend much upon their action and the variation of design and interest must be leave in great part to the prudence of those who have this power commit to them to be manage by the best of their skill for the advantage of the commonwealth though as i say the executive and federative power of every community be really distinct in themselves yet they be hardly to be separate and place at the same time in the hand of distinct persons for both of them require the force of the society for their exercise it be almost impracticable to place the force of the commonwealth in distinct and not subordinate hand or that the executive and federative power should be place in persons that might act separately whereby the force of the public would be under different command which would be apt some time or other to cause disorder and ruin of the subordination of the power of the commonwealth though in a constitute commonwealth stand upon its own basis and act accord to its own naturethat be act for the preservation of the community there can be but one supreme power which be the legislative to which all the rest be and must be subordinate yet the legislative be only a fiduciary power to act for certain end there remain still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust repose in them for all power give with trust for the attain an end be limit by that end whenever that end be manifestly neglect or oppose the trust must necessarily be forfeit and the power devolve into the hand of those that give it who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security and thus the community perpetually retain a supreme power of save themselves from the attempt and design of anybody even of their legislators whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked as to lay and carry on design against the liberties and properties of the subject for no man or society of men have a power to deliver up their preservation or consequently the mean of it to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion of another whenever any one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition they will always have a right to preserve what they have not a power to part with and to rid themselves of those who invade this fundamental sacred and unalterable law of selfpreservation for which they enter into society and thus the community may be say in this respect to be always the supreme power but not as consider under any form of government because this power of the people can never take place till the government be dissolve in all case whilst the government subsist the legislative be the supreme power for what can give laws to another must need be superior to him and since the legislative be no otherwise legislative of the society but by the right it have to make laws for all the part and every member of the society prescribe rule to their action they be transgress the legislative must need be the supreme and all other power in any members or part of the society derive from and subordinate to it in some commonwealths where the legislative be not always in be and the executive be vest in a single person who have also a share in the legislative there that single person in a very tolerable sense may also be call supreme not that he have in himself all the supreme power which be that of lawmaking but because he have in him the supreme execution from whom all inferior magistrates derive all their several subordinate power or at least the greatest part of them have also no legislative superior to him there be no law to be make without his consent which can not be expect should ever subject him to the other part of the legislative he be properly enough in this sense supreme but yet it be to be observe that though oaths of allegiance and fealty be take to him it be not to him as supreme legislator but as supreme executor of the law make by a joint power of him with others allegiance be nothing but an obedience accord to law which when he violate he have no right to obedience nor can claim it otherwise than as the public person vest with the power of the law and so be to be consider as the image phantom or representative of the commonwealth act by the will of the society declare in its laws and thus he have no will no power but that of the law but when he quit this representa tion this public will and act by his own private will he degrade himself and be but a single private person without power and without will the members owe no obedience but to the public will of the society the executive power place anywhere but in a person that have also a share in the legislative be visibly subordinate and accountable to it and may be at pleasure change and displace so that it be not the supreme executive power that be exempt from subordination but the supreme executive power vest in one who have a share in the legislative have no distinct superior legislative to be subordinate and accountable to farther than he himself shall join and consent so that he be no more subordinate than he himself shall think fit which one may certainly conclude will be but very little of other ministerial and subordinate power in a commonwealth we need not speak they be so multiply with infinite variety in the different customs and constitutions of distinct commonwealths that it be impossible to give a particular account of them all only thus much which be necessary to our present purpose we may take notice of concern them that they have no manner of authority any of them beyond what be by positive grant and commission delegate to them and be all of them accountable to some other power in the commonwealth it be not necessaryno nor so much as convenientthat the legislative should be always in be but absolutely necessary that the executive power should because there be not always need of new laws to be make but always need of execution of the laws that be make when the legislative hath put the execution of the laws they make into other hand they have a power still to resume it out of those hand when they find cause and to punish for any maladministration against the laws the same hold also in regard of the federative power that and the executive be both ministerial and subordinate to the legislative which as have be show in a constitute commonwealth be the supreme the legislative also in this case be suppose to consist of several persons for if it be a single person it can not but be always in be and so will as supreme naturally have the supreme executive power together with the legislative may assemble and exercise their legislative at the time that either their original constitution or their own adjournment appoint or when they please if neither of these hath appoint any time or there be no other way prescribe to convoke them for the supreme power be place in them by the people it be always in them and they may exercise it when they please unless by their original constitution they be limit to certain season or by an act of their supreme power they have adjourn to a certain time and when that time come they have a right to assemble and act again if the legislative or any part of it be of representatives choose for that time by the people which afterwards return into the ordinary state of subject and have no share in the legislative but upon a new choice this power of choose must also be exercise by the people either at certain appoint season or else when they be summon to it and in this latter case the power of convoke the legislative be ordinarily place in the executive and have one of these two limitations in respect of timethat either the original constitution require their assemble and act at certain intervals and then the executive power do nothing but ministerially issue directions for their elect and assemble accord to due form or else it be leave to his prudence to call them by new elections when the occasion or exigencies of the public require the amendment of old or make of new laws or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies that lie on or threaten the people it may be demand here what if the executive power be possess of the force of the commonwealth shall make use of that force to hinder the meet and act of the legislative when the original constitution or the public exigencies require it i say use force upon the people without authority and contrary to the trust put in him that do so be a state of war with the people who have a right to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power for have erect a legislative with an intent they should exercise the power of make laws either at certain set time or when there be need of it when they be hinder by any force from what be so necessary to the society and wherein the safety and preservation of the people consist the people have a right to remove it by force in all state and condition the true remedy of force without authority be to oppose force to it the use of force without authority always put him that use it into a state of war as the aggressor and render him liable to be treat accordingly the power of assemble and dismiss the legislative place in the executive give not the executive a superiority over it but be a fiduciary trust place in him for the safety of the people in a case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affairs could not bear a steady fix rule for it not be possible that the first framers of the government should by any foresight be so much master of future events as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and duration to the assemblies of the legislative in all time to come that might exactly answer all the exigencies of the commonwealth the best remedy could be find for this defect be to trust this to the prudence of one who be always to be present and whose business it be to watch over the public good constant frequent meet of the legislative and long continuations of their assemblies without necessary occasion could not but be burdensome to the people and must necessarily in time produce more dangerous inconveniencies and yet the quick turn of affairs might be sometimes such as to need their present help any delay of their convene might endanger the public and sometimes too their business might be so great that the limit time of their sit might be too short for their work and rob the public of that benefit which could be have only from their mature deliberation what then could be do in this case to prevent the community from be expose some time or other to imminent hazard on one side or the other by fix intervals and periods set to the meet and act of the legislative but to entrust it to the prudence of some who be present and acquaint with the state of public affairs might make use of this prerogative for the public good and where else could this be so well place as in his hand who be entrust with the execution of the laws for the same end thus suppose the regulation of time for the assemble and sit of the legislative not settle by the original constitution it naturally fell into the hand of the executive not as an arbitrary power depend on his good pleasure but with this trust always to have it exercise only for the public weal as the occurrences of time and change of affairs might require whether settle periods of their convene or a liberty leave to the prince for convoke the legislative or perhaps a mixture of both hath the least inconvenience attend it it be not my business here to inquire but only to show that though the executive power may have the prerogative of convoke and dissolve such conventions of the legislative yet it be not thereby superior to it things of this world be in so constant a flux that nothing remain long in the same state thus people riches trade power change their station flourish mighty cities come to ruin and prove in time neglect desolate corner whilst other unfrequented place grow into populous countries fill with wealth and inhabitants but things not always change equally and private interest often keep up customs and privilege when the reason of them be cease it often come to pass that in governments where part of the legislative consist of repre sentatives choose by the people that in tract of time this representation become very unequal and disproportionate to the reason it be at first establish upon to what gross absurdities the follow of custom when reason have leave it may lead we may be satisfy when we see the bare name of a town of which there remain not so much as the ruin where scarce so much house as a sheepcote or more inhabitants than a shepherd be to be find send as many representatives to the grand assembly of lawmakers as a whole county numerous in people and powerful in riches this strangers stand amaze at and every one must confess need a remedy though most think it hard to find one because the constitution of the legislative be the original and supreme act of the society antecedent to all positive laws in it and depend wholly on the people no inferior power can alter it and therefore the people when the legislative be once constitute have in such a government as we have be speak of no power to act as long as the government stand this inconvenience be think incapable of a remedy salus populi suprema lex be certainly so just and fundamental a rule that he who sincerely follow it can not dangerously err if therefore the executive who have the power of convoke the legislative observe rather the true proportion than fashion of representation regulate not by old custom but true reason the number of members in all place that have a right to be distinctly represent which no part of the people however incorporate can pretend to but in proportion to the assistance which it afford to the public it can not be judge to have set up a new legislative but to have restore the old and true one and to have rectify the disorder which succession of time have insensibly as well as inevitably introduce for it be the interest as well as intention of the people to have a fair and equal representative whoever bring it nearest to that be an undoubted friend to and establisher of the government and can not miss the consent and approbation of the community prerogative be nothing but a power in the hand of the prince to provide for the public good in such case which depend upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences certain and unalterable laws could not safely direct whatsoever shall be do manifestly for the good of the people and establish the government upon its true foundations be and always will be just prerogative the power of erect new corporations and therewith new representatives carry with it a supposition that in time the measure of representation might vary and those have a just right to be represent which before have none and by the same reason those cease to have a right and be too inconsiderable for such a privilege which before have it it be not a change from the present state which perhaps corruption or decay have introduce that make an inroad upon the government but the tendency of it to injure or oppress the people and to set up one part or party with a distinction from and an unequal subjection of the rest whatsoever can not but be acknowledge to be of advantage to the society and people in general upon just and last measure will always when do justify itself and whenever the people shall choose their representatives upon just and undeniably equal measure suitable to the original frame of the government it can not be doubt to be the will and act of the society whoever permit or propose to them so to do of prerogative where the legislative and executive power be in distinct hand as they be in all moderate monarchies and wellframed governments there the good of the society require that several things should be leave to the discretion of him that have the executive power for the legislators not be able to foresee and provide by laws for all that may be useful to the community the executor of the laws have the power in his hand have by the common law of nature a right to make use of it for the good of the society in many case where the municipal law have give no direction till the legislative can conveniently be assemble to provide for it nay many things there be which the law can by no mean provide for and those must necessarily be leave to the discretion of him that have the executive power in his hand to be order by him as the public good and advantage shall require nay it be fit that the laws themselves should in some case give way to the executive power or rather to this fundamental law of nature and governmentviz that as much as may be all the members of the society be to be preserve for since many accidents may happen wherein a strict and rigid observation of the laws may do harm as not to pull down an innocent man house to stop the fire when the next to it be burn and a man may come sometimes within the reach of the law which make no distinction of persons by an action that may deserve reward and pardon it be fit the ruler should have a power in many case to mitigate the severity of the law and pardon some offenders since the end of government be the preservation of all as much as may be even the guilty be to be spar where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent this power to act accord to discretion for the public good without the prescription of the law and sometimes even against it be that which be call prerogative for since in some governments the lawmaking power be not always in be and be usually too numerous and so too slow for the dispatch requisite to execution and because also it be impossible to foresee and so by laws to provide for all accidents and necessities that may concern the public or make such laws as will do no harm if they be execute with an inflexible rigour on all occasion and upon all persons that may come in their way therefore there be a latitude leave to the executive power to do many things of choice which the laws do not prescribe this power whilst employ for the benefit of the community and suitably to the trust and end of the government be undoubted prerogative and never be question for the people be very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the point or question of prerogative whilst it be in any tolerable degree employ for the use it be meantthat be the good of the people and not manifestly against it but if there come to be a question between the executive power and the people about a thing claim as a prerogative the tendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the people will easily decide that question it be easy to conceive that in the infancy of governments when commonwealths differ little from families in number of people they differ from them too but little in number of laws and the governors be as the father of them watch over them for their good the government be almost all prerogative a few establish laws serve the turn and the discretion and care of the ruler supple the rest but when mistake or flattery prevail with weak princes to make use of this power for private end of their own and not for the public good the people be fain by express laws to get prerogative determine in those point wherein they find disadvantage from it and declare limitations of prerogative in those case which they and their ancestors have leave in the utmost latitude to the wisdom of those princes who make no other but a right use of itthat be for the good of their people and therefore they have a very wrong notion of government who say that the people have encroach upon the prerogative when they have get any part of it to be define by positive laws for in so do they have not pull from the prince anything that of right be long to him but only declare that that power which they indefinitely leave in his or his ancestors hand to be exercise for their good be not a thing they intend him when he use it otherwise for the end of government be the good of the community whatsoever alterations be make in it tend to that end can not be an encroachment upon anybody since nobody in government can have a right tend to any other end and those only be encroachments which prejudice or hinder the public good those who say otherwise speak as if the prince have a distinct and separate interest from the good of the community and be not make for it the root and source from which spring almost all those evils and disorder which happen in kingly governments and indeed if that be so the people under his government be not a society of rational creatures enter into a community for their mutual good such as have set rulers over themselves to guard and promote that good but be to be look on as a herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a master who keep them and work them for his own pleasure or profit if men be so void of reason and brutish as to enter into society upon such term prerogative might indeed be what some men would have it an arbitrary power to do things hurtful to the people but since a rational creature can not be suppose when free to put himself into subjection to another for his own harm though where he find a good and a wise ruler he may not perhaps think it either necessary or useful to set precise bound to his power in all things prerogative can be nothing but the people permit their rulers to do several things of their own free choice where the law be silent and sometimes too against the direct letter of the law for the public good and their acquiesce in it when so do for as a good prince who be mindful of the trust put into his hand and careful of the good of his people can not have too much prerogative that be power to do good so a weak and ill prince who would claim that power his predecessors exercise without the direction of the law as a prerogative belong to him by right of his office which he may exercise at his pleasure to make or promote an interest distinct from that of the public give the people an occasion to claim their right and limit that power which whilst it be exercise for their good they be content should be tacitly allow and therefore he that will look into the history of england will find that prerogative be always largest in the hand of our wisest and best princes because the people observe the whole tendency of their action to be the public good or if any human frailty or mistake for princes be but men make as others appear in some small declinations from that end yet it be visible the main of their conduct tend to nothing but the care of the public the people therefore find reason to be satisfy with these princes whenever they act without or contrary to the letter of the law acquiesce in what they do and without the least complaint let them enlarge their prerogative as they please judge rightly that they do nothing herein to the prejudice of their laws since they act conformably to the foundation and end of all lawsthe public good such godlike princes indeed have some title to arbitrary power by that argument that would prove absolute monarchy the best government as that which god himself govern the universe by because such kings partake of his wisdom and goodness upon this be found that say that the reign of good princes have be always most dangerous to the liberties of their people for when their successors manage the government with different thoughts would draw the action of those good rulers into precedent and make them the standard of their prerogativeas if what have be do only for the good of the people be a right in them to do for the harm of the people if they so please it have often occasion contest and sometimes public disorder before the people could recover their original right and get that to be declare not to be prerogative which truly be never so since it be impossible anybody in the society should ever have a right to do the people harm though it be very possible and reasonable that the people should not go about to set any bound to the prerogative of those kings or rulers who themselves transgress not the bound of the public good for prerogative be nothing but the power of do public good without a rule the power of call parliaments in england as to precise time place and duration be certainly a prerogative of the king but still with this trust that it shall be make use of for the good of the nation as the exigencies of the time and variety of occasion shall require for it be impossible to foresee which should always be the fittest place for them to assemble in and what the best season the choice of these be leave with the executive power as might be best subservient to the public good and best suit the end of parliament the old question will be ask in this matter of prerogative but who shall be judge when this power be make a right use of i answer between an executive power in be with such a prerogative and a legislative that depend upon his will for their convene there can be no judge on earth as there can be none between the legislative and the people should either the executive or the legislative when they have get the power in their hand design or go about to enslave or destroy them the people have no other remedy in this as in all other case where they have no judge on earth but to appeal to heaven for the rulers in such attempt exercise a power the people never put into their hand who can never be suppose to consent that anybody should rule over them for their harm do that which they have not a right to do and where the body of the people or any single man be deprive of their right or be under the exercise of a power without right have no appeal on earth they have a liberty to appeal to heaven whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment and therefore though the people can not be judge so as to have by the constitution of that society any superior power to determine and give effective sentence in the case yet they have reserve that ultimate determination to themselves which belong to all mankind where there lie no appeal on earth by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven and this judgement they can not part with it be out of a man power so to submit himself to another as to give him a liberty to destroy him god and nature never allow a man so to abandon himself as to neglect his own preservation and since he can not take away his own life neither can he give another power to take it nor let any one think this lay a perpetual foundation for disorder for this operate not till the inconvenience be so great that the majority feel it and be weary of it and find a necessity to have it amend and this the executive power or wise princes never need come in the danger of and it be the thing of all others they have most need to avoid as of all others the most perilous of paternal political and despotical power consider together though i have have occasion to speak of these separately before yet the great mistake of late about government have as i suppose arise from confound these distinct power one with another it may not perhaps be amiss to consider them here together first then paternal or parental power be nothing but that which parent have over their children to govern them for the childrens good till they come to the use of reason or a state of knowledge wherein they may be suppose capable to understand that rule whether it be the law of nature or the municipal law of their country they be to govern themselves bycapable i say to know it as well as several others who live as free men under that law the affection and tenderness god hath plant in the breast of parent towards their children make it evident that this be not intend to be a severe arbitrary government but only for the help instruction and preservation of their offspring but happen as it will there be as i have prove no reason why it should be think to extend to life and death at any time over their children more than over anybody else or keep the child in subjection to the will of his parent when grow to a man and the perfect use of reason any farther than as have receive life and education from his parent oblige him to respect honour gratitude assistance and support all his life to both father and mother and thus it be true the paternal be a natural government but not at all extend itself to the end and jurisdictions of that which be political the power of the father doth not reach at all to the property of the child which be only in his own dispose secondly political power be that power which every man have in the state of nature have give up into the hand of the society and therein to the governors whom the society hath set over itself with this express or tacit trust that it shall be employ for their good and the preservation of their property now this power which every man have in the state of nature and which he part with to the society in all such case where the society can secure him be to use such mean for the preserve of his own property as he think good and nature allow him and to punish the breach of the law of nature in others so as accord to the best of his reason may most conduce to the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind so that the end and measure of this power when in every man hand in the state of nature be the preservation of all of his societythat be all mankind in generalit can have no other end or measure when in the hand of the magistrate but to preserve the members of that society in their live liberties and possessions and so can not be an absolute arbitrary power over their live and fortunes which be as much as possible to be preserve but a power to make laws and annex such penalties to them as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cut off those part and those only which be so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy without which no severity be lawful and this power have its original only from compact and agreement and the mutual consent of those who make up the community thirdly despotical power be an absolute arbitrary power one man have over another to take away his life whenever he please and this be a power which neither nature give for it have make no such distinction between one man and another nor compact can convey for man not have such an arbitrary power over his own life can not give another man such a power over it but it be the effect only of forfeiture which the aggressor make of his own life when he put himself into the state of war with another for have quit reason which god hath give to be the rule betwixt man and man and the peaceable ways which that teach and make use of force to compass his unjust end upon another where he have no right he render himself liable to be destroy by his adversary whenever he can as any other noxious and brutish creature that be destructive to his be and thus captives take in a just and lawful war and such only be subject to a despotical power which as it arise not from compact so neither be it capable of any but be the state of war continue for what compact can be make with a man that be not master of his own life what condition can he perform and if he be once allow to be master of his own life the despotical arbitrary power of his master cease he that be master of himself and his own life have a right too to the mean of preserve it so that as soon as compact enter slavery cease and he so far quit his absolute power and put an end to the state of war who enter into condition with his captive nature give the first of theseviz paternal power to parent for the benefit of their children during their minority to supply their want of ability and understand how to manage their property by property i must be understand here as in other place to mean that property which men have in their persons as well as goods voluntary agreement give the secondviz political power to governors for the benefit of their subject to secure them in the possession and use of their properties and forfeiture give the thirddespotical power to lord for their own benefit over those who be strip of all property he that shall consider the distinct rise and extent and the different end of these several power will plainly see that paternal power come as far short of that of the magistrate as despotical exceed it and that absolute dominion however place be so far from be one kind of civil society that it be as inconsistent with it as slavery be with property paternal power be only where minority make the child incapable to manage his property political where men have property in their own disposal and despotical over such as have no property at all of conquest though governments can originally have no other rise than that before mention nor polities be found on anything but the consent of the people yet such have be the disorder ambition have fill the world with that in the noise of war which make so great a part of the history of mankind this consent be little take notice of and therefore many have mistake the force of arm for the consent of the people and reckon conquest as one of the originals of government but conquest be as far from set up any government as demolish a house be from build a new one in the place indeed it often make way for a new frame of a commonwealth by destroy the former but without the consent of the people can never erect a new one that the aggressor who put himself into the state of war with another and unjustly invade another man right can by such an unjust war never come to have a right over the conquer will be easily agree by all men who will not think that robbers and pirate have a right of empire over whomsoever they have force enough to master or that men be bind by promise which unlawful force extort from them should a robber break into my house and with a dagger at my throat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him would this give him any title just such a title by his sword have an unjust conqueror who force me into submission the injury and the crime be equal whether commit by the wearer of a crown or some petty villain the title of the offender and the number of his followers make no difference in the offence unless it be to aggravate it the only difference be great robbers punish little ones to keep them in their obedience but the great ones be reward with laurels and triumph because they be too big for the weak hand of justice in this world and have the power in their own possession which should punish offenders what be my remedy against a robber that so break into my house appeal to the law for justice but perhaps justice be deny or i be cripple and can not stir rob and have not the mean to do it if god have take away all mean of seek remedy there be nothing leave but patience but my son when able may seek the relief of the law which i be deny he or his son may renew his appeal till he recover his right but the conquer or their children have no courtno arbitrator on earth to appeal to then they may appeal as jephtha do to heaven and repeat their appeal till they have recover the native right of their ancestors which be to have such a legislative over them as the majority should approve and freely acquiesce in if it be object this would cause endless trouble i answer no more than justice do where she lie open to all that appeal to her he that trouble his neighbour without a cause be punish for it by the justice of the court he appeal to and he that appeal to heaven must be sure he have right on his side and a right too that be worth the trouble and cost of the appeal as he will answer at a tribunal that can not be deceive and will be sure to retribute to every one accord to the mischiefs he hath create to his fellowsubjectsthat be any part of mankind from whence it be plain that he that conquer in an unjust war can thereby have no title to the subjection and obedience of the conquer but suppose victory favour the right side let us consider a conqueror in a lawful war and see what power he get and over whom first it be plain he get no power by his conquest over those that conquer with him they that fight on his side can not suffer by the conquest but must at least be as much free men as they be before and most commonly they serve upon term and on condition to share with their leader and enjoy a part of the spoil and other advantage that attend the conquer sword or at least have a part of the subdue country bestow upon them and the conquer people be not i hope to be slave by conquest and wear their laurels only to show they be sacrifice to their leaders triumph they that find absolute monarchy upon the title of the sword make their heroes who be the founder of such monarchies arrant drawcansirs and forget they have any officer and soldier that fight on their side in the battle they win or assist them in the subdue or share in possess the countries they master we be tell by some that the english monarchy be found in the norman conquest and that our princes have thereby a title to absolute dominion which if it be true as by the history it appear otherwise and that william have a right to make war on this island yet his dominion by conquest could reach no farther than to the saxons and britons that be then inhabitants of this country the normans that come with him and help to conquer and all descend from them be free men and no subject by conquest let that give what dominion it will and if i or anybody else shall claim freedom as derive from them it will be very hard to prove the contrary and it be plain the law that have make no distinction between the one and the other intend not there should be any difference in their freedom or privilege but suppose which seldom happen that the conquerors and conquer never incorporate into one people under the same laws and freedom let us see next what power a lawful conqueror have over the subdue and that i say be purely despotical he have an absolute power over the live of those who by an unjust war have forfeit them but not over the live or fortunes of those who engage not in the war nor over the possessions even of those who be actually engage in it secondly i say then the conqueror get no power but only over those who have actually assist concur or consent to that unjust force that be use against him for the people have give to their governors no power to do an unjust thing such as be to make an unjust war for they never have such a power in themselves they ought not to be charge as guilty of the violence and injustice that be commit in an unjust war any farther than they actually abet it no more than they be to be think guilty of any violence or oppression their governors should use upon the people themselves or any part of their fellowsubjects they have empower them no more to the one than to the other conquerors it be true seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction but they willingly permit the confusion of war to sweep all together but yet this alter not the right for the conquerors power over the live of the conquer be only because they have use force to do or maintain an injustice he can have that power only over those who have concur in that force all the rest be innocent and he have no more title over the people of that country who have do him no injury and so have make no forfeiture of their live than he have over any other who without any injuries or provocations have live upon fair term with him thirdly the power a conqueror get over those he overcome in a just war be perfectly despotical he have an absolute power over the live of those who by put themselves in a state of war have forfeit them but he have not thereby a right and title to their possessions this i doubt not but at first sight will seem a strange doctrine it be so quite contrary to the practice of the world there be nothing more familiar in speak of the dominion of countries than to say such an one conquer it as if conquest without any more ado convey a right of possession but when we consider that the practice of the strong and powerful how universal soever it may be be seldom the rule of right however it be one part of the subjection of the conquer not to argue against the condition cut out to them by the conquer swords though in all war there be usually a complication of force and damage and the aggressor seldom fail to harm the estate when he use force against the persons of those he make war upon yet it be the use of force only that put a man into the state of war for whether by force he begin the injury or else have quietly and by fraud do the injury he refuse to make reparation and by force maintain it which be the same thing as at first to have do it by force it be the unjust use of force that make the war for he that break open my house and violently turn me out of doors or have peaceably get in by force keep me out do in effect the same thing suppose we be in such a state that we have no common judge on earth whom i may appeal to and to whom we be both oblige to submit for of such i be now speak it be the unjust use of force then that put a man into the state of war with another and thereby he that be guilty of it make a forfeiture of his life for quit reason which be the rule give between man and man and use force the way of beasts he become liable to be destroy by him he use force against as any savage ravenous beast that be dangerous to his be but because the miscarriages of the father be no fault of the children who may be rational and peaceable notwithstanding the brutishness and injustice of the father the father by his miscarriages and violence can forfeit but his own life and involve not his children in his guilt or destruction his goods which nature that willeth the preservation of all mankind as much as be possible hath make to belong to the children to keep them from perish do still continue to belong to his children for suppose them not to have join in the war either through infancy or choice they have do nothing to forfeit them nor have the conqueror any right to take them away by the bare right of have subdue him that by force attempt his destruction though perhaps he may have some right to them to repair the damage he have sustain by the war and the defence of his own right which how far it reach to the possessions of the conquer we shall see byandby so that he that by conquest have a right over a man person to destroy him if he please have not thereby a right over his estate to possess and enjoy it for it be the brutal force the aggressor have use that give his adversary a right to take away his life and destroy him if he please as a noxious creature but it be damage sustain that alone give him title to another man goods for though i may kill a thief that set on me in the highway yet i may not which seem less take away his money and let him go this would be robbery on my side his force and the state of war he put himself in make him forfeit his life but give me no title to his goods the right then of conquest extend only to the live of those who join in the war but not to their estates but only in order to make reparation for the damage receive and the charge of the war and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and children let the conqueror have as much justice on his side as could be suppose he have no right to seize more than the vanquish could forfeit his life be at the victors mercy and his service and goods he may appropriate to make himself reparation but he can not take the goods of his wife and children they too have a title to the goods he enjoy and their share in the estate he possess for example i in the state of nature and all commonwealths be in the state of nature one with another have injure another man and refuse to give satisfaction it be come to a state of war wherein my defend by force what i have get unjustly make me the aggressor i be conquer my life it be true as forfeit be at mercy but not my wifes and childrens they make not the war nor assist in it i could not forfeit their live they be not mine to forfeit my wife have a share in my estate that neither could i forfeit and my children also be bear of me have a right to be maintain out of my labour or substance here then be the case the conqueror have a title to reparation for damage receive and the children have a title to their father estate for their subsistence for as to the wifes share whether her own labour or compact give her a title to it it be plain her husband could not forfeit what be hers what must be do in the case i answer the fundamental law of nature be that all as much as may be should be preserve it follow that if there be not enough fully to satisfy bothviz for the conquerors losses and childrens maintenance he that hath and to spare must remit something of his full satisfaction and give way to the press and preferable title of those who be in danger to perish without it but suppose the charge and damage of the war be to be make up to the conqueror to the utmost farthing and that the children of the vanquish spoil of all their father goods be to be leave to starve and perish yet the satisfy of what shall on this score be due to the conqueror will scarce give him a title to any country he shall conquer for the damage of war can scarce amount to the value of any considerable tract of land in any part of the world where all the land be possess and none lie waste and if i have not take away the conquerors land which be vanquish it be impossible i should scarce any other spoil i have do him can amount to the value of mine suppose it of an extent any way come near what i have overrun of his and equally cultivate too the destruction of a years product or two for it seldom reach four or five be the utmost spoil that usually can be do for as to money and such riches and treasure take away these be none of natures goods they have but a phantastical imaginary value nature have put no such upon them they be of no more account by her standard than the wampompeke of the americans to an european prince or the silver money of europe would have be formerly to an american and five years product be not worth the perpetual inheritance of land where all be possess and none remain waste to be take up by him that be disseised which will be easily grant if one do but take away the imaginary value of money the disproportion be more than between five and five thousand though at the same time half a years product be more worth than the inheritance where there be more land than the inhabitants possess and make use of any one have liberty to make use of the waste but their conquerors take little care to possess themselves of the land of the vanquish no damage therefore that men in the state of nature as all princes and governments be in reference to one another suffer from one another can give a conqueror power to dispossess the posterity of the vanquish and turn them out of that inheritance which ought to be the possession of them and their descendants to all generations the conqueror indeed will be apt to think himself master and it be the very condition of the subdue not to be able to dispute their right but if that be all it give no other title than what bare force give to the stronger over the weaker and by this reason he that be strongest will have a right to whatever he please to seize on over those then that join with him in the war and over those of the subdue country that oppose him not and the posterity even of those that do the conqueror even in a just war hath by his conquest no right of dominion they be free from any subjection to him and if their former government be dissolve they be at liberty to begin and erect another to themselves the conqueror it be true usually by the force he have over them compel them with a sword at their breast to stoop to his condition and submit to such a government as he please to afford them but the inquiry be what right he have to do so if it be say they submit by their own consent then this allow their own consent to be necessary to give the conqueror a title to rule over them it remain only to be consider whether promise extort by force without right can be think consent and how far they bind to which i shall say they bind not at all because whatsoever another get from me by force i still retain the right of and he be oblige presently to restore he that force my horse from me ought presently to restore him and i have still a right to retake him by the same reason he that force a promise from me ought presently to restore itie quit me of the obligation of it or i may resume it myselfie choose whether i will perform it for the law of nature lay an obligation on me only by the rule she prescribe can not oblige me by the violation of her rule such be the extort anything from me by force nor do it at all alter the case to say i give my promise no more than it excuse the force and pass the right when i put my hand in my pocket and deliver my purse myself to a thief who demand it with a pistol at my breast from all which it follow that the government of a conqueror impose by force on the subdue against whom he have no right of war or who join not in the war against him where he have right have no obligation upon them but let us suppose that all the men of that community be all members of the same body politic may be take to have join in that unjust war wherein they be subdue and so their live be at the mercy of the conqueror i say this concern not their children who be in their minority for since a father hath not in himself a power over the life or liberty of his child no act of his can possibly forfeit it so that the children whatever may have happen to the father be free men and the absolute power of the conqueror reach no farther than the persons of the men that be subdue by him and die with them and should he govern them as slave subject to his absolute arbitrary power he have no such right of dominion over their children he can have no power over them but by their own consent whatever he may drive them to say or do and he have no lawful authority whilst force and not choice compel them to submission every man be bear with a double right first a right of freedom to his person which no other man have a power over but the free disposal of it lie in himself secondly a right before any other man to inherit with his brethren his father goods by the first of these a man be naturally free from subjection to any government though he be bear in a place under its jurisdiction but if he disclaim the lawful government of the country he be bear in he must also quit the right that belong to him by the laws of it and the possessions there descend to him from his ancestors if it be a government make by their consent by the second the inhabitants of any country who be descend and derive a title to their estates from those who be subdue and have a government force upon them against their free consent retain a right to the possession of their ancestors though they consent not freely to the government whose hard condition be by force impose on the possessors of that country for the first conqueror never have have a title to the land of that country the people who be the descendants of or claim under those who be force to submit to the yoke of a government by constraint have always a right to shake it off and free themselves from the usurpation or tyranny the sword hath bring in upon them till their rulers put them under such a frame of government as they willingly and of choice consent to which they can never be suppose to do till either they be put in a full state of liberty to choose their government and governors or at least till they have such stand laws to which they have by themselves or their representatives give their free consent and also till they be allow their due property which be so to be proprietors of what they have that nobody can take away any part of it without their own consent without which men under any government be not in the state of free men but be direct slave under the force of war and who doubt but the grecian christians descendants of the ancient possessors of that country may justly cast off the turkish yoke they have so long groan under whenever they have a power to do it but grant that the conqueror in a just war have a right to the estates as well as power over the persons of the conquer which it be plain he hath not nothing of absolute power will follow from hence in the continuance of the government because the descendants of these be all free men if he grant them estates and possessions to inhabit his country without which it would be worth nothing whatsoever he grant them they have so far as it be grant property in the nature whereof be that without a man own consent it can not be take from him their persons be free by a native right and their properties be they more or less be their own and at their own dispose and not at his or else it be no property suppose the conqueror give to one man a thousand acres to him and his heirs for ever to another he let a thousand acres for his life under the rent of l or l per annum have not the one of these a right to his thousand acres for ever and the other during his life pay the say rent and hath not the tenant for life a property in all that he get over and above his rent by his labour and industry during the say term suppose it be double the rent can any one say the king or conqueror after his grant may by his power of conqueror take away all or part of the land from the heirs of one or from the other during his life he pay the rent or can he take away from either the goods or money they have get upon the say land at his pleasure if he can then all free and voluntary contract cease and be void in the world there need nothing but power enough to dissolve them at any time and all the grant and promise of men in power be but mockery and collusion for can there be anything more ridiculous than to say i give you and yours this for ever and that in the surest and most solemn way of conveyance can be devise and yet it be to be understand that i have right if i please to take it away from you again tomorrow i will not dispute now whether princes be exempt from the laws of their country but this i be sure they owe subjection to the laws of god and nature nobody no power can exempt them from the obligations of that eternal law those be so great and so strong in the case of promise that omnipotency itself can be tie by them grant promise and oaths be bond that hold the almighty whatever some flatterers say to princes of the world who all together with all their people join to them be in comparison of the great god but as a drop of the bucket or a dust on the balance inconsiderable nothing the short of the case in conquest be this the conqueror if he have a just cause have a despotical right over the persons of all that actually aid and concur in the war against him and a right to make up his damage and cost out of their labour and estates so he injure not the right of any other over the rest of the people if there be any that consent not to the war and over the children of the captives them selves or the possessions of either he have no power and so can have by virtue of conquest no lawful title himself to dominion over them or derive it to his posterity but be an aggressor and put himself in a state of war against them and have no better a right of principality he nor any of his successors than hingar or hubba the danes have here in england or spartacus have be conquer italy which be to have their yoke cast off as soon as god shall give those under their subjection courage and opportunity to do it thus notwithstanding whatever title the kings of assyria have over judah by the sword god assist hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquer empire and the lord be with hezekiah and he prosper wherefore he go forth and he rebel against the king of assyria and serve him not ii kings whence it be plain that shake off a power which force and not right hath set over any one though it hath the name of rebellion yet be no offence before god but that which he allow and countenance though even promise and covenant when obtain by force have intervene for it be very probable to any one that read the story of ahaz and hezekiah attentively that the assyrians subdue ahaz and depose him and make hezekiah king in his father lifetime and that hezekiah by agreement have do him homage and pay him tribute till this time of usurpation as conquest may be call a foreign usurpation so usurpation be a kind of domestic conquest with this differencethat an usurper can never have right on his side it be no usurpation but where one be get into the possession of what another have right to this so far as it be usurpation be a change only of persons but not of the form and rule of the government for if the usurper extend his power beyond what of right belong to the lawful princes or governors of the commonwealth it be tyranny add to usurpation in all lawful governments the designation of the persons who be to bear rule be as natural and necessary a part as the form of the government itself and that which have its establishment originally from the peoplethe anarchy be much alike to have no form of government at all or to agree that it shall be monarchical yet appoint no way to design the person that shall have the power and be the monarchall commonwealths therefore with the form of government establish have rule also of appoint and convey the right to those who be to have any share in the public authority and whoever get into the exercise of any part of the power by other ways than what the laws of the community have prescribe hath no right to be obey though the form of the commonwealth be still preserve since he be not the person the laws have appoint and consequently not the person the people have consent to nor can such an usurper or any derive from him ever have a title till the people be both at liberty to consent and have actually consent to allow and confirm in him the power he hath till then usurp of tyranny as usurpation be the exercise of power which another hath a right to so tyranny be the exercise of power beyond right which nobody can have a right to and this be make use of the power any one have in his hand not for the good of those who be under it but for his own private separate advantage when the governor however entitle make not the law but his will the rule and his command and action be not direct to the preservation of the properties of his people but the satisfaction of his own ambition revenge covetousness or any other irregular passion if one can doubt this to be truth or reason because it come from the obscure hand of a subject i hope the authority of a king will make it pass with him king jam in his speech to the parliament tell them thus i will ever prefer the weal of the public and of the whole commonwealth in make of good laws and constitutions to any particular and private end of mine think ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly felicitya point wherein a lawful king doth directly differ from a tyrant for i do acknowledge that the special and greatest point of difference that be between a rightful king and an usurp tyrant be thisthat whereas the proud and ambitious tyrant doth think his kingdom and people be only ordain for satisfaction of his desire and unreasonable appetites the righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordain for the procure of the wealth and property of his people and again in his speech to the parliament he hath these word the king bind himself by a double oath to the observation of the fundamental laws of his kingdomtacitly as by be a king and so bind to protect as well the people as the laws of his kingdom and expressly by his oath at his coronation so as every just king in a settle kingdom be bind to observe that paction make to his people by his laws in frame his government agreeable thereunto accord to that paction which god make with noah after the deluge hereafter seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease while the earth remaineth and therefore a king govern in a settle kingdom leave to be a king and degenerate into a tyrant as soon as he leave off to rule accord to his laws and a little after therefore all kings that be not tyrants or perjure will be glad to bind themselves within the limit of their laws and they that persuade them the contrary be vipers pests both against them and the commonwealth thus that learn king who well understand the notions of things make the difference betwixt a king and a tyrant to consist only in this that one make the laws the bound of his power and the good of the public the end of his government the other make all give way to his own will and appetite it be a mistake to think this fault be proper only to monarchies other form of government be liable to it as well as that for wherever the power that be put in any hand for the government of the people and the preservation of their properties be apply to other end and make use of to impoverish harass or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular command of those that have it there it presently become tyranny whether those that thus use it be one or many thus we read of the thirty tyrants at athens as well as one at syracuse and the intolerable dominion of the decemviri at rome be nothing better wherever law end tyranny begin if the law be transgress to anothers harm and whosoever in authority exceed the power give him by the law and make use of the force he have under his command to compass that upon the subject which the law allow not cease in that to be a magistrate and act without authority may be oppose as any other man who by force invade the right of another this be acknowledge in subordinate magistrates he that hath authority to seize my person in the street may be oppose as a thief and a robber if he endeavour to break into my house to execute a writ notwithstanding that i know he have such a warrant and such a legal authority as will empower him to arrest me abroad and why this should not hold in the highest as well as in the most inferior magistrate i would gladly be inform be it reasonable that the eldest brother because he have the greatest part of his father estate should thereby have a right to take away any of his younger brothers portion or that a rich man who possess a whole country should from thence have a right to seize when he please the cottage and garden of his poor neighbour the be rightfully possess of great power and riches exceedingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of adam be so far from be an excuse much less a reason for rapine and oppression which the endamaging another without authority be that it be a great aggravation of it for exceed the bound of authority be no more a right in a great than a petty officer no more justifiable in a king than a constable but so much the worse in him as that he have more trust put in him be suppose from the advantage of education and counsellors to have better knowledge and less reason to do it have already a greater share than the rest of his brethren may the command then of a prince be oppose may he be resist as often as any one shall find himself aggrieve and but imagine he have not right do him this will unhinge and overturn all polities and instead of government and order leave nothing but anarchy and confusion to this i answer that force be to be oppose to nothing but to unjust and unlawful force whoever make any opposition in any other case draw on himself a just condemnation both from god and man and so no such danger or confusion will follow as be often suggest for first as in some countries the person of the prince by the law be sacred and so whatever he command or do his person be still free from all question or violence not liable to force or any judicial censure or condemnation but yet opposition may be make to the illegal act of any inferior officer or other commission by him unless he will by actually put himself into a state of war with his people dissolve the government and leave them to that defence which belong to every one in the state of nature for of such things who can tell what the end will be and a neighbour kingdom have show the world an odd example in all other case the sacredness of the person exempt him from all inconveniencies whereby he be secure whilst the government stand from all violence and harm whatsoever than which there can not be a wiser constitution for the harm he can do in his own person not be likely to happen often nor to extend itself far nor be able by his single strength to subvert the laws nor oppress the body of the people should any prince have so much weakness and illnature as to be will to do it the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs that may happen sometimes when a heady prince come to the throne be well recompense by the peace of the public and security of the government in the person of the chief magistrate thus set out of the reach of danger it be safer for the body that some few private men should be sometimes in danger to suffer than that the head of the republic should be easily and upon slight occasion expose secondly but this privilege belong only to the kings person hinder not but they may be question oppose and resist who use unjust force though they pretend a commission from him which the law authorise not as be plain in the case of him that have the kings writ to arrest a man which be a full commission from the king and yet he that have it can not break open a man house to do it nor execute this command of the king upon certain days nor in certain place though this commission have no such exception in it but they be the limitations of the law which if any one transgress the kings commission excuse him not for the kings authority be give him only by the law he can not empower any one to act against the law or justify him by his commission in so do the commission or command of any magistrate where he have no authority be as void and insignificant as that of any private man the difference between the one and the other be that the magistrate have some authority so far and to such end and the private man have none at all for it be not the commission but the authority that give the right of act and against the laws there can be no authority but notwithstanding such resistance the kings person and authority be still both secure and so no danger to governor or government thirdly suppose a government wherein the person of the chief magistrate be not thus sacred yet this doctrine of the lawfulness of resist all unlawful exercise of his power will not upon every slight occasion endanger him or embroil the government for where the injure party may be relieve and his damage repair by appeal to the law there can be no pretence for force which be only to be use where a man be intercept from appeal to the law for nothing be to be account hostile force but where it leave not the remedy of such an appeal and it be such force alone that put him that use it into a state of war and make it lawful to resist him a man with a sword in his hand demand my purse on the highway when perhaps i have not d in my pocket this man i may lawfully kill to another i deliver to hold only whilst i alight which he refuse to restore me when i be get up again but draw his sword to defend the possession of it by force i endeavour to retake it the mischief this man do me be a hundred or possibly a thousand time more than the other perhaps intend me whom i kill before he really do me any and yet i might lawfully kill the one and can not so much as hurt the other lawfully the reason whereof be plain because the one use force which threaten my life i could not have time to appeal to the law to secure it and when it be go it be too late to appeal the law could not restore life to my dead carcass the loss be irreparable which to prevent the law of nature give me a right to destroy him who have put himself into a state of war with me and threaten my destruction but in the other case my life not be in danger i might have the benefit of appeal to the law and have reparation for my that way fourthly but if the unlawful act do by the magistrate be maintain by the power he have get and the remedy which be due by law be by the same power obstruct yet the right of resist even in such manifest act of tyranny will not suddenly or on slight occasion disturb the government for if it reach no farther than some private mens case though they have a right to defend themselves and to recover by force what by unlawful force be take from them yet the right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest wherein they be sure to perish it be as impossible for one or a few oppress men to disturb the government where the body of the people do not think themselves concern in it as for a rave madman or heady malcontent to overturn a wellsettled state the people be as little apt to follow the one as the other but if either these illegal act have extend to the majority of the people or if the mischief and oppression have light only on some few but in such case as the precedent and consequences seem to threaten all and they be persuade in their consciences that their laws and with them their estates liberties and live be in danger and perhaps their religion too how they will be hinder from resist illegal force use against them i can not tell this be an inconvenience i confess that attend all governments whatsoever when the governors have bring it to this pass to be generally suspect of their people the most dangerous state they can possibly put themselves in wherein they be the less to be pity because it be so easy to be avoid it be as impossible for a governor if he really mean the good of his people and the preser vation of them and their laws together not to make them see and feel it as it be for the father of a family not to let his children see he love and take care of them but if all the world shall observe pretences of one kind and action of another arts use to elude the law and the trust of prerogative which be an arbitrary power in some things leave in the princes hand to do good not harm to the people employ contrary to the end for which it be give if the people shall find the minister and subordinate magistrates choose suitable to such end and favour or lay by proportionably as they promote or oppose them if they see several experiment make of arbitrary power and that religion underhand favour though publicly proclaim against which be readiest to introduce it and the operators in it support as much as may be and when that can not be do yet approve still and like the better and a long train of act show the counsel all tend that way how can a man any more hinder himself from be persuade in his own mind which way things be go or from cast about how to save himself than he could from believe the captain of a ship he be in be carry him and the rest of the company to algiers when he find him always steer that course though cross wind leak in his ship and want of men and provision do often force him to turn his course another way for some time which he steadily return to again as soon as the wind weather and other circumstances would let him of the dissolution of government he that will with any clearness speak of the dissolution of government ought in the first place to distinguish between the dissolution of the society and the dissolution of the government that which make the community and bring men out of the loose state of nature into one politic society be the agreement which every one have with the rest to incorporate and act as one body and so be one distinct commonwealth the usual and almost only way whereby this union be dissolve be the inroad of foreign force make a conquest upon them for in that case not be able to maintain and support themselves as one entire and independent body the union belong to that body which consist therein must necessarily cease and so every one return to the state he be in before with a liberty to shift for himself and provide for his own safety as he think fit in some other society whenever the society be dissolve it be certain the government of that society can not remain thus conquerors swords often cut up governments by the root and mangle societies to piece separate the subdue or scatter multitude from the protection of and dependence on that society which ought to have preserve them from violence the world be too well instruct in and too forward to allow of this way of dissolve of governments to need any more to be say of it and there want not much argument to prove that where the society be dissolve the government can not remain that be as impossible as for the frame of a house to subsist when the materials of it be scatter and displace by a whirlwind or jumble into a confuse heap by an earthquake besides this overturn from without governments be dissolve from within first when the legislative be alter civil society be a state of peace amongst those who be of it from whom the state of war be exclude by the umpirage which they have provide in their legislative for the end all differences that may arise amongst any of them it be in their legislative that the members of a commonwealth be unite and combine together into one coherent live body this be the soul that give form life and unity to the commonwealth from hence the several members have their mutual influence sympathy and connection and therefore when the legislative be break or dissolve dissolution and death follow for the essence and union of the society consist in have one will the legislative when once establish by the majority have the declare and as it be keep of that will the constitution of the legislative be the first and fundamental act of society whereby provision be make for the continuation of their union under the direction of persons and bond of laws make by persons authorise thereunto by the consent and appointment of the people without which no one man or number of men amongst them can have authority of make laws that shall be bind to the rest when any one or more shall take upon them to make laws whom the people have not appoint so to do they make laws without authority which the people be not therefore bind to obey by which mean they come again to be out of subjection and may constitute to themselves a new legislative as they think best be in full liberty to resist the force of those who without authority would impose anything upon them every one be at the disposure of his own will when those who have by the delegation of the society the declare of the public will be exclude from it and others usurp the place who have no such authority or delegation this be usually bring about by such in the commonwealth who misuse the power they have it be hard to consider it aright and know at whose door to lay it without know the form of government in which it happen let us suppose then the legislative place in the concurrence of three distinct persons first a single hereditary person have the constant supreme executive power and with it the power of convoke and dissolve the other two within certain periods of time secondly an assembly of hereditary nobility thirdly an assembly of representatives choose pro tempore by the people such a form of government suppose it be evident first that when such a single person or prince set up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws which be the will of the society declare by the legislative then the legislative be change for that be in effect the legislative whose rule and laws be put in execution and require to be obey when other laws be set up and other rule pretend and enforce than what the legislative constitute by the society have enact it be plain that the legislative be change whoever introduce new laws not be thereunto authorise by the fundamental appointment of the society or subvert the old disown and overturn the power by which they be make and so set up a new legislative secondly when the prince hinder the legislative from assemble in its due time or from act freely pursuant to those end for which it be constitute the legislative be alter for it be not a certain number of menno nor their meet unless they have also freedom of debate and leisure of perfect what be for the good of the society wherein the legislative consist when these be take away or alter so as to deprive the society of the due exercise of their power the legislative be truly alter for it be not name that constitute governments but the use and exercise of those power that be intend to accompany them so that he who take away the freedom or hinder the act of the legislative in its due season in effect take away the legislative and put an end to the government thirdly when by the arbitrary power of the prince the electors or ways of election be alter without the consent and contrary to the common interest of the people there also the legislative be alter for if others than those whom the society hath authorise thereunto do choose or in another way than what the society hath prescribe those choose be not the legislative appoint by the people fourthly the delivery also of the people into the subjection of a foreign power either by the prince or by the legislative be certainly a change of the legislative and so a dissolution of the government for the end why people enter into society be to be preserve one entire free independent society to be govern by its own laws this be lose whenever they be give up into the power of another why in such a constitution as this the dissolution of the government in these case be to be impute to the prince be evident because he have the force treasure and offices of the state to employ and often persuade himself or be flatter by others that as supreme magistrate he be incapable of control he alone be in a condition to make great advance towards such change under pretence of lawful authority and have it in his hand to terrify or suppress opposers as factious seditious and enemies to the government whereas no other part of the legislative or people be capable by themselves to attempt any alteration of the legislative without open and visible rebellion apt enough to be take notice of which when it prevail produce effect very little different from foreign conquest besides the prince in such a form of government have the power of dissolve the other part of the legislative and thereby render them private persons they can never in opposition to him or without his concurrence alter the legislative by a law his consent be necessary to give any of their decree that sanction but yet so far as the other part of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the government and do either promote or not what lie in them hinder such design they be guilty and partake in this which be certainly the greatest crime men can be guilty of one towards another there be one way more whereby such a government may be dissolve and that be when he who have the supreme executive power neglect and abandon that charge so that the laws already make can no longer be put in execution this be demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy and so effectively to dissolve the government for laws not be make for themselves but to be by their execution the bond of the society to keep every part of the body politic in its due place and function when that totally cease the government visibly cease and the people become a confuse multitude without order or connection where there be no longer the administration of justice for the secure of mens right nor any remain power within the community to direct the force or provide for the necessities of the public there certainly be no govern ment leave where the laws can not be execute it be all one as if there be no laws and a government without laws be i suppose a mystery in politics inconceivable to human capacity and inconsistent with human society in these and the like case when the government be dissolve the people be at liberty to provide for themselves by erect a new legislative differ from the other by the change of persons or form or both as they shall find it most for their safety and good for the society can never by the fault of another lose the native and original right it have to preserve itself which can only be do by a settle legislative and a fair and impartial execution of the laws make by it but the state of mankind be not so miserable that they be not capable of use this remedy till it be too late to look for any to tell people they may provide for themselves by erect a new legislative when by oppression artifice or be deliver over to a foreign power their old one be go be only to tell them they may expect relief when it be too late and the evil be past cure this be in effect no more than to bid them first be slave and then to take care of their liberty and when their chain be on tell them they may act like free men this if barely so be rather mockery than relief and men can never be secure from tyranny if there be no mean to escape it till they be perfectly under it and therefore it be that they have not only a right to get out of it but to prevent it there be therefore secondly another way whereby governments be dissolve and that be when the legislative or the prince either of them act contrary to their trust for the legislative act against the trust repose in them when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject and to make themselves or any part of the community master or arbitrary disposers of the live liberties or fortunes of the people the reason why men enter into society be the preservation of their property and the end while they choose and authorise a legislative be that there may be laws make and rule set as guard and fence to the properties of all the society to limit the power and moderate the dominion of every part and member of the society for since it can never be suppose to be the will of the society that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one design to secure by enter into society and for which the people submit themselves to legislators of their own make whenever the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people or to reduce them to sla very under arbitrary power they put themselves into a state of war with the people who be thereupon absolve from any farther obedience and be leave to the common refuge which god hath provide for all men against force and violence whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavour to grasp themselves or put into the hand of any other an absolute power over the live liberties and estates of the people by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people have put into their hand for quite contrary end and it devolve to the people who have a right to resume their original liberty and by the establishment of a new legislative such as they shall think fit provide for their own safety and security which be the end for which they be in society what i have say here concern the legislative in general hold true also concern the supreme executor who have a double trust put in him both to have a part in the legislative and the supreme execution of the law act against both when he go about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society he act also contrary to his trust when he employ the force treasure and offices of the society to corrupt the representatives and gain them to his purpose when he openly preengages the electors and prescribe to their choice such whom he have by solicitation threats promise or otherwise win to his design and employ them to bring in such who have promise beforehand what to vote and what to enact thus to regulate candidates and electors and new model the ways of election what be it but to cut up the government by the root and poison the very fountain of public security for the people have reserve to themselves the choice of their representatives as the fence to their properties could do it for no other end but that they might always be freely choose and so choose freely act and advise as the necessity of the commonwealth and the public good should upon examination and mature debate be judge to require this those who give their vote before they hear the debate and have weigh the reason on all side be not capable of do to prepare such an assembly as this and endeavour to set up the declare abettors of his own will for the true representatives of the people and the lawmakers of the society be certainly as great a breach of trust and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government as be possible to be meet with to which if one shall add reward and punishments visibly employ to the same end and all the arts of pervert law make use of to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country it will be past doubt what be do what power they ought to have in the society who thus employ it contrary to the trust that along with it in its first institution be easy to determine and one can not but see that he who have once attempt any such thing as this can not any longer be trust to this perhaps it will be say that the people be ignorant and always discontent to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people be to expose it to certain ruin and no government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up a new legislative whenever they take offence at the old one to this i answer quite the contrary people be not so easily get out of their old form as some be apt to suggest they be hardly to be prevail with to amend the acknowledge fault in the frame they have be accustom to and if there be any original defect or adventitious ones introduce by time or corruption it be not an easy thing to get them change even when all the world see there be an opportunity for it this slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitutions have in the many revolutions that have be see in this kingdom in this and former age still keep us to or after some interval of fruitless attempt still bring us back again to our old legislative of king lord and commons and whatever provocations have make the crown be take from some of our princes head they never carry the people so far as to place it in another line but it will be say this hypothesis lay a ferment for frequent rebellion to which i answer first no more than any other hypothesis for when the people be make miserable and find themselves expose to the ill usage of arbitrary power cry up their governors as much as you will for sons of jupiter let them be sacred and divine descend or authorise from heaven give them out for whom or what you please the same will happen the people generally ill treat and contrary to right will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sit heavy upon them they will wish and seek for the opportunity which in the change weakness and accidents of human affairs seldom delay long to offer itself he must have live but a little while in the world who have not see examples of this in his time and he must have read very little who can not produce examples of it in all sort of governments in the world secondly i answer such revolutions happen not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs great mistake in the rule part many wrong and inconvenient laws and all the slip of human frailty will be bear by the people without mutiny or murmur but if a long train of abuse prevarications and artifices all tend the same way make the design visible to the people and they can not but feel what they lie under and see whither they be go it be not to be wonder that they should then rouse themselves and endeavour to put the rule into such hand which may secure to them the end for which government be at first erect and without which ancient name and specious form be so far from be better that they be much worse than the state of nature or pure anarchy the inconveniencies be all as great and as near but the remedy farther off and more difficult thirdly i answer that this power in the people of provide for their safety anew by a new legislative when their legislators have act contrary to their trust by invade their property be the best fence against rebellion and the probable mean to hinder it for rebellion be an opposition not to persons but authority which be found only in the constitutions and laws of the government those whoever they be who by force break through and by force justify their violation of them be truly and properly rebel for when men by enter into society and civil government have exclude force and introduce laws for the preservation of property peace and unity amongst themselves those who set up force again in opposition to the laws do rebellarethat be bring back again the state of war and be properly rebel which they who be in power by the pretence they have to authority the temptation of force they have in their hand and the flattery of those about them be likeliest to do the proper way to prevent the evil be to show them the danger and injustice of it who be under the greatest temptation to run into it in both the forementioned case when either the legislative be change or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they be constitute those who be guilty be guilty of rebellion for if any one by force take away the establish legislative of any society and the laws by them make pursuant to their trust he thereby take away the umpirage which every one have consent to for a peaceable decision of all their controversies and a bar to the state of war amongst them they who remove or change the legislative take away this decisive power which nobody can have but by the appointment and consent of the people and so destroy the authority which the people do and nobody else can set up and introduce a power which the people hath not authorise actually introduce a state of war which be that of force without authority and thus by remove the legislative establish by the society in whose decisions the people acquiesce and unite as to that of their own will they untie the knot and expose the people anew to the state of war and if those who by force take away the legislative be rebel the legislators themselves as have be show can be no less esteem so when they who be set up for the protection and preservation of the people their liberties and properties shall by force invade and endeavour to take them away and so they put themselves into a state of war with those who make them the protectors and guardians of their peace be properly and with the greatest aggravation rebellantes rebel but if they who say it lay a foundation for rebellion mean that it may occasion civil war or intestine broil to tell the people they be absolve from obedience when illegal attempt be make upon their liberties or properties and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who be their magistrates when they invade their properties contrary to the trust put in them and that therefore this doctrine be not to be allow be so destructive to the peace of the world they may as well say upon the same grind that honest men may not oppose robbers or pirate because this may occasion disorder or bloodshed if any mischief come in such case it be not to be charge upon him who defend his own right but on him that invade his neighbour if the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he have for peace sake to him who will lay violent hand upon it i desire it may be consider what kind of a peace there will be in the world which consist only in violence and rapine and which be to be maintain only for the benefit of robbers and oppressors who would not think it an admirable peace betwixt the mighty and the mean when the lamb without resistance yield his throat to be tear by the imperious wolf polyphemuss den give us a perfect pattern of such a peace such a government wherein ulysses and his companion have nothing to do but quietly to suffer themselves to be devour and no doubt ulysses who be a prudent man preach up passive obedience and exhort them to a quiet submission by represent to them of what concernment peace be to mankind and by show what inconveniencies might happen if they should offer to resist polyphemus who have now the power over them the end of government be the good of mankind and which be best for mankind that the people should be always expose to the bind less will of tyranny or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be oppose when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power and employ it for the destruction and not the preservation of the properties of their people nor let any one say that mischief can arise from hence as often as it shall please a busy head or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the government it be true such men may stir whenever they please but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition for till the mischief be grow general and the ill design of the rulers become visible or their attempt sensible to the greater part the people who be more dispose to suffer than right themselves by resistance be not apt to stir the examples of particular injustice or oppression of here and there an unfortunate man move them not but if they universally have a persuasion ground upon manifest evidence that design be carry on against their liberties and the general course and tendency of things can not but give them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their governors who be to be blame for it who can help it if they who might avoid it bring themselves into this suspicion be the people to be blame if they have the sense of rational creatures and can think of things no otherwise than as they find and feel them and be it not rather their fault who put things in such a posture that they would not have them think as they be i grant that the pride ambition and turbulency of private men have sometimes cause great disorder in commonwealths and factions have be fatal to state and kingdoms but whether the mischief hath oftener begin in the people wantonness and a desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers or in the rulers insolence and endeavour to get and exercise an arbitrary power over their people whether oppression or disobedience give the first rise to the disorder i leave it to impartial history to determine this i be sure whoever either ruler or subject by force go about to invade the right of either prince or people and lay the foundation for overturn the constitution and frame of any just government he be guilty of the greatest crime i think a man be capable of be to answer for all those mischiefs of blood rapine and desolation which the break to piece of governments bring on a country and he who do it be justly to be esteem the common enemy and pest of mankind and be to be treat accordingly that subject or foreigners attempt by force on the properties of any people may be resist with force be agree on all hand but that magistrates do the same thing may be resist hath of late be deny as if those who have the greatest privilege and advantage by the law have thereby a power to break those laws by which alone they be set in a better place than their brethren whereas their offence be thereby the greater both as be ungrateful for the greater share they have by the law and break also that trust which be put into their hand by their brethren whosoever use force without rightas every one do in society who do it without lawputs himself into a state of war with those against whom he so use it and in that state all former tie be cancel all other right cease and every one have a right to defend himself and to resist the aggressor this be so evident that barclay himselfthat great assertor of the power and sacredness of kingsis force to confess that it be lawful for the people in some case to resist their king and that too in a chapter wherein he pretend to show that the divine law shut up the people from all manner of rebellion whereby it be evident even by his own doctrine that since they may in some case resist all resist of princes be not rebellion his word be these quod siquis dicat

debita reverentia propter acceptum injuriam praesentem denique impetum propulsandi non vim praeteritam ulciscendi jus habet horum enim alterum a natura est ut vitani scilicet corpusque tueamur alterum vero contra naturam ut inferior de superiori supplicium sumat quod itaque populus malum antequam factum sit impedire potest ne fiat id postquam factum est in regem authorem sceleris vindicare non potest populus igitur hoc amplius quam privatus quispiam habet quod huic vel ipsis adversariis judicibus excepto buchanano nullum nisi in patientia remedium superest cum ille si intolerabilis tyrannis est modicum enim ferre omnino debet resistere cum reverentia possit barclay contra monarchomachos iii in english thus but if any one should ask must the people then always lay themselves open to the cruelty and rage of tyrannymust they see their cities pillage and lay in ash their wive and children expose to the tyrants lust and fury and themselves and families reduce by their king to ruin and all the miseries of want and oppression and yet sit still must men alone be debar the common privilege of oppose force with force which nature allow so freely to all other creatures for their preservation from injury i answer selfdefence be a part of the law of nature nor can it be deny the community even against the king himself but to revenge themselves upon him must by no mean be allow them it be not agreeable to that law wherefore if the king shall show an hatred not only to some particular persons but set himself against the body of the commonwealth whereof he be the head and shall with intolerable illusage cruelly tyrannise over the whole or a considerable part of the people in this case the people have a right to resist and defend themselves from injury but it must be with this caution that they only defend themselves but do not attack their prince they may repair the damage receive but must not for any provocation exceed the bound of due reverence and respect they may repulse the present attempt but must not revenge past violences for it be natural for us to defend life and limb but that an inferior should punish a superior be against nature the mischief which be design them the people may prevent before it be do but when it be do they must not revenge it on the king though author of the villany this therefore be the privilege of the people in general above what any private person hath that particular men be allow by our adversaries themselves buchanan only except to have no other remedy but patience but the body of the people may with respect resist intolerable tyranny for when it be but moderate they ought to endure it thus far that great advocate of monarchical power allow of resistance it be true he have annex two limitations to it to no purpose first he say it must be with reverence secondly it must be without retribution or punishment and the reason he give be because an inferior can not punish a superior first how to resist force without strike again or how to strike with reverence will need some skill to make intelligible he that shall oppose an assault only with a shield to receive the blow or in any more respectful posture without a sword in his hand to abate the confidence and force of the assailant will quickly be at an end of his resistance and will find such a defence serve only to draw on himself the worse usage this be as ridiculous a way of resist as juvenal think it of fight ubi tu pulsas ego vapulo tantum and the success of the combat will be unavoidably the same he there describe it libertas pauperis haec est pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti this will always be the event of such an imaginary resistance where men may not strike again he therefore who may resist must be allow to strike and then let our author or anybody else join a knock on the head or a cut on the face with as much reverence and respect as he think fit he that can reconcile blow and reverence may for aught i know deserve for his pain a civil respectful cudgel wherever he can meet with it secondly as to his secondan inferior can not punish a superiorthat be true generally speak whilst he be his superior but to resist force with force be the state of war that level the party cancel all former relation of reverence respect and superiority and then the odds that remain isthat he who oppose the unjust aggressor have this superiority over him that he have a right when he prevail to punish the offender both for the breach of the peace and all the evils that follow upon it barclay therefore in another place more coherently to himself deny it to be lawful to resist a king in any case but he there assign two case whereby a king may unking himself his word be quid ergo nulline casus incidere possunt quibus populo sese erigere atque in regem impotentius dominantem arma capere et invadere jure suo suaque authoritate liceat nulli certe quamdiu rex manet semper enim ex divinis id obstat regem honorificato et qui potestati resistit dei ordinationi resistit non alias igitur in eum populo potestas est quam si id committat propter quod ipso jure rex esse desinat tunc enim se ipse principatu exuit atque in privatis constituit liber hoc modo populus et superior efficitur reverso ad eum scilicet jure illo quod ante regem inauguratum in interregno habuit at sunt paucorum generum commissa ejusmodi quae hunc effectum pariunt at ego cum plurima animo perlustrem duo tantum invenio duos inquam casus quibus rex ipso facto ex rege non regem se facit et omni honore et dignitate regali atque in subditos potestate destituit quorum etiam meminit winzerus horum unus est si regnum disperdat quemadmodum de nerone fertur quod be nempe senatum populumque romanum atque adeo urbem ipsam ferro flammaque vastare ac novas sibi sedes quaerere decrevisset et de caligula quod palam denunciarit se neque civem neque principem senatui amplius fore inque animo habuerit interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo quoque alexandriam commigrare ac ut populum uno ictu interimeret unam ei cervicem optavit talia cum rex aliquis meditatur et molitur serio omnem regnandi curam et animum ilico abjicit ac proinde imperium in subditos amittit ut dominus servi pro derelicto habiti dominium arlter casus est si rex in alicujus clientelam se contulit ac regnum quod liberum a majoribus et populo traditum accepit alienae ditioni mancipavit nam tunc quamvis forte non ea mente id agit populo plane ut incommodet tamen quia quod praecipuum est regiae dignitatis amisit ut summus scilicet in regno secundum deum sit et solo deo inferior atque populum etiam totum ignorantem vel invitum cujus libertatem sartam et tectam conservare debuit in alterius gentis ditionem et potestatem dedidit hac velut quadam rengi abalienatione effecit ut nec quod ipse in regno imperium habuit retineat nec in eum cui collatum voluit juris quicquam transferat atque ita eo facto liberum jam et suae potestatis populum relinquit cujus rei exemplum unum annales scotici suppeditantbarclay contra monarchomachos i iii c which may be thus englished what then can there no case happen wherein the people may of right and by their own authority help themselves take arm and set upon their king imperiously domineer over them none at all whilst he remain a king honour the king and he that resist the power resist the ordinance of god be divine oracles that will never permit it the people therefore can never come by a power over him unless he do something that make him cease to be a king for then he divest himself of his crown and dignity and return to the state of a private man and the people become free and superior the power which they have in the interregnum before they crown him king devolve to them again but there be but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this state after consider it well on all side i can find but two two case there be i say whereby a king ipso facto become no king and lose all power and regal authority over his people which be also take notice of by winzerus the first be if he endeavour to overturn the governmentthat be if he have a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth as it be record of nero that he resolve to cut off the senate and people of rome lay the city waste with fire and sword and then remove to some other place and of caligula that he openly declare that he would be no longer a head to the people or senate and that he have it in his thoughts to cut off the worthiest men of both rank and then retire to alexandria and he wish that the people have but one neck that he might dispatch them all at a blow such design as these when any king harbour in his thoughts and seriously promote he immediately give up all care and think of the commonwealth and consequently forfeit the power of govern his subject as a master do the dominion over his slave whom he hath abandon the other case be when a king make himself the dependent of another and subject his kingdom which his ancestors leave him and the people put free into his hand to the dominion of another for however perhaps it may not be his intention to prejudice the people yet because he have hereby lose the principal part of regal dignityviz to be next and immediately under god supreme in his kingdom and also because he betray or force his people whose liberty he ought to have carefully preserve into the power and dominion of a foreign nation by this as it be alienation of his kingdom he himself lose the power he have in it before without transfer any the least right to those on whom he would have bestow it and so by this act set the people free and leave them at their own disposal one example of this be to be find in the scotch annals in these case barclay the great champion of absolute monarchy be force to allow that a king may be resist and cease to be a king that be in shortnot to multiply casesin whatsoever he have no authority there he be no king and may be resist for wheresoever the authority cease the king cease too and become like other men who have no authority and these two case that he instance differ little from those above mention to be destructive to governments only that he have omit the principle from which his doctrine flow and that be the breach of trust in not preserve the form of government agree on and in not intend the end of government itself which be the public good and preservation of property when a king have dethrone himself and put himself in a state of war with his people what shall hinder them from prosecute him who be no king as they would any other man who have put himself into a state of war with them barclay and those of his opinion would do well to tell us bilson a bishop of our church and a great stickler for the power and prerogative of princes do if i mistake not in his treatise of christian subjection acknowledge that princes may forfeit their power and their title to the obedience of their subject and if there need authority in a case where reason be so plain i could send my reader to bracton fortescue and the author of the mirror and others writers that can not be suspect to be ignorant of our government or enemies to it but i think hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those men who rely on him for their ecclesiastical polity be by a strange fate carry to deny those principles upon which he build it whether they be herein make the tool of cunninger workmen to pull down their own fabric they be best look this i be sure their civil policy be so new so dangerous and so destructive to both rulers and people that as former age never could bear the broach of it so it may be hop those to come redeem from the impositions of these egyptian undertaskmasters will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers who whilst it seem to serve their turn resolve all government into absolute tyranny and would have all men bear to what their mean souls fit themslavery here it be like the common question will be make who shall be judge whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust this perhaps illaffected and factious men may spread amongst the people when the prince only make use of his due prerogative to this i reply the people shall be judge for who shall be judge whether his trustee or deputy act well and accord to the trust repose in him but he who depute him and must by have depute him have still a power to discard him when he fail in his trust if this be reasonable in particular case of private men why should it be otherwise in that of the greatest moment where the welfare of millions be concern and also where the evil if not prevent be greater and the redress very difficult dear and dangerous but farther this question who shall be judge can not mean that there be no judge at all for where there be no judicature on earth to decide controversies amongst men god in heaven be judge he alone it be true be judge of the right but every man be judge for himself as in all other case so in this whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him and whether he should appeal to the supreme judge as jephtha do if a controversy arise betwixt a prince and some of the people in a matter where the law be silent or doubtful and the thing be of great consequence i should think the proper umpire in such a case should be the body of the people for in such case where the prince hath a trust repose in him and be dispense from the common ordinary rule of the law there if any men find themselves aggrieve and think the prince act contrary to or beyond that trust who so proper to judge as the body of the people who at first lodge that trust in him how far they mean it should extend but if the prince or whoever they be in the administration decline that way of determination the appeal then lie nowhere but to heaven force between either persons who have no know superior on earth or which permit no appeal to a judge on earth be properly a state of war wherein the appeal lie only to heaven and in that state the injure party must judge for himself when he will think fit to make use of that appeal and put himself upon it to conclude the power that every individual give the society when he enter into it can never revert to the individuals again as long as the society last but will always remain in the community because without this there can be no communityno commonwealth which be contrary to the original agreement so also when the society hath place the legislative in any assembly of men to continue in them and their successors with direction and authority for provide such successors the legislative can never revert to the people whilst that government last because have provide a legislative with power to continue for ever they have give up their political power to the legislative and can not resume it but if they have set limit to the duration of their legislative and make this supreme power in any person or assembly only temporary or else when by the miscarriages of those in authority it be forfeit upon the forfeiture of their rulers or at the determination of the time set it revert to the society and the people have a right to act as supreme and continue the legislative in themselves or place it in a new form or new hand as they think good the end note it be no improbable opinion therefore which the archphilosopher be of that the chief person in every household be always as it be a king so when number of households join themselves in civil societies together kings be the first kind of governors among them which be also as it seemeth the reason why the name of father continue still in them who of father be make rulers as also the ancient custom of governors to do as melchizedec and be kings to exercise the office of priests which father do at the first grow perhaps by the same occasion howbeit this be not the only kind of regimen that have be receive in the world the inconveniencies of one kind have cause sundry others to be devise so that in a word all public regimen of what kind soever seemeth evidently to have rise from the deliberate advice consultation and composition between men judge it convenient and behoveful there be no impossibility in nature consider by itself but that man might have live without any public regimen hooker eccl pol i the public power of all society be above every soul contain in the same society and the principal use of that power be to give laws unto all that be under it which laws in such case we must obey unless there be reason show which may necessarily enforce that the law of reason or of god doth enjoin the contrary hooker eccl pol i to take away all such mutual grievances injuries and wrong ie such as attend men in the state of nature there be no way but only by grow into composition and agreement amongst themselves by ordain some kind of government public and by yield themselves subject thereunto that unto whom they grant authority to rule and govern by them the peace tranquillity and happy estate of the rest might be procure men always know that where force and injury be offer they might be defenders of themselves they know that however men may seek their own commodity yet if this be do with injury unto others it be not to be suffer but by all men and all good mean to be withstand finally they know that no man might in reason take upon him to determine his own right and accord to his own determination proceed in maintenance thereof in as much as every man be towards himself and them whom he greatly affect partial and therefore that strifes and trouble would be end less except they give their common consent all to be order by some whom they should agree upon without which consent there would be no reason that one man should take upon him to be lord or judge over another hooker ibid at the first when some certain kind of regimen be once appoint it may be that nothing be then further think upon for the manner of govern but all permit unto their wisdom and discretion which be to rule till by experience they find this for all part very inconvenient so as the thing which they have devise for a remedy do indeed but increase the sore which it should have cure they saw that to live by one man will become the cause of all mens misery this constrain them to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalties of transgress them hooker eccl pol i civil law be the act of the whole body politic doth therefore overrule each several part of the same body hooker ibid at the first when some certain kind of regimen be once approve it may be that nothing be then further think upon for the manner of govern but all permit unto

it should have cure they saw that to live by one man will become the cause of all mens misery this constrain them to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalties of transgress them hooker eccl pol the lawful power of make laws to command whole politic societies of men belong so properly unto the same entire societies that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of himself and not by express commission immediately and personally receive from god or else by authority derive at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws it be no better than mere tyranny laws they be not therefore which public approbation hath not make so hooker ibid of this point therefore we be to note that such men naturally have no full and perfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men therefore utterly without our consent we could in such sort be at no man commandment live and to be command we do consent when that society whereof we be a part hath at any time before consent without revoke the same after by the like universal agreement laws therefore human of what kind soever be available by consent hooker ibid two foundations there be which bear up public societies the one a natural inclination whereby all men desire sociable life and fellowship the other an order expressly or secretly
