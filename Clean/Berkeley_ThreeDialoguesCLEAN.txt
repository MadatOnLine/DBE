three dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to sceptics and atheists george berkeley content the first dialogue the second dialogue the third dialogue the first dialogue philonous good morning hylas i didnt expect to find you out and about so early hylas it be indeed somewhat unusual but my thoughts be so take up with a subject i be talk about last night that i couldnt sleep so i decide to get up and walk in the garden thats good it give you a chance to see what innocent and agreeable pleasures you lose every morning can there be a pleasanter time of the day or a more delightful season of the year that purple sky those wild but sweet note of bird the fragrant bloom on the tree and flower the gentle influence of the rise sun these and a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret raptures but im afraid i be interrupt your thoughts for you seem very intent on something yes i be and id be grateful if you would allow me to carry on with it but i dont in the least want to deprive myself of your company for my thoughts always flow more easily in conversation with a friend than when i be alone please may i share with you the thoughts i have be have with all my heart it be what i would have request myself if you hadnt ask first i be consider the odd fate of those men who have in all age through a desire to mark themselves off from the common people or through heaven know what trick of their think claim either to believe nothing at all or to believe the most extravagant things in the world this wouldnt matter so much if their paradoxes and scepticism didnt bring consequences that be bad for mankind in general but theres a risk that they will do that and that when men who be think to have spend their whole time in the pursuit of knowledge claim to be entirely ignorant of everything or advocate view that be in conflict with plain and commonly accept principles this will tempt other peoplewho have less leisure for this sort of thingto become suspicious of the most important truths ones they have previously think to be sacred and unquestionable i entirely agree with you about the bad effect of the parade doubt of some philosophers and the fantastical view of others i have felt this so strongly in recent time that i have drop some of the highflown theories i have learn in their universities replace them with ordinary common opinions since this revolt of mine against metaphysical notions and in favour of the plain dictate of nature and common sense i swear that i find i can think ever so much better so that i can now easily understand many things which previously be mysteries and riddle i be glad to find there be nothing in the account i hear of you what if you please be they in last nights conversation you be represent as someone who maintain the most extravagant opinion that ever enter into the mind of man namely that there be no such thing as material substance in the world i seriously believe that there be no such thing as what philosophers call material substance but if i be make to see anything absurd or sceptical in this then i would have the same reason to renounce this belief as i think i have now to reject the contrary opinion what can anything be more fantastical more in conflict with common sense or a more obvious piece of scepticism than to believe there be no such thing as matter steady on hylas what if it be to turn out that you who hold that there be matter areby virtue of that opiniona greater sceptic and maintain more paradoxes and conflict with common sense than i who believe no such thing you have as good a chance of convince me that the part be greater than the whole as of convince me that i must give up my belief in matter if i be to avoid absurdity and scepticism well then be you content to accept as true any opinion that turn out to be the most agreeable to common sense and most remote from scepticism with all my heart since you want to start arguments about the plainest things in the world i be content for once to hear what you have to say tell me please hylas what do you mean by a sceptic i mean what everyone mean someone who doubt everything so if someone have no doubt concern some particular point then with regard to that point he can not be think a sceptic i agree with you do doubt consist in accept the affirmative or the negative side of a question neither anyone who understand english must know that doubt signify a suspense between the two side so if someone deny any point he can no more be say to doubt concern it than he who affirm it with the same degree of assurance true and so his denial no more make him a sceptic than the other be i acknowledge it then how do it happen hylas that you call me a sceptic because i deny what you affirm namely the existence of matter for all you know i may be as firmly convince in my denial as you be in your affirmation hold on a moment philonous my definition of sceptic be wrong but you cant hold a man to every false step he make in conversation i do say that a sceptic be someone who doubt everything but i should have add or who deny the reality and truth of things what things do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences but these you know be universal intellectual notions and have nothing to do with matter so that the denial of matter doesnt imply the denial of them i agree about that but what about other things what do you think about distrust the sense deny the real existence of sensible things or claim to know nothing of them isnt that enough to qualify a man as a sceptic throughout the dialogues sensible mean capable of be sensedthat be visible or audible or tangible etc well then let us see which of us it be that deny the reality of sensible things or claim to have the greatest ignorance of them since if i understand you rightly he be to be count the greater sceptic that be what i desire what do you mean by sensible things things that be perceive by the sense can you imagine that i mean anything else im sorry but it may greatly shorten our enquiry if i have a clear grasp of your notions bear with me then while i ask you this further question be things perceive by the sense only the ones that be perceive immediately or do they include things that be perceive mediately that be through the intervention of something else i dont properly understand you in read a book what i immediately perceive be the letter on the page but mediately or by mean of these the notions of god virtue truth etc be suggest to my mind now theres no doubt that the letter be truly sensible things or things perceive by sense but i want to know whether you take the things suggest by them to be perceive by sense too no certainly it would be absurd to think that god or virtue be sensible things though they may be signify and suggest to the mind by sensible mark with which they have an arbitrary connection it seem then that by sensible things you mean only those that can be perceive immediately by sense right doesnt it follow from this that when i see one part of the sky red and another blue and i infer from this that there must be some cause for that difference of colour that cause can not be say to be a sensible thing or perceive by eyesight it do similarly when i hear a variety of sound i can not be say to hear their cause you can not and when by touch i feel a thing to be hot and heavy i cant say with any truth or correctness that i feel the cause of its heat or weight to head off any more question of this kind i tell you once and for all that by sensible things i mean only things that be perceive by sense and that the sense perceive only what they perceive immediately because they dont make inferences so the deduce of cause or occasion from effect and appearances which be the only things we perceive by sense be entirely the business of reason in this context occasion can be take as equivalent to cause the two term be separate in the second dialogue at page we agree then that sensible things include only things that be immediately perceive by sense now tell me whether we immediately perceive by sight anything besides light colour and shape by hear anything but sound by the palate anything besides taste by the sense of smell anything besides odours by touch anything more than tangible qualities we do not so it seem that if you take away all sensible qualities there be nothing leave that be sensible i agree sensible things then be nothing but so many sensible qualities or combinations of sensible qualities nothing else so heat be a sensible thing certainly do the reality of sensible things consist in be perceive or be it something different from their be perceivedsomething that doesnt involve the mind to exist be one thing and to be perceive be another i be talk only about sensible things my question be by the real existence of one of them do you mean an existence exterior to the mind and distinct from their be perceive i mean a real absolute existencedistinct from and have no relation to their be perceive so if heat be grant to have a real existence it must exist outside the mind it must tell me hylas be this real existence equally possible for all degrees of heat that we feel or be there a reason why we should attribute it to some degrees of heat and not to others if there be please tell me what it be whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense we can be sure exist also in the object that occasion it what the greatest as well as the least yes because the same reason hold for both they be both perceive by sense indeed the greater degree of heat be more intensely sensibly perceive so if there be any difference it be that we be more certain of the real existence of a greater heat than we can be of the reality of a lesser but isnt the most fierce and intense degree of heat a very great pain noone can deny that and can any unperceiving thing have pain or pleasure certainly not be your material substance a senseless thing or do it have sense and perception it be senseless without doubt so it cant be the subject of pain indeed it cant nor consequently can it be the subject of the greatest heat perceive by sense since you agree that this be a considerable pain i accept that then what be we to say about your external object be it a material substance or be it not it be a material substance with the sensible qualities inhere in it but then how can a great heat exist in it since you agree it can not exist in a material substance please clear up this point hold on philonous im afraid i go wrong in grant that intense heat be a pain i should have say not that the pain be the heat but that it be the consequence or effect of the heat when you put your hand near the fire do you feel one simple uniform sensation or two distinct sensations just one simple sensation isnt the heat immediately perceive it be and the pain true well then see that they be both immediately perceive at the same time and that the fire affect you with only one simple or uncompounded idea one idea without part it follow that this one simple idea be both the immediately perceive intense heat and the pain and consequently that the immediately perceive intense heat be identical with a particular sort of pain it seem so consult your thoughts again hylas can you conceive an intense sensation to occur without pain or pleasure i can not or can you form an idea of sensible pain or pleasure in general abstract from every particular idea of heat cold taste smell etc i dont find that i can then doesnt it follow that sensible pain be nothing but intense degrees of those sensations or ideas that be undeniable in fact im start to suspect that a very great heat cant exist except in a mind perceive it what be you then in that sceptical state of suspense between affirm and deny i think i can be definite about it a very violent and painful heat cant exist outside the mind so accord to you it have no real existence i admit it be it certain then that no body in nature be really hot i havent say that there be no real heat in body i only say that theres no such thing as an intense real heat in body but didnt you say earlier that all degrees of heat be equally real or that if there be any difference the greater heat be more certainly real than the lesser yes i do but that be because i have overlook the reason there be for distinguish between them which i now plainly see it be this because intense heat be nothing but a particular kind of painful sensation and pain cant exist except in a perceive be it follow that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal bodily substance but thats no reason for deny that less intense heat can exist in such a substance but how be we to draw the line separate degrees of heat that exist only in the mind from ones that exist outside it that isnt hard the slightest pain cant exist unperceived as you know so any degree of heat that be a pain exist only in the mind we dont have to think the same for degrees of heat that be not pain i think you agree a while back that no unperceiving be be capable of pleasure any more than it be of pain i do well isnt warmtha milder degree of heat than what cause discomfort or worsea pleasure what of it it follow that warmth cant exist outside the mind in any unperceiving substance or body so it seem so we have reach the position that degrees of heat that arent painful and also ones that be can exist only in a think substance cant we conclude from this that external body be absolutely incapable of any degree of heat whatsoever on second thoughts i be less sure that warmth be a pleasure than i be that intense heat be a pain i dont claim that warmth be as great a pleasure as heat be a pain but if you admit it to be even a small pleasure that be enough to yield my conclusion i could rather call it absence of pain it seem to be merely the lack of pain and of pleasure i hope you wont deny that this quality or state be one that an unthinking substance can have if you be determine to maintain that warmth be not a pleasure i dont know how to convince you otherwise except by appeal to your own experience but what do you think about cold the same as i do about heat an intense degree of cold be a pain for to feel a very great cold be to experience a great discomfort so it cant exist outside the mind but a lesser degree of cold can exist outside the mind as well as a lesser degree of heat so when we feel a moderate degree of heat or cold from a body that be apply to our skin we must conclude that that body have a moderate degree of heat or cold in it we must can any doctrine be true if it necessarily lead to absurdity certainly not isnt it an absurdity to think that a single thing should be at the same time both cold and warm it be well now suppose that one of your hand be hot and the other cold and that they be both at once plunge into a bowl of water that have a temperature between the two wont the water seem cold to one hand and warm to the other it will then doesnt it follow by your principles that the water really be both cold and warm at the same timethus believe something that you agree to be an absurdity i admit that that seem right so the principles themselves be false since you have admit that no true principle lead to an absurdity but after all can anything be more absurd than to say that there be no heat in the fire to make the point still clearer answer me this in two case that be exactly alike oughtnt we to make the same judgment we ought when a pin prick your finger doesnt it tear and divide the fibres of your flesh it do and when hot coal burn your finger do it do any more it do not you hold that the pin itself doesnt contain either the sensation that it cause or anything like it so give what you have just agree tonamely that like case should be judge alikeyou ought to hold that the fire doesnt contain either the sensation that it cause or anything like it well since it must be so i be content to give up this point and admit that heat and cold be only sensations exist in our mind still there be plenty of other qualities through which to secure the reality of external things but what will you say hylas if it turn out that the same argument apply with regard to all other sensible qualities and that none of them can be suppose to exist outside the mind any more than heat and cold can prove that would be quite a feat but i see no chance of your do so let us examine the other sensible qualities in order what about taste do you think they exist outside the mind or not can anyone in his right mind doubt that sugar be sweet or that wormwood be bitter tell me hylas be a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation or be it not it be and isnt bitterness some kind of discomfort or pain i grant that if therefore sugar and wormwood be unthinking corporeal substances exist outside the mind how can sweetness and bitternessthat be pleasure and painbe in them hold on philonous now i see what have delude me all this time you ask whether heat and cold sweetness and bitterness be particular sort of pleasure and pain to which i answer simply that they be i should have answer by make a distinction those qualities as perceive by us be pleasures or pain but as exist in the external object they be not so we can not conclude without qualification that there be no heat in the fire or sweetness in the sugar but only that heat or sweetness as perceive by us be not in the fire or the sugar what do you say to this i say it be irrelevant we be talk only about sensible things which you define as things we immediately perceive by our sense whatever other qualities you be talk about have no place in our conversation and i dont know anything about them you may indeed claim to have discover certain qualities that you dont perceive and assert that they exist in fire and sugar but i cant for the life of me see how that serve your side in the argument we be have tell me then once more do you agree that heat and cold sweetness and bitterness mean the qualities that be perceive by the sense dont exist outside the mind i see it be no use hold out so i give up the cause with respect to those four qualities though i must say it sound odd to say that sugar isnt sweet it might sound better to you if you bear this in mind someone whose palate be diseased may experience as bitter stuff that at other time seem sweet to him and its perfectly obvious that different people perceive different taste in the same food since what one man delight in another loathe how could this be if the taste be really inherent in the food i admit that i dont know how now think about odours dont they exactly fit what i have just be say about taste arent they just so many please or displease sensations they be then can you conceive it to be possible that they should exist in an unperceiving thing i can not or can you imagine that filth and excrement affect animals that choose to fee on them with the same smell that we perceive in them by no mean then cant we conclude that smell like the other qualities we have be discuss can not exist anywhere but in a perceive substance or mind i think so what about sound be they qualities really inherent in external body or not they dont inhere in the sound body we know this because when a bell be strike in a vacuum it send out no sound so the subject of sound must be the air explain that hylas when the air be set into motion we perceive a louder or softer sound in proportion to the air motion but when the air be still we hear no sound at all grant that we never hear a sound except when some motion be produce in the air i still dont see how you can infer from this that the sound itself be in the air this motion in the external air be what produce in the mind the sensation of sound by strike on the eardrum it cause a vibration which be pass along the auditory nerve to the brain whereon the mind experience the sensation call sound what be sound a sensation as i say as perceive by us it be a particular sensation in the mind and can any sensation exist outside the mind no certainly but if sound be a sensation how can it exist in the air if by the air you mean a senseless substance exist outside the mind philonous you must distinguish sound as it be perceive by us from sound as it be in itself orin other wordsdistinguish the sound we immediately perceive from the sound that exist outside us the former be indeed a particular kind of sensation but the latter be merely a vibration in the air i think i have already flatten that distinction by the answer i give when you be apply it in a similar case before but ill let that pass be you sure then that sound be really nothing but motion i be whatever be true of real sound therefore can truthfully be say of motion it may so it make sense to speak of motion as something that be loud sweet pierce or lowpitched i see you be determine not to understand me isnt it obvious that those qualities belong only to sensible sound or sound in the ordinary everyday mean of the word but not to sound in the real and scientific sense which as i have just explain be nothing but a certain motion of the air it seem then there be two sort of soundthe common everyday sort that we hear and the scientific and real sort that we dont hear just so and the latter kind of sound consist in motion as i tell you tell me hylas which of the sense do you think the idea of motion belong to the sense of hear certainly not to the sense of sight and touch it should follow then accord to you that real sound may possibly be see or felt but can never be hear look philonous make fun of my view if you want to but that wont alter the truth of things i admit that the inferences you draw from them sound a little odd but ordinary language be form by ordinary people for their own use so its not surprise if statements that express exact scientific notions seem clumsy and strange be it come to that i assure you i think i have score a pretty big win when you so casually depart from ordinary phrase and opinions because what we be mainly argue about be whose notions be furthest from the common road and most in conflict with what people in general think your claim that real sound be never hear and that we get our idea of sound through some other sensecan you think that this be merely an oddsounding scientific truth isnt something in it contrary to nature and the truth of things frankly i dont like it either give the concessions i have already make i have better admit that sound also have no real existence outside the mind and i hope you wont stick at admit the same of colour pardon me the case of colour be very different can anything be more obvious than the fact that we see colour on the object the object you speak of be i suppose corporeal substances exist outside the mind they be and they have true and real colour inhere in them each visible object have the colour that we see in it hah be there anything visible other than what we perceive by sight there be not and do we perceive anything by our sense that we dont perceive immediately how often do i have to say it i tell you we do not bear with me hylas and tell me yet again whether anything be immediately perceive by the sense other than sensible qualities i know you assert that nothing be but i want to know now whether you still think so i do now be your corporeal substance either a sensible quality or make up of sensible qualities what a question to ask who ever think it be here be why i ask when you say that each visible object have the colour that we see in it you imply that either visible object be sensible qualities or else something other than sensible qualities can be perceive by sight but we earlier agree that be false and you still think it be so we be leave with the thesis that visible object be sensible qualities now in this conversation you have be take it that visible object be corporeal substances and so we reach the conclusion that your corporeal substances be nothing but sensible qualities you may draw as many absurd consequences as you please and try to entangle the plainest things but you will never persuade me out of my sense i clearly understand my own mean i wish you would make me understand it too but since you dont want me to look into your notion of corporeal substance i shall drop that point but please tell me whether the colour that we see be the very ones that exist in external body or some other colour they be the very same ones oh then be the beautiful red and purple that we see on those cloud over there really in them or do you rather think that the cloud in themselves be nothing but a dark mist or vapour i must admit philonous that those colour arent really in the cloud as they seem to be at this distance they be only apparent colour apparent call you them how be we to distinguish these apparent colour from real ones very easily when a colour appear only at a distance and vanish when one come closer it be merely apparent and i suppose that real colour be ones that be reveal by look carefully from close up right do the closest and most careful way of look use a microscope or only the naked eye a microscope of course but a microscope often reveal colour in an object different from those perceive by unassisted sight and if we have microscopes that could magnify to as much as we like it be certain that no object whatsoever when see through them would appear with the same colour that it present to the naked eye well what do you conclude from that you cant argue that there be really and naturally no colour on object just because we can contrive artificial ways to alter them or make them vanish it can obviously be infer from your own concessions i think that all the colour we see with our naked eye be only apparentlike those on the cloudssince they vanish when one look more closely and accurately as one can with a microscope and to anticipate your next objection i ask you whether the real and natural state of an object be reveal better by a very sharp and pierce sight or by one that be less sharp by the former without doubt isnt it plain from the science of optics that microscopes make the sight more penetrate and represent object as they would appear to the eye if it be naturally endow with extreme sharpness it be so the microscopic representation of a thing should be regard as the one that best display the things real nature or what the thing be in itself so the colour perceive through a microscope be more genuine and real than those perceive in any other way i admit that theres something in what you say besides its not only possible but clearly true that there actually be animals whose eye be naturally form to perceive things that be too small for us to see what do you think about those inconceivably small animals that we perceive through microscopes must we suppose they be all totally blind if they can see dont we have to suppose that their sight have the same use in preserve their body from injuries as eyesight do in all other animals if it do have that use isnt it obvious that they must see particles that be smaller than their own body which will present them with a vastly different view of each object from the view that strike our sense even our own eye dont always represent object to us in the same way everyone know that to someone suffer from jaundice all things seem yellow so isnt it highly probable that animals whose eye we see to be differently structure from ours and whose bodily fluids be unlike ours dont see the same colour as we do in every object from all of this shouldnt it seem to follow that all colour be equally apparent and that none of the ones that we see be really in any outer object it should to put it past all doubt consider the follow if colour be real properties or qualities inhere in external body they couldnt be alter except by some alteration in the very body themselves but isnt it evident that the colour of an object can be change or make to disappear entirely through the use of a microscope or some change in the fluids in the eye or a change in the view distance without any sort of real alteration in the thing itself indeed even when all the other factor remain unaltered some object present different colour to the eye depend on the angle from which they be look at the same thing happen when we view an object in different brightnesses of light and everyone know that the same body appear differently colour by candlelight from what they do in daylight add to these facts our experience of a prism which separate the different ray of light and thereby alter the colour of an object cause the whitest object to appear deep blue or red to the naked eye now tell me whether you still think that each body have its true real colour inhere in it if you think it have i want to know what particular distance and orientation of the object what special condition of the eye what intensity or kind of light be need for discover that true colour and distinguish it from the apparent ones i admit to be quite convince that they be all equally apparent that no such thing as colour really inhere in external body and that colour be wholly in the light what confirm me in this opinion be the fact that colour be more or less vivid depend on the brightness of the light and that when there be no light no colour be see furthermore if there be colour in external object how could we possibly perceive them no external body affect the mind unless it act first on our senseorgans and the only action of body be motion and this cant be communicate except in collisions so a distant object cant act on the eye and so cant enable itself or its properties to be perceive by the mind from this it plainly follow that what immediately cause the perception of colour be some substance that be in contact with the eyesuch as light what be light a substance i tell you philonous external light be simply a thin fluid substance whose tiny particles when agitate with a brisk motion and in various ways reflect to the eye from the different surface of outer object cause different motion in the optic nerve these motion be pass along to the brain where they cause various state and events and these be accompany by the sensations of red blue yellow etc it seem then that all the light do be to shake the optic nerve that be all and as a result of each particular motion of the nerve the mind be affect with a sensation which be some particular colour right and these sensations have no existence outside the mind they have not then how can you say that colour be in the light since you take light to be a corporeal substance external to the mind light and colour as immediately perceive by us can not exist outside the mind i admit that but in themselves they be only the motion and arrangements of certain insensible particles of matter colour then in the ordinary sensethat be understand to be the immediate object of sightcannot be have by any substance that doesnt perceive that be what i say well then you give up your position as regard those sensible qualities which be what all mankind take to be colour think what you like about the scientists invisible colour it be not my business to argue about them but i suggest that you consider whether it be wise for you in a discussion like this one to affirm that the red and blue we see be not real colour and that certain unknown motion and shape which no man ever do or could see be real colour arent these shock notions and arent they open to as many ridiculous inferences as those you have to give up in the case of sound i have to admit philonous that i cant keep this up any longer colour sound tastesin a word all that be term secondary qualitieshave no existence outside the mind but in grant this i dont take anything away from the reality of matter or external object because various philosophers maintain what i just do about secondary qualities and yet be the far from deny matter in this context philosophers mean philosophers and scientists to make this clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities into primary and secondary primary qualities be extendedness shape solidity gravity motion and rest they hold that these really exist in body secondary qualities be all the sensible qualities that arent primary and the philosophers assert that these be merely sensations or ideas exist nowhere but in the mind no doubt you be already aware of all this for my part i have long know that such an opinion be current among philosophers but i be never thoroughly convince of its truth till now so you still believe that extension and shape be inherent in external unthinking substances here extension could mean extendedness or it could mean size i do but what if the arguments that be bring against secondary qualities hold against these also why then i shall have to think that shape and extension also exist only in the mind be it your opinion that the very shape and extension that you perceive by sense exist in the outer object or material substance it be have all other animals as good reason as you do to think that the shape and extension that they see and feel be in the outer object surely they do if they can think at all tell me hylas do you think that the sense be give to all animals for their preservation and wellbeing in life or be they give only to men for that end i dont doubt that they have the same use in all other animals if so mustnt their sense enable them to perceive their own limbs and to perceive body that be capable of harm them certainly a tiny insect therefore must be suppose to see its own foot and other things of that size or even smaller see them all as body of considerable size even though you can see themif at allonly as so many visible point i cant deny that and to creatures even smaller than that insect they will seem even bigger they will so that something you can hardly pick out because it be so small will appear like a huge mountain to an extremely tiny animal i agree about all this can a single thing have different size at the same time it would be absurd to think so but from what you have say it follow that the true size of the insects foot be the size you see it have and the size the insect see it as have and all the size it be see as have by animals that be even smaller that be to say your own principles have lead you into an absurdity i seem to be in some difficulty about this another point didnt you agree that no real inherent property of any object can be change unless the thing itself alter i do but as we move towards or away from an object its visible size vary be at one distance ten or a hundred time greater than at another doesnt it follow from this too that size isnt really inherent in the object i admit that i dont know what to think you will soon be able to make up your mind if you will venture to think as freely about this quality as you have about the others didnt you admit that it be legitimate to infer that neither heat nor cold be in the water from the premise that the water seem warm to one hand and cold to the other i do isnt it the very same reason to infer that there be no size or shape in an object from the premise that to one eye it seem little smooth and round while to the other eye it appear big uneven and angular the very same but do the latter ever happen you can at any time find out that it do by look with one eye bare and with the other through a microscope i dont know how to maintain it yet i be reluctant to give up extension size because i see so many odd consequences follow from the concession that extension isnt in the outer object odd you say after the things you have already agree to i hope you wont be put off from anything just because it be odd but in any case wouldnt it seem very odd if the general reason that cover all the other sensible qualities didnt apply also to extension if you agree that no idea or anything like an idea can exist in an unperceiving substance then surely it follow that no shape or mode of extension or specific way of be extend that we can have any idea ofin perceive or imaginingcan be really inherent in matter whether the sensible quality be shape or sound or colour or what you will it seem impossible that any of these should subsist in something that doesnt perceive it not to mention the peculiar difficulty there must be in conceive a material substance prior to and distinct from extension to be the substratum of extension ill say more about that shortly i give up on this point for just now but i reserve the right to retract my opinion if i later discover that i be lead to it by a false step that be a right you cant be deny shape and extendedness be dispose of we proceed next to motion can a real motion in any external body be at the same time both very swift and very slow it can not isnt the speed at which a body move inversely proportional to the time it take to go any give distance thus a body that travel a mile in an hour move three time as fast as it would if it travel only a mile in three hours i agree with you and isnt time measure by the succession of ideas in our mind it be and isnt it possible that ideas should succeed one another twice as fast in your mind as they do in mine or in the mind of some kind of nonhuman spirit i agree about that consequently the same body may seem to another spirit to make its journey in half the time that it seem to you to take half be just an example any other fraction would make the point just as well that be to say accord to your view that both of the perceive motion be in the object a single body can really move both very swiftly and very slowly at the same time how be this consistent either with common sense or with what you recently agree to i have nothing to say to it now for solidity if you dont use solidity to name any sensible quality then it be irrelevant to our enquiry if you do use it to name a sensible quality the quality must be either hardness or resistance but each of these be plainly relative to our sense it be obvious that what seem hard to one animal may appear soft to another that have greater force and firmness of limbs and it be equally obvious that the resistance i feel when i press against a body be not in the body i agree that the sensation of resistance which be all you immediately perceive be not in the body but the cause of that sensation be but the cause of our sensations arent immediately perceive and therefore arent sensible i think we have settle this point i admit that we do excuse me if i seem a little embarrass i be have trouble quit my earlier view it may be a help for you to consider this point once extendedness be admit to have no existence outside the mind the same must be grant for motion solidity and gravity since obviously they all presuppose extendedness so it be superfluous to enquire into each of them separately in deny extendedness you have deny them all to have any real existence if this be right philonous i wonder why the philosophers who deny the secondary qualities any real existence should yet attribute it to the primary qualities if theres no difference between them how can this be account for it isnt my business to account for every opinion of the philosophers but there be many possible explanations one of them be that those philosophers be influence by the fact that pleasure and pain be associate with the secondary qualities rather than with the primary ones heat and cold taste and smell have something more vividly please or disagreeable than what we get from the ideas of extendedness shape and motion and since it be too visibly absurd to hold that pain or pleasure can be in an unperceiving substance men have more easily be wean from believe in the external existence of the secondary qualities than of the primary ones you will see that there be something in this if you recall the distinction you make between moderate heat and intense heat allow one a real existence outside the mind while deny it to the other but after all there be no rational basis for that distinction for surely a sensation that be neither please nor painful be just as much a sensation as one that be please or painful so neither kind should be suppose to exist in an unthinking subject it have just come into my head philonous that i have somewhere hear of a distinction between absolute and sensible extendedness grant that large and small consist merely in the relation other extend things have to the part of our own body and so arent really in the substances themselves still we dont have to say the same about absolute extendedness which be something abstract from large and small from this or that particular size and shape similarly with motion fast and slow be altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own mind but just because those special case of motion do not exist outside the mind it doesnt follow that the same be true of the absolute motion that be abstract from them what distinguish one instance of motion or of extendedness from another isnt it something sensiblefor instance some speed or some size and shape i think so so these qualitiesnamely absolute motion and absolute extendednesswhich be strip of all sensible properties have no feature make them more specific in any way that be right that be to say they be extendedness in general and motion in general if you say so but everyone accept the maxim that every thing that exist be particular how then can motion in general or extendedness in general exist in any corporeal substance i will need time to think about that i think the point can be speedily decide without doubt you can tell whether you be able to form this or that idea in your mind now im will to let our present dispute be settle in the follow way if you can form in your thoughts a distinct abstract idea of motion or extendedness have none of those sensible qualitiesswift and slow large and small round and square and the likewhich we agree exist only in the mind then ill capitulate but if you cant it will be unreasonable for you to insist any longer on something of which you have no notion to be frank i can not can you even separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from the ideas of all the socalled secondary qualities what isnt it easy to consider extendedness and motion by themselves abstract from all other sensible qualities isnt that how the mathematicians handle them i acknowledge hylas that it be not difficult to form general proposition and reason about extendedness and motion without mention any other qualities and in that sense to treat them abstractedly i can pronounce the word motion by itself but how do it follow from this that i can form in my mind the idea of motion without an idea of body theorems about extension and shape can be prove without any mention of large or small or any other sensible quality but how do it follow from this that the mind can form and grasp an abstract idea of extension without any particular size or shape or other sensible quality mathematicians study quantity disregard any other sensible qualities that go with it on the ground that they be irrelevant to the proof but when they lay aside the word and contemplate the bare ideas i think youll find that they arent the pure abstract ideas of extendedness but what do you say about pure intellect cant abstract ideas be form by that faculty since i cant form abstract ideas at all it be clearly impossible for me to form them with help from pure intellect whatever faculty you mean that phrase to refer to set aside question about the nature of pure intellect and its spiritual object such as virtue reason god etc i can say this much that seem clearly true sensible things can only be perceive by the sense or represent by the imagination so shape and size dont belong to pure intellect because they be initially perceive through the sense if you want to be surer about this try and see if you can frame the idea of any shape abstract from all particularities of size and from other sensible qualities let me think a littlei dont find that i can well can you think it possible that something might really exist in nature when it imply a contradiction in its conception by no mean therefore since even the mind cant possibly separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from all other sensible qualities doesnt it follow that where the former exist the latter must also exist it would seem so consequently the very same arguments that you agree to be decisive against the secondary qualities need no extra help to count just as strongly against the primary qualities also besides if you trust your sense dont they convince you that all sensible qualities coexist that be that they all appear to the sense as be in the same place do your sense ever represent a motion or shape as be divest of all other visible and tangible qualities you neednt say any more about this i freely admit unless there have be some hide error or oversight in our discussion up to herethat all sensible qualities should alike be deny existence outside the mind but i fear that i may have be too free in my former concessions or overlook some fallacy in your line of argument in short i didnt take time to think as to that hylas take all the time you want to go back over our discussion you be at liberty to repair any slip you have make or to support your initial opinion by present arguments that you have so far overlook i think it be a big oversight on my part that i fail to distinguish sufficiently the object from the sensation the sensation can not exist outside the mind but it doesnt follow that the object can not either what object do you mean the object of the sense exactly so it be immediately perceive right explain to me the difference between what be immediately perceive and a sensation i take the sensation to be an act of the perceive mind beside which there be something perceive which i call the object of the act for example there be red and yellow on that tulip but the act of perceive those colour be in me only and not in the tulip what tulip be you talk about be it the one that you see the same and what do you see beside colour shape and extendedness nothing so you would say that the red and yellow be coexistent with the extension wouldnt you yes and i go further i say that they have a real existence outside the mind in some unthinking substance that the colour be really in the tulip which i see be obvious nor can it be deny that this tulip may exist independently of your mind or mine but that any immediate object of the sensesthat be any idea or combination of ideasshould exist in an unthinking substance or exterior to all mind be in itself an obvious contradiction nor can i imagine how it follow from what you say just now namely that the red and yellow be in the tulip you saw since you dont claim to see that unthinking substance you be skillful at change the subject philonous i see that you dont want me to push on in that direction so let return to your distinction between sensation and object if i understand you correctly you hold that in every perception there be two things of which one be an action of the mind and the other be not true and this action cant exist in or belong to any unthinking thing but whatever else be involve in a perception may do so that be my position so that if there be a perception without any act of the mind that perception could exist in an unthinking substance i grant that but it be impossible that there should be such a perception when be the mind say to be active when it produce put an end to or change anything can the mind produce discontinue or change anything in any way except by an act of the will it can not so the mind be to count as be active in its perceptions to the extent that volition be include in them it be when i pluck this flower i be active because i do it by a handmovement which arise from my volition so likewise in hold it up to my nose but be either of these smell no i also act when i draw air through my nose because my breathe in that manner rather than otherwise be an effect of my volition but this isnt smell either for if it be i would smell every time i breathe in that manner true smell then be a result of all this pluck hold up and breathe in it be but i dont find that my will be involve any further that be in anything other than the pluck hold up and breathe in whatever else happensincluding my perceive a smellis independent of my will and i be wholly passive with respect to it be it different in your case hylas no its just the same now consider see isnt it in your power to open your eye or keep them shut to turn them this way or that without doubt but do it similarly depend on your will that when you look at this flower you perceive white rather than some other colour when you direct your open eye towards that part of the sky can you avoid see the sun or be light or darkness the effect of your volition no certainly in these respect then you be altogether passive i be tell me now do see consist in perceive light and colour or rather in open and turn the eye the former certainly well then since in the actual perception of light and colour you be altogether passive what have become of that action that you say be an ingredient in every sensation and doesnt it follow from your own concessions that the perception of light and colourswhich doesnt involve any actioncan exist in an unperceiving substance and isnt this a plain contradiction i dont know what to think furthermore since you distinguish active and passive elements in every perception you must do it in the perception of pain but how could painhowever inactive it ispossibly exist in an unperceiving substance think about it and then tell me frankly arent light and colour taste sound etc all equally passions or sensations in the mind you may call them external object and give them in word whatever kind of existence you like but examine your own thoughts and then tell me whether i be not right i admit philonous that when i look carefully at what go on in my mind all i can find be that i be a think be that have a variety of sensations and i cant conceive how a sensation could exist in an unperceiving substance but when on the other hand i look in a different way at sensible things consider them as so many properties and qualities i find that i have to suppose a material substratum without which they cant be conceive to exist material substratum you call it tell me please which of your sense acquaint you with it it be not itself sensible only its properties and qualities be perceive by the sense i presume then that you obtain the idea of it through reflection and reason i dont claim to have any proper positive idea of it here positive mean nonrelational hylas mean that he doesnt have an idea that represent what material substance be like in itself but i conclude that it exist because qualities cant be conceive to exist without a support so it seem that you have only a relative notion of material substance you conceive it only by conceive how it relate to sensible qualities right tell me please what that relation be isnt it sufficiently express in the term substratum or substance one be latin and mean underneath layer the other come from latin mean stand under if so the word substratum should mean that it be spread under the sensible qualities true and consequently spread under extendedness i agree so in its own nature it be entirely distinct from extendedness i tell you extendedness be only a quality and matter be something that support qualities and isnt it obvious that the support thing be different from the support one so something distinct from extendedness and not include it be suppose to be the substratum of extendedness just so tell me hylas can a thing be spread without be extend isnt the idea of extendedness necessarily include in that of spread it be so anything that you suppose to be spread under something else must have in itself an extendedness distinct from the extendedness of the thing under which it be spread it must consequently every bodily substance be the substratum of extendedness must have in itself another extendedness which qualify it to be a substratum and that extendedness must also have something spread under it a subsubstratum so to speak and so on to infinity isnt this absurd in itself as well as conflict with what you have just say namely that the substratum be something distinct from extendedness and not include it yes but philonous you misunderstand me i dont mean that matter be spread in a crude literal sense under extension the word substratum be use only to express in general the same thing as substance well then let us examine the relation imply in the term substance be it not the relation of stand under qualities the very same but doesnt a thing have to be extend if it be to stand under or support another yes so isnt this supposition infect with the same absurdity as the previous one you still take things in a strict literal sense that isnt fair philonous i dont want to force any mean onto your word you be free to explain them as you please but please make me understand something by them you tell me that matter support or stand under accidents how as your legs support your body no that be the literal sense please let me know any sense literal or not literal that you understand it inhow long must i wait for an answer hylas i dont know what to say i once think i understand well enough what be mean by matter support qualities but now the more i think about it the less i understand it in short i find that i dont know anything about it so it seem that you have no idea at all either positive or relative of matter you dont know what it be in itself or what relation it have to qualities i admit it and yet you say that you couldnt conceive the real existence of qualities without conceive at the same time a material support for them i do that amount to say that when you conceive the real existence of qualities you also conceive something that you cant conceive it be wrong i admit but still i fear there be some fallacy or other let me try this it have just occur to me that we be both lead into error by your treat each quality by itself i grant that no quality can exist on its own outside the mind colour cant exist without extension nor can shape exist without some other sensible quality but as a number of qualities unite or blend together constitute an entire sensible thing there be no obstacle to suppose that such thingsthat be such collections of qualitiescan exist outside the mind be you joke hylas or do you have a very bad memory we do indeed go through all the qualities by name one after another but my argumentsor rather your concessionsnowhere tend to prove that the secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind in isolation the point be rather that secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind at all its true that existinginisolation do come up in our discussion in discuss shape and motion we conclude they couldnt exist outside the mind because it be impossible even in think to separate them from all secondary qualities so as to conceive them exist by themselves but this wasnt the only argument i use on that occasion however if you like we can set aside our whole conversation up to here count it as nothing i be will to let our whole debate be settle as follow if you can conceive it to be possible for any mixture or combination of qualities or any sensible object whatever to exist outside the mind then i will grant it actually to be so by that test the point will soon be decide what be easier than to conceive a tree or house exist by itself independently of and unperceived by any mind whatsoever i conceive them exist in that way right now tell me hylas can you see a thing which be at the same time unseen no that would be a contradiction be it not as great a contradiction to talk of conceive a thing which be unconceived it be the tree or house therefore which you think of be conceive by you how could it be otherwise and what be conceive be surely in the mind without question what be conceive be in the mind then what lead you to say that you conceive a house or tree exist independently and out of all mind whatsoever that be an oversight i admit but give me a moment to think about what lead me into it it wasi now realize after reflectionan amuse mistake as i be think of a tree in a solitary place with nobody there to see it i think that be conceive a tree as exist unperceived or unthought of overlook the fact i myself conceive it all the while but now i plainly see that all i can do be to form ideas in my own mind i can conceive in my own thoughts the idea of a tree or a house or a mountain but that be all and this be far from prove that i can conceive them exist out of the mind of all spirit you agree then that you cant conceive how any corporeal sensible thing should exist otherwise than in a mind i do and yet you will earnestly contend for the truth of something that you cant even conceive i admit that i dont know what to think but i still have doubt isnt it certain that i see things at a distance dont we perceive the star and moon for example to be a long way away isnt this i say obvious to the sense dont you in dream also perceive object like those i do and dont they then appear in the same way to be distant they do but do you conclude that the apparitions in a dream be outside the mind by no mean then you ought not to conclude that sensible object see when you be awake be outside the mind from their appearance or the manner in which you perceive them i admit that but doesnt my visual sense deceive me in those case by tell me that sensible object be at a distance when really they be not by no mean neither eyesight nor reason inform you that the idea or thing that you immediately perceive actually exist outside the mind by eyesight you know only that you be affect with certain sensations of light and colour etc and you wont say that these be outside the mind true but all the same dont you think that eyesight make some suggestion of outerness or distance when you approach a distant object do the visible size and shape keep change or do they appear the same at all distance they be in a continual change so sight doesnt suggest or in any way inform you that the visible object you immediately perceive exist at a distance or that it will be perceive when you move further forward because there be a continue series of visible object succeed each other during the whole time of your approach i agree about that but still i know on see an object what object i shall see after i have go a certain distancenever mind whether it be exactly the same object or not so something about distance be still be suggest my dear hylas just think about that a little and then tell me whether there be anything more to it that this from the ideas that you actually perceive by sight you have by experience learn to infer in accordance with the general rule of nature what other ideas you will experience after such and such a succession of time and motion upon the whole i think thats what it come down to isnt it obvious that if a man bear blind be suddenly enable to see he would start with no experience of what may be suggest by sight it be so he would not accord to you have any notion of distance link to the things he saw he would take the latter to be a new set of sensations exist only in his mind that be undeniable but to make it still more plain isnt distance a line run out from the eye it be can a line so situate be perceive by sight it can not so doesnt it follow that distance isnt strictly and immediately perceive by sight it seem so again do you think that colour be at a distance i have to acknowledge that they be only in the mind but dont colour appear to the eye as coexist at the same place as extension and shape they do then how can you conclude from the deliverances of sight that shape do exist outside the mind when you agree that colour dont the sensible appearances of both be the very same i dont know what to answer even if distance be truly and immediately perceive by the mind it still wouldnt follow that it exist out of the mind for whatever be immediately perceive be an idea and can any idea exist out of the mind it would be absurd to suppose so but tell me philonous can we perceive or know nothing except our ideas set aside what we may know through the rational deduce of cause from effect that be irrelevant to our enquiry as for the sense you be the best judge of whether you perceive anything that you dont immediately perceive and i ask you be the things you immediately perceive anything but your own sensations or ideas in the course of this conversation you have more than once declare yourself on those two point this latest question of yours seem to indicate that you have change your mind to tell you the truth philonous i think there be two kinds of object one kind perceive immediately and call ideas the other kind be real things or external object perceive by the mediation of ideas which resemble and represent them now i grant that ideas dont exist outside the mind but the second sort of object do i be sorry i didnt think of this distinction sooner it would probably have cut short your discourse be those external object perceive by sense or by some other faculty they be perceive by sense what be there anything perceive by sense that isnt immediately perceive yes philonous there isin a way for example when i look at a picture or statue of julius caesar i may be say to perceive him in a fashion though not immediately by my sense you seem to hold then that our ideas which be all that we immediately perceive be picture of external things and that the latter be also perceive by sense because they have a conformity or resemblance to our ideas that be my mean and in the same way that julius caesar in himself invisible be nevertheless perceive by sight so also real things in themselves imperceptible be perceive by sense in the very same way tell me hylas when you look at the picture of julius caesar do you see with your eye anything more than some colour and shape with a certain symmetry and composition of the whole nothing else and wouldnt a man who have never know anything about julius caesar see as much he would so he have his sight and the use of it as perfectly as you have yours i agree with you then why be your thoughts direct to the roman emperor while his be not this cant come from the sensations or ideas of sense that you perceive at that moment for you have agree that you have in that respect no advantage over the man who have never hear of julius caesar so it seem that the direction of your thoughts come from reason and memorydoesnt it it do so that example of yours doesnt show that anything be perceive by sense that isnt immediately perceive i dont deny that we can be say in a certain sense to perceive sensible things mediately by sense that be when the immediate perception of ideas by one sense suggest to the mind others perhaps belong to another sense of a kind that have often be perceive to go with ideas of the former kind for instance when i hear a coach drive along the streets all that i immediately perceive be the sound but from my past experience that such a sound be connect with a coach i be say to hear the coach still it be obvious that in truth and strictness nothing can be hear but sound and the coach in that example be not strictly perceive by sense but only suggest from experience similarly when we be say to see a redhot bar of iron the solidity and heat of the iron be not the object of sight but be suggest to the imagination by the colour and shape that be strictly perceive by that sense in short the only things that be actually and strictly perceive by any sense be the ones that would have be perceive even if we have only just acquire that sense and be use it for the first time as for other things clearly they be only suggest to the mind by past experience but to return to your comparison of imperceptible real things with caesars picture obviously if you keep to this youll have to hold that the real things that our ideas copy be perceive not by sense but by some internal faculty of the soul such as reason or memory i would be interest to know what arguments reason give you for the existence of your real things or material object or whether you remember see them formerly not as copy by your ideas but as they be in themselves or if you have hear or read of anyone else who do i can see that you want to make fun of me philonous but that will never convince me all i want be to learn from you how to come by knowledge of material things whatever we perceive be perceive either immediately by sense or mediately by reason and reflection but you have exclude sense so please show me what reason you have to believe in their existence or what mean you can possibly adopt to prove to my understand or your own that they exist to be perfectly frank philonous now that i think about it i cant find any good reason for my position but it seem pretty clear that its at least possible that such things really exist and as long as there be no absurdity in suppose them i shall continue in my belief until you bring good reason to the contrary what have it come to this that you believe in the existence of material object and that this belief be base on the mere possibility of its be true then you challenge me to bring reason against it though some people would think that the burden of proof lie with him who hold the affirmative position anyway this very thesis that you be now determine to maintain without any reason be in effect one that you havemore than once during this conversationseen good reason to give up but let us set all that aside if i understand you rightly you say our ideas dont exist outside the mind but that they be copy liken or representations of certain originals that do you have me right our ideas then be like external things they be do those external things have a stable and permanent nature independently of our sense or do they keep change as we move our body and do things with our faculties or organs of sense real things obviously have a fix and real nature which remain the same through any change in our sense or in how our body be place or how they move such change may indeed affect the ideas in our mind but it would be absurd to think they have the same effect on things exist outside the mind how then can things that be perpetually fleet and variable as our ideas be be copy or liken of any thing that be fix and constant since all sensible qualitiessize shape colour etcthat be our ideas be continually change with every alteration in the distance medium or instrument of sensation how can any fix material object be properly represent or depict by several distinct things or ideas each of which be so unlike the others or if you say that the object resemble just one of our ideas how can we distinguish that true copy from all the false ones i have to admit philonous that i be at a loss i dont know what to say to this there be more be material object in themselves perceptible or imperceptible properly and immediately nothing can be perceive but ideas all material things therefore be in themselves insensible and can be perceive only through ideas of them ideas be sensible then and their originalsthe things they be copy ofare insensible right but how can something that be sensible be like something that be insensible can a real thing in itself invisible be like a colour can a real thing that isnt audible be like a sound in a word can anything be like a sensation or idea but another sensation or idea i must admit that i think not can there possibly be any doubt about this dont you perfectly know your own ideas yes i know them perfectly for something that i dont perceive or know cant be any part of my idea well then examine your ideas and then tell me if theres anything in them that could exist outside the mind or if you can conceive anything like them exist outside the mind upon look into it i find that i cant conceive or understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea and it be most evident that no idea can exist outside the mind so youre force by your own principles to deny the reality of sensible things because you make it consist in an absolute existence outside the mind that be to say you be a downright sceptic so i have meet my target which be to show that your principles lead to scepticism for the present i be if not entirely convince at least silence i wonder what more you would require in order to be perfectly convince havent you be free to explain yourself in any way you like be any little conversational slip hold against you werent you allow to retract or reinforce anything you have previously say as best serve your purpose hasnt everything you could say be hear and examine with all the fairness imaginable in a word havent you on every point be convince out of your own mouth and if you can now discover any flaw in any of your former concessions or think of any remain tactic any new distinction shade or comment whatsoever why dont you produce it a little patience philonous i be at present so bewilder to see myself entangle and as it be imprison in the labyrinths you have lead me into that i cant be expect to find my way out on the spur of the moment you must give me time to look around me and recollect myself listenisnt that the collegebell let us go in and meet here again tomorrow morning in the mean time you can think about this mornings conversation and see if you can find any fallacy in it or invent any new mean to extricate yourself agree the second dialogue hylas i beg your pardon philonous for not meet you sooner all this morning my head be so fill with our recent conversation that i didnt notice the time of the day or indeed anything else philonous i be glad you be so focus on it i hope that if there be any mistake in your concessions or fallacies in my reason from them you will now show them to me i assure you ever since i saw you i have do nothing but search for mistake and fallacies and with that in mind i have examine in detail the whole course of yesterdays conversation but it have all be useless for the view i be lead into in the conversation seem even clearer and more obvious when i review them today and the more i think about them the more irresistibly they force my assent to them dont you think that this be a sign that they be genuine and that they proceed from nature and be in accordance with right reason truth and beauty have this in common they both show to advantage when look at closely and carefully the false glitter of error and heavy makeup cant endure be look at for too long or from too close up i admit there be a great deal in what you say and i be as convince as anyone could be of the truth of those strange consequences that you argue for yesterday so long as i keep in mind the reason that lead to them but when those arguments be out of my thoughts my mind go the other way there seem to be something so satisfactory natural and intelligible in the modern way of explain things that i confess that i dont know how to reject it i dont know what way you mean i mean the modern way of account for our sensations or ideas how do it do that it be suppose that the mind reside in some part of the brain from which the nerve originate spread out from there to all part of the body that outer object act in different ways on the senseorgans start up certain vibrations in the nerve that the nerve pass these vibrations along to the brain where the mind be locate and that the mind be variously affect with ideas accord to the various impressions or trace the vibrations make in the brain and call you this an explanation of how we be affect with ideas why not philonous have you any objection to it i need to know first whether i have rightly understand your modern hypothesis accord to it certain trace in the brain be the cause or occasion of our ideas the special mean of occasion that be at work here will be explain on page it doesnt matter in the mean time tell me please do you mean by the brain a sensible thing what else do you think i could possibly mean sensible things be all immediately perceivable and things that be immediately perceivable be ideas and these exist only in the mind this much if i be not mistake you have long since agree to i dont deny it so the brain that you speak of be a sensible thing exist only in the mind i would like to know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that one idea or thing exist in the mind occasion all the other ideas and if you do think this how do you account for the origin of that primary idea or brain itself i dont explain the origin of our ideas by the brain which be perceivable to sense because it be as you say only a combination of sensible ideas i be talk about another brain which i imagine but arent imagine things just as much in the mind as perceive things be i must admit that they be so the difference between perceive and imagine isnt important you have be account for ideas by certain motion or impressions in the brain that be by some alterations in an ideaand it doesnt matter whether it be sensible or imaginable i begin to suspect my hypothesis apart from spirit our own ideas be the only things we know or conceive so when you say that all ideas be occasion by impressions in the brain do you conceive this brain or not if you do then you talk of ideas imprint on an idea cause that same idea which be absurd if you dont conceive it you talk unintelligibly instead of form a reasonable hypothesis i can now see clearly that it be a mere dream there be nothing in it its no great loss for after all this way of explain things as you call it could never have satisfy any reasonable man what connection be there between a vibration in the nerve and sensations of sound or colour in the mind how could one possibly cause the other but i could never have see it as be so empty as it now seem to be well then be you finally satisfy that no sensible things have a real existence and that you be in truth a complete sceptic it be too plain to be deny look arent the field cover with a delightful green isnt there something in the woods and groves in the rivers and clear spring that soothe delight transport the soul at the view of the wide and deep ocean or some huge mountain whose top be lose in the cloud or of an old gloomy forest arent our mind fill with a please horror even in rock and desert isnt there an agreeable wildness it be such a sincere pleasure to see earth natural beauties doesnt she preserve and renew our enjoyment of them by intermittently draw the veil of over her face and doesnt she change her dress with the season how aptly the elements be dispose what variety and usefulness even in the lowest things that nature produce what delicacy what beauty what complexity of organization in the body of animals and plant how finely all things be suit to their particular end and also to their roles as appropriate part of the whole and while they mutually aid and support dont they also display each other in a better light raise now your thoughts from this globe of earth to all those glorious glitter object that adorn the high arch of heaven the motion and situation of the planetsarent they admirably orderly have those globes ever be know to stray in their repeat journey through pathless space doesnt each of them sweep out the same area between itself and the sun in any two equal periods of time so fix and unchanging be the laws by which the unseen author of nature run the universe how vivid and radiant be the shine of the fix star how magnificent and rich the careless profusion with which they seem to be scatter throughout the whole vault of the sky yet the telescope bring into view a new host of star that escape the naked eye here they seem to be nearby and small but a closer view through a telescope show them to be immense orb of light at various distance sink deep in the aby of space now you must call imagination to your aid so as to get some imaginative picture of things you cant actually see our feeble limit sense cant pick out innumerable worlds planets revolve round the central fire sun in each of which the energy of an allperfect mind be display in endless form so those be things you must simply imagine but neither sense nor imagination be big enough to take in the boundless extent of the universe with all its glitter furniture with all the hard work that we give to those two faculties exert and strain each of them to its utmost reach theres always a vast surplus leave ungrasped yet all the vast body that make up this mighty universe however distant they may be be by some secret mechanismsome divine power and artificelinked in a mutual dependence and interconnection with each other and with this earth which almost slip out of my thoughts get lose in the crowd of worlds isnt the whole system immense beautiful more glorious than we can say or think then how should we treat those philosophers who want to deprive these noble and delightful scenes of all reality how should we think of principles imply that all the visible beauty of the creation be a false imaginary glare to put it bluntly can you expect this scepticism of yours not to be think extravagantly absurd by all reasonable people other men may think as they please but you have nothing to reproach me with my comfort be that you be as much a sceptic as i be there hylas i beg leave to differ from you what have along agree to the premise be you now deny the conclusion and leave me to maintain by myself these paradoxes that you lead me into this surely isnt fair i deny that i agree with you in those view that lead to scepticism you indeed say that the reality of sensible things consist in an absolute existence out of the mind of spirit or distinct from their be perceive and under the guidance of this notion of reality you be oblige to deny that sensible things have any real existence that be accord to your own definition on page you declare yourself to be a sceptic but i didnt say and didnt think that the reality of sensible things should be define in that manner to me it be evident for the reason you agree to that sensible things cant exist except in a mind or spirit from this i conclude not that they have no real existence but thatseeing they dont depend on my think and have an existence distinct from be perceive by methere must be some other mind in which they exist as sure as the sensible world really exist therefore so sure be there an infinite omnipresent spirit who contain and support it what this be no more than i and all christians holdand indeed all nonchristians who believe there be a god and that he know and understand everything yes but heres the difference men commonly believe that all things be know or perceive by god because they believe in the existence of a god whereas for me the order of reason be reverse i immediately and necessarily conclude the existence of a god because all sensible things must be perceive by him as long as we all believe the same thing what do it matter how we come by that belief but we dont believe the same thing philosophers hold that god perceive all corporeal things but they attribute to such things an absolute existence independently of their be perceive by any mind whatever and i dont besides isnt there a difference between say there be a god therefore he perceive all things and say sensible things do really exist if they really exist they must be perceive by an infinite mind therefore there be an infinite mind or god this provide you with a direct and immediate proof from a most evident premise of the existence of a god theologians and philosophers have prove beyond all controversy from the beauty and usefulness of the various part of the creation that it be the workmanship of god but some of us have the advantage that we can prove the existence of an infinite mind from the bare existence of the sensible world without get help from astronomy and natural philosophy and without bring in facts about how wonderfully the part of the world relate to one another what give us this advantage be just the simple think that the sensible world be what we perceive by our various sense that nothing be perceive by the sense except ideas and that no idea and no thing of which an idea be a copy can exist otherwise than in a mind with that at your disposal you can now oppose and baffle the most strenuous advocate for atheism without any laborious search into the sciences without any sophisticate reason and without tediously long arguments this single reflection on impossibility that the visible world or any part of iteven the most lowgrade and shapeless part of itshould exist outside a mind be enough to overthrow the whole system of atheism it destroy those miserable refuges of the atheist the eternal succession of unthinking cause and effect or the chance come together of atomsthose wild fantasy of vanini hobbes and spinoza let any one of those supporters of impiety look into his own thoughts and see if he can conceive how so much as a rock a desert a chaos or a confuse jumble of atomshow anything at all either sensible or imaginablecan exist independently of a mind and he need go no further to be convince of his folly can anything be fairer than to let the disagreement be settle by the outcome of such a test leave it to the atheist himself to see if he can conceive even in think the state of affairs that he hold to be true in fact it be undeniable that there be something highly serviceable to religion in the position you be take but dont you think it look very like the view of some eminent recent philosophersnotably malebranchethat we see all things in god i would gladly know about that please explain it to me they think that because the soul or mind be immaterial it cant be unite with material things so as to perceive them in themselves but that it perceive them through its union with the substance of god because that be a spiritual substance it be purely intelligible that be capable of be the immediate object of a human mind think furthermore gods essence contain perfections correspond to each create thing and this correspondence enable those perfections to represent create things to the human mind i dont understand how our ideas which be entirely passive and inert can be or be like any part of the essence of god who be indivisible never passive always active this hypothesis be open to many other obvious objections but i shall only add that in make a create world exist otherwise than in the mind of a spirit the hypothesis of malebranche be liable to all the absurdities of the more usual view add to which it have a special absurdity all its own namely that it make the material world serve no purpose if it be valid to argue against other hypotheses in the sciences that they suppose nature or the divine wisdom to make something for no purpose or to employ tedious roundabout methods to get a result which could have be achieve much more easily and swiftly what be we to think of this hypothesis which suppose that the whole world be make for no purpose but dont you also hold that we see all things in god if im not mistake your thesis come near to that few men think but all insist on have opinions which be why mens opinions be superficial and confuse it isnt surprise that doctrines which in themselves be ever so different should nevertheless be confuse with one another by people who dont think hard about them so i shant be surprise if some men imagine that i run into the wild fantasy of malebranche though in truth i be very remote from them he build on the most abstract general ideas which i entirely disclaim he assert an absolute external world which i deny he maintain that we be deceive by our sense and dont know the real natures or the true form and shape of extend things of all which i hold the direct contrary so that overall there be no principles more fundamentally opposite than his and mine i have to say that i entirely agree with what the holy scripture say that in god we live and move and have our be but i be far from believe that we see things in his essence in the manner you have present here be my view in a nutshell it be evident that the things i perceive be my own ideas and that no idea can exist except in a mind it be equally obvious that these ideas or things perceive by meor things of which they be copiesexist independently of my mind because i know that i be not their author it be out of my power to choose what particular ideas i shall experience when i open my eye or ears so they must exist in some other mind who will that they be exhibit to me the things i immediately perceive i repeat be ideas or sensations call them what you will but how can any idea or sensation exist in or be produce by anything other than a mind or spirit that really be inconceivable and to assert something that be inconceivable be to talk nonsense isnt it without doubt on the other side it be very conceivable that ideas or sensations should exist in and be produce by a spirit because this be just what i experience daily in myself when i perceive countless ideas and by an act of my will can form a great variety of them raise them up in my imagination though i have to say that these creatures of my imagination be not as distinct strong vivid and permanent as be the ones i perceive through my sense which latter be call real things from all this i conclude that there be a mind that affect me every moment with all the sensible impressions i perceive and from the variety order and manner of these impressions i conclude that the author of them be wise powerful and good beyond anything i can comprehend please get this straight i do not sayas malebranche doesthat i see things by perceive something that represent them in the intelligible essence of god i dont even understand that what i say be this the things i perceive be know by the understand and produce by the will of an infinite spirit isnt all this very plain and evident be there anything more in it than what a little observation of our own mind and what happen in them not only enable us to conceive but also oblige us to assent to i think i understand you very clearly and i admit that the proof you give of a deity be as convince as it be surprise but grant that god be the supreme and universal cause of all things mightnt there be a third kind of thing besides spirit and ideas may we not admit a subordinate and limit cause of our ideas in a word may there not for all that be matter how often must i teach you the same thing you agree that the things immediately perceive by sense exist nowhere outside the mind but everything that be perceive by sense be perceive immediately therefore there be nothing sensible or perceivable that exist outside the mind so the matter that you still insist on be presumably mean to be something intelligiblesomething that can be discover by reason and not by the sense you be in the right pray let me know what reason your belief in matter be base on and what this matter be in your present sense of the word i find myself affect with various ideas which i know i havent cause and they couldnt cause themselves or cause one another nor could they exist on their own because they be wholly inactive transient dependent be so they have some cause other than me and other than themselves all i claim to know about this be that it be the cause of my ideas and this thing whatever it be i call matter tell me hylas be everyone free to change the current proper mean of a common word in any language for example suppose a traveller tell you that in a certain country men can pass unhurt through the fire and when he explain himself you find that he mean by fire what others call water or suppose he say that there be tree that walk on two legs mean men by the term tree would you think this reasonable no i should think it very absurd common custom be the standard of correctness in language and deliberately to speak improperly be to pervert the use of speech and cant achieve anything except to prolong and multiply dispute when there be no real difference of opinion and doesnt matter in the common current mean of the word signify an extend solid movable unthinking inactive substance it do and hasnt it be make evident that no such substance can possibly exist and even if it do exist how can something inactive be a cause and how can something unthinking be a cause of think you be free to give the word matter a mean that be contrary to its ordinary one and to tell me that you understand by matter an unextended think active be which be the cause of our ideas but this be just play with word commit the very fault that you have just now rightly condemn i dont find fault with your reason in that you infer a cause from the phenomena but i deny that the cause that reason allow you to infer can properly be call matter there be indeed something in what you say but i be afraid you dont properly grasp what i mean i wouldnt want you to take me to be deny that god or an infinite spirit be the supreme cause of all things all i be argue be that subordinate to the supreme agent or cause there be a cause of a limit and lower kind which concur in go along with the production of our ideas not by the action proper to spirit namely act of will but by the action proper to matter namely motion you keep relapse into your old explode notion of a movable and consequently extend substance exist outside the mind what have you already forget what you be convince of do you want me to repeat everything i have say about this really this isnt argue fairly still to assume the existence of something that you have so often admit not to exist but let that go i ask arent all your ideas perfectly passive and inert include no kind of action in them they be and be sensible qualities anything else but ideas how often have i agree that they be not but isnt motion a sensible quality it be consequently it be no action i agree with you and indeed it be obvious that when i move my finger it remain passive but my will that produce the motion be active now i want to know in the first place whether give that motion be not action you can conceive any action other than volition in the second place whether to say something and conceive nothing be not to talk nonsense and lastly whether have consider the premise you dont see that it be highly absurd and unreasonable to suppose that our ideas have any efficient or active cause other than spirit i give up the point entirely but although matter may not be a cause what block it from be an instrument subservient to the supreme agent in the production of our ideas an instrument you say please tell me about the shape spring wheel and motion of that instrument i dont claim to be able to do that because both this substance and its qualities be entirely unknown to me what so you think it be make up of unknown part and have unknown motion and an unknown shape i dont think it have any shape or motion at all because you have convince me that no sensible qualities can exist in an unperceiving substance but what notion can we possibly have of an instrument that have no sensible qualities not even extension i dont claim to have any notion of it and what reason do you have to think that this unknown and inconceivable something do exist be it that you think god can not act as well without it or that you find by experience that some such thing be at work when you form ideas in your own mind you be always nag me for reason for what i believe what reason do you have for not believe it for me see no reason for believe something be a sufficient reason for not believe it but set aside reason for believe you will not so much as let me know what it be you want me to believe since you say you have no sort of notion of it i beg you to consider whether it be like a philosopher or even like a man of common sense to claim to believe you know not what and you know not why hold on philonous when i tell you that matter be an instrument i dont mean absolutely nothing admittedly i dont know what the particular kind of instrument it be but still i have some notion of instrument in general which i apply to it but what if it should turn out that even the most general notion of instrument understand as mean something distinct from cause contain something that make the use of an instrument inconsistent with the divine attribute show me that and i shall give up the point i shall now do so what do you mean by the general nature or notion of instrument the general notion be make up of what be common to all particular instrument dont all instrument have this in common they be use only in do things that cant be perform by the mere act of our will thus for instance i never use an instrument to move my finger because it be do by a volition but i would use an instrument if i want to remove part of a rock or tear up a tree by the root do you agree with this or can you show any example where an instrument be use in produce an effect which immediately depend on the will of the agent i admit that i cant well then how can you suppose that an allperfect spirit on whose will all things absolutely and immediately depend would need an instrument in his operations or that he would use one if he didnt need it thus it seem to me you have to admit that it would be incompatible with the infinite perfection of god for him to use a lifeless inactive instrument such as matter be suppose to be that be your own statements oblige you to give up the point no answer to that come readily to mind there be an answer that should come to your mind you should be ready to admit to the truth when it have be fairly prove to you i shall state the proof again we be whose power be finite be force to make use of instrument and the use of an instrument show that the agent be limit by rule that be prescribe by someone else and not by him and that he can not get what he want except in suchandsuch a way and in suchandsuch condition this seem clearly to imply that the supreme unlimited agent use no tool or instrument at all an omnipotent spirit have only to will that something happen and it happen straight off without the use of any mean when mean be employ by inferior agents like you and me it isnt because of any real causal power that be in them any necessary fitness to produce the desire effect rather it be to comply with the laws of nature or those condition prescribe to us by god the first cause who be himself above all limitation or prescription whatsoever i will no longer maintain that matter be an instrument but dont take me to be give up on its existence because despite everything you have say it may still be an occasion how many shape be your matter to take how often must it be prove not to exist before you be content to let it go by all the laws of debate i be entitle to blame you for so frequently change the mean of the principal term matter but i shant press that point instead i ask you this have already deny matter to be a cause what do you mean when you affirm that it be an occasion and when you have show what you mean by occasion then please show me what reason lead you to believe there be such an occasion of our ideas as to the first point by occasion i mean an inactive unthinking be at the presence of which god cause ideas in our mind and what may be the nature of that inactive unthinking be i know nothing of its nature proceed then to the second point and give me some reason why we should believe in the existence of this inactive unthinking unknown thing when we see ideas produce in our mind in an orderly and constant manner it be natural to think they have some fix and regular occasion at the presence of which they be excite you acknowledge then that god alone be the cause of our ideas and that he cause them in the presence of those occasion that be what i think no doubt god perceive the things that you say be present to him certainly otherwise they couldnt provide him with occasion of act without insist now on your make sense of this hypothesis or on your answer all the puzzle question and difficulties that beset it i merely ask isnt the order and regularity find in the series of our ideasthat be the course of naturesufficiently explain by the wisdom and power of god doesnt it take away from gods wisdom and power to suppose that any unthinking substance influence or direct him concern what to do and when to do it even if i grant you all that you contend for regard matter as gods occasion for act would you get the result you want the point of the last question be that its hard to see how the external or absolute existence of an unthinking substance distinct from its be perceive can be infer from there be certain things perceive by the mind of god which be to him the occasion of produce ideas in us i be utterly at a loss about what to think this notion of occasion now seem to be just as groundless as the rest dont you at last see that in all these different sense of matter you have only be suppose you know not what for no reason and to no purpose i freely admit to have become less fond of my notions since you have examine them in such precise detail but still i think i have some confuse perception that there be such a thing as matter either you perceive the existence of matter immediately or you perceive it mediately if immediately please tell me by which of the sense you perceive it if mediately let me know what reason you employ to infer it from things that you do perceive immediately so much for the perception then for the matter itself i ask whether it be object substratum cause instrument or occasion you have already argue for each of these shift your notions and make matter appear first in one guise and then in another and each thing you have offer have be disapprove and reject by yourself if you have anything new to advance i would gladly hear it i think i have already offer all i have to say on those topics i be at a loss what more to urge and yet youre reluctant to part with your old prejudice but to make it easier for you to drop it i ask you to consideras well as all my other pointsthe question of how you could possibly be affect by matter if it do exist and the question of whether it would make any difference to the ideas you experienceand thus make any difference to your reason to believe in its existenceif matter didnt exist i agree that it be possible we might perceive all things just as we do now without there be any matter in the world and in answer to your first question i cant conceive how matterif there be such a thingcould produce any idea in our mind and i also admit that you have entirely satisfy me that it be impossible for there to be such a thing as matter in any of the previous sense of the term but still i cant help suppose that there be matter in some sense or other i dont claim to settle what sense that be i dont demand that you define exactly the nature of that unknown be just tell me whether it be a substance and if it be whether you can suppose a substance without qualities and if on the other hand you suppose it to have qualities please tell me what those qualities be or at least what it mean to say that matter support them we have already argue on those point i have no more to say about them but to head off any further question let me tell you that i now understand by matter neither substance nor accident think nor extend be neither cause instrument nor occasion but something entirely unknown different from all those it seem then that you include in your present notion of matter nothing but the general abstract of idea of entity or thing nothing else except that i add to this general idea of thing the negation of all those particular things qualities or ideas that i perceive imagine or in any way apprehend where please do you suppose that this unknown matter exist oh philonous now you think you have entangle me for if i say it exist in some place you will infer that it exist in the mind since we agree that place or extension exist only in the mind but i be not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know where it exist but i be sure it doesnt exist in a place there be a negative answer for you and such answer be all you can expect to get for all your remain question about matter since you wont tell me where it exist please inform me about how you suppose it to exist or what you mean by say that it exist it neither think nor act neither perceive nor be perceive but what positive content be there in your abstract notion of its existence when i look into it carefully i dont find that i have any positive notion or mean at all i tell you again i be not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know what be mean by its existence or how it exist keep up this frankness good hylas and tell me sincerely whether you can form a distinct idea of entity in general abstract from and exclude all think and corporeal be all particular things whatsoever hold on let me think a littlei confess philonous i dont find that i can at first glance i think i have some dilute and airy notion of pure entity in abstract but when i focus on it it vanish the more i think about it the more be i confirm in my wise decision to give only negative answer to your question and not to claim the slightest positive knowledge or conception of matter its where its how its entity or anything about it so when you speak of the existence of matter you have no notion in your mind none at all here be where i think we have get to please tell me if i be wrong you attribute existence outside the mind first to the immediate object of our perceptions this come from your belief in material substance then to their archetypesthe things of which they be copy then to their cause then to instrument then to occasion and lastly to something in general which on examination turn out to be nothing so matter come to nothing what do you think hylas isnt this a fair summary of your whole proceed be that as it may yet i still insist that our not be able to conceive a thing be no argument against its existence i freely grant that the existence of a thing that be not immediately perceive may reasonably be infer from a cause effect operation sign or other circumstance and that it would be absurd for any man to argue against the existence of that thing from his have no direct and positive notion of it but where there be nothing of all this where neither reason nor revelation induce us to believe in the existence of a thing we dont have even a relative notion of it what be offer be so abstract that it rise above the distinction between perceive and be perceive between spirit and idea and lastly not even the most inadequate or faint idea of it be claim to exist where all this be the case i shant indeed draw any conclusion against the reality of any notion or against the existence of anything but i shall infer that you mean nothing at all that you be use word to no purpose without any design or mean whatsoever and i leave it to you to consider how such mere jargon should be treat to be frank philonous your arguments seem in themselves unanswerable but their effect on me have not be enough to produce that total conviction that wholehearted agreement that come with demonstration rigorous knockdown proof i find myself still relapse into an obscure surmise of somethingorother that i call matter but dont you realize hylas that two things must cooperate to take away all doubt and produce a complete mental assent however clear the light be in which a visible object be set it wont be distinctly see if there be any imperfection in the vision or if the eye be not direct towards it and however solid and clearly present a demonstration be yet if there be also prejudice or wrong bias in the understand can it be expect all at once to see the truth clearly and adhere to it firmly no for that to happen time and effort be need the attention must be awaken and hold by frequent repetition of the same thingoften in the same light often in different light i have say it already and find i must still repeat it to get you to accept it when you claim to accept you dont know what for you dont know what reason and for you dont know what purpose you be take extraordinary liberties can this be parallel in any art or science any sect or profession of men or be there anything so shamelessly groundless and unreasonable to be meet with even in the lowest of common conversation but you persist in say matter may exist without know what you mean by matter or what you mean by say that it exist what make this especially surprise be the fact that its something you have just decide to say you arent lead to it by any reason at all for i challenge you to show me something in nature that need matter to explain or account for it the reality of things cant be maintain without suppose the existence of matter dont you think this be a good reason why i should be earnest in its defence the reality of things what things sensible or intelligible sensible things my glove for example that or any other thing perceive by the sense let us fix on one particular thing isnt it a sufficient evidence to me of the existence of this glove that i see it and feel it and wear it and if it isnt how could i be assure of the reality of this thing which i actually see in this place by suppose that some unknown thing which i never do or can see exist in an unknown manner in an unknown place or in no place at all how can the suppose reality of something intangible be a proof that anything tangible really exist or of something invisible that any visible thing really exist put generally how can the suppose reality of something imperceptible be a proof of the existence of a perceptible thing explain this and i shall think that nothing be too hard for you overall i be content to admit that the existence of matter be highly improbable but i dont see that it be directly and absolutely impossible even if matter be grant to be possible that doesnt give it a claim to existence any more than a golden mountain or a centaur which be also possible i admit that but still you dont deny that it be possible and something that be possible may for all you know actually exist i do deny it to be possible and i think i have prove that it isnt from premise that you have concede in the ordinary sense of the word matter be anything more imply than an extend solid shape movable substance exist outside the mind and havent you admit over and over that youve see evident reason for deny the possibility of such a substance true but that be only one sense of the term matter but isnt it the only proper genuine commonly accept sense and if matter in such a sense be prove impossible may it not be think with good ground to be absolutely impossible otherwise how could anything be prove impossible indeed how could there be any proof at all of anything to a man who feel free to unsettle and change the common mean of word i think philosophers might be allow to speak more accurately than common people do and be not always confine to the common mean of a term but the mean i have state be the common accept sense among philosophers anyway set that point aside havent i let you take matter in whatever sense you please and havent you use this privilege to the utmost extent sometimes entirely change the mean at others leave out or put into the definition of matter whatever at that moment best serve your purpose contrary to all the know rule of reason and logic and hasnt this shift unfair method of yours spin out our dispute to an unnecessary length matter have be scrutinise in each particular one of those sense and by your own admission refute in each of them and can any more be require to prove the absolute impossibility of a thing than to prove it to be impossible in every particular sense that you or anyone else understand it in i be not so thoroughly satisfy that you have prove the impossibility of matter in the last most obscure abstract and indefinite sense when be a thing show to be impossible when an inconsistency be demonstrate between the ideas contain in its definition but where there be no ideas no contradiction between ideas can be demonstrate i agree with you now consider the sense of the word matter that you have just call obscure and indefinite by your own admission it be obvious that this include no idea at all no senseexcept an unknown sense which be the same thing as none so you cant expect me to prove an inconsistency between ideas where there be no ideas or to prove the impossibility of matter take in an unknown sense that be in no sense at all i aim only to show that you mean nothing and i get you to admit that so that in all your various sense you have be show to mean nothing at all or if something then an absurdity if this isnt sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing i wish you would tell me what be i admit that you have prove that matter be impossible nor do i see what else can be say in defence of it but when i give up matter i come to suspect all my other notions for surely none could be more seemingly evident than this once be yet it now seem as false and absurd as it previously seem true but i think we have discuss the point enough for the present i would like to spend the rest of today run over in my thoughts the various part of this mornings conversation and ill be glad to meet you again here tomorrow at about the same time ill be here the third dialogue philonous tell me hylas what have come of yesterdays meditation have it confirm you in the view you hold when we part or have it give you cause to change your opinion hylas truly my opinion be that all our opinions be equally useless and uncertain what we approve today we condemn tomorrow we make a fuss about knowledge and spend our live in the pursuit of it yet all the time alas we know nothing and i dont think we can ever know anything in this life our faculties be too narrow and too few nature certainly never intend us for speculation for the pursuit of true theories what you say we can know nothing hylas there isnt one single thing in the world whose real nature we can know be you go to tell me that i dont really know what fire or water be you may indeed know that fire appear hot and water fluid but that be merely know what sensations be produce in your own mind when fire or water be apply to your senseorgans you be utterly in the dark as to their internal constitution their true and real nature dont i know that this be a real stone that im stand on and that what i see before my eye be a real tree know no it be impossible that you or any man alive should know it all you know be that you have such and such an idea or appearance in your own mind but what do that have to do with the real tree or stone i tell you the colour shape and hardness that you perceive arent the real natures of those things or in the least like them the same may be say of all other real things or corporeal substances that make up the world none of them have in itself anything like the sensible qualities that we perceive so we shouldnt claim to affirm or know anything about them as they be in their own nature but surely hylas i can distinguish gold for example from iron how could i do that if i didnt know what either truly be believe me philonous you can only distinguish between your own ideas that yellowness that weight and other sensible qualitiesdo you think that they be really in the gold they be only relations to the sense and have no absolute existence in nature and in claim to distinguish the species of real things on the basis of the appearances in your mind you may be act as foolishly as someone who infer that two men be of a different species because their clothe be of different colour it seem then that we be fob off with the appearances of things and false appearances at that the food i eat and the clothe i wear have nothing in them that be like what i see and feel just so but isnt it strange that everyone should be thus deceive and be so foolish as to believe their sense and yet men i dont know how eat and drink and sleep and get on with their live as comfortably and conveniently as if they really know the things they have to deal with they do so but you know ordinary practical affairs dont require precise theoretical knowledge so the common people can retain their mistake and yet manage to bustle through the affairs of life but philosophers know better things you mean they know that they know nothing that be the very peak and perfection of human knowledge but be you serious about all this hylas be you really convince that you know nothing real in the world if you be go to write wouldnt you call for pen ink and paper like anyone else and wouldnt you know what it be you be call for how often must i tell you that i dont know the real nature of any single thing in the universe it be true that i sometimes use pen ink and paper but i declare positively that i dont know what any of them be in its own true nature and the same be true with regard to every other corporeal thing furthermore we be ignorant not only of the true and real nature of things but even of their existence it cant be deny that we perceive certain appearances or ideas but it cant be conclude from this that body really exist indeed now that i think about it my former concessions oblige me to declare that it be impossible that any real corporeal thing should exist in nature you amaze me be ever anything more wild and extravagant than the notions you now maintain isnt it evident that you be lead into all these extravagances by the belief in material substance thats what make you dream of those unknown natures in every thing it be what lead you to distinguish the reality of things from their sensible appearances it be to this that you be indebted for be ignorant of what everyone else know perfectly well nor be this all you be ignorant not only of the true nature of every thing but of whether any thing really exist or whether there be any true natures at all because you attribute to your material be an absolute or external existence and suppose that their reality consist in that as you be eventually force to admit that such an existence mean either a direct contradiction or nothing at all it follow that you be oblige to pull down your own hypothesis of material substance and positively to deny the real existence of any part of the universe and so you be plunge into the deepest and most deplorable scepticism that anyone ever suffer from tell me hylas isnt that what have happen yes it be material substance be no more than an hypothesis and a false and groundless one too i will no longer waste my breath defend it but whatever hypothesis you advance whatever system you introduce in place of it i be sure it will appear every bite as false if you allow me to question you about it allow me to treat you as you have me and ill lead you through as many perplexities and contradictions to the very same state of scepticism that i myself be in at present i assure you hylas i dont claim to formulate any hypothesis at all i have the common man frame of mind i be simple enough to believe my sense and to leave things as i find them heres what i think in plain word the real things be the very things i see and feel and perceive by my sense i know these and because i find that they satisfy all the need and purpose of life i have no reason to worry about any other unknown be a piece of sensible perceptible bread for instance would appease my hunger better than ten thousand time as much of that insensible unintelligible real bread you speak of it be also my opinion that colour and other sensible qualities be in the object i cant for the life of me help think that snow be white and fire hot you indeed who by snow and fire mean certain external unperceived unperceiving substances be right to deny whiten or heat to be qualities inherent in them but i who understand by snow and fire the things i see and feel be oblige to think as other folk do and as i be no sceptic about the nature of things i be not a sceptic either about their existence that a thing should be really perceive by my sense and at the same time not really exist be to me a plain contradiction since i can not abstract even in think the existence of a sensible thing from its be perceive wood stone fire water flesh iron and other such things that i name and talk about be things that i know and i wouldnt have know them if i hadnt perceive them by my sense and things perceive by the sense be immediately perceive and things that be immediately perceive be ideas and ideas cant exist outside the mind so it follow that the existence of things i perceive by my sense consist in be perceive when they be actually perceive therefore there can be no doubt about their existence away then with all that scepticism all those ridiculous philosophical doubt what a joke be it for a philosopher to question the existence of sensible things until it be prove to him from the truthfulness of god or to claim that our knowledge about this fall short of the knowledge we have of things that be obviously selfevident or rigorously prove i might as well doubt my own existence as the existence of the things that i actually see and feel not so fast philonous you say that you cant conceive how sensible things should exist outside the minddont you i do suppose you be annihilate cant you conceive it to be possible that things perceivable by sense might still exist i can but then it must be in another mind when i say that sensible things cant exist out of the mind i dont mean my mind in particular but all mind now they clearly have an existence exterior to my mind since i find by experience that they be independent of it there be therefore some other mind in which they exist during the intervals between the time when i perceive them as likewise they do before my birth and would do after my suppose annihilation and as the same be true with regard to all other finite create mind it necessarily follow that there be an omnipresent eternal mind which know and comprehend all things and let us experience them in a certain manner accord to rule that he himself have ordain and that we call the laws of nature although comprehend can mean understand here it probably mean includesall things be know by and be in the mind of god tell me philonous be all our ideas perfectly inert be or have they any agency include in them they be altogether passive and inert and isnt god an agent a be purely active i agree so an idea can not be like god or represent his nature it can not if you have no idea of the mind of god how can you conceive it to be possible that things exist in his mind that be if you have no idea of his mind how can you have any think about his mind on the other hand if you can have a think about the mind of god without have an idea of him then why cant i conceive the existence of matter without have an idea of it i acknowledge that strictly speak i have no idea either of god or any other spirit for these be active cant be represent by things that be perfectly inert as our ideas be still even though i have no idea of myself because i be a spirit or think substance i know that i exist i know this indeed as certainly as i know that my ideas exist i also know what i mean by the term i and myself and i know this immediately or intuitively though i dont perceive it as i perceive a triangle a colour or a sound the mind spirit soul be the indivisible and unextended thing that think act and perceive it be indivisible because it be unextended and it be unextended because the only extend shape movable things be ideas and something that perceive ideas and that think and will clearly cant itself be an idea ideas be inactive things that be perceive and spirit be things of a totally different sort so i deny that my soul be an idea or like an idea however my soul can be say to furnish me with an idea of god in a broad sense of the word ideathat be an image or liken of god though indeed an extremely inadequate one i get my notion of god by reflect on my own soul heighten its power and remove its imperfections my basic think of god therefore be the think of a thing that be like me except and so on so although i have no inert idea of god in my mind i do have in myself a kind of active image of him because i myself be an image liken of him and though i dont perceive him by sense still i have a notion of him which be to say that i know him by reflection and reason i immediately know my own mind and my own ideas and these give me in an indirect way a grasp of the possibility that other spirit and ideas exist further from the fact that i exist and the fact that i find that my ideas of sense arent cause by me i reason my way to the unavoidable conclusion that a god exist and that all create things exist in his mind so much for your first question by this time you can probably answer your second question for yourself i have show that there be four different ways in which things can come before the mind and none of them be a way in which matter could come before your mind i you dont perceive matter by mentally represent it as you do an inactive be or idea ii nor do you know it as you know yourself by an act of mentally attend to yourself iii you dont understand it indirectly through a resemblance between it and either your ideas or yourself and iv you dont bring it into your mind by reason from what you know immediately all of this make the case of matter widely different from that of god because your knowledge of him involve iii and iv you say that your own soul supply you with a kind of idea or image of god but you admit that strictly speak you have no idea of your soul you even assert that spirit be utterly different in kind from ideas which mean that no idea can be like a spirit which imply that there can be no idea of a spirit so you have no idea of spiritual substance yet you insist that spiritual substance exist on the other hand from your have no idea or notion of material substance you infer that material substance doesnt exist be that fair to be consistent you should either admit matter or reject spirit what do you say to this my answer fall into three part i dont deny the existence of material substance merely because i have no notion of it but because the notion of it be inconsistentto have a notion of it would involve a selfcontradiction for all i know to the contrary there may exist many things of which none of us have or can have any idea or notion whatsoever but such things must be possible ie nothing inconsistent must be include in their definition although we believe in the existence of some things that we dont perceive we oughtnt to believe that any particular thing exist without some reason for think so but i have no reason for believe in the existence of matter i have no immediate intuition of it and i cant infer itrigorously or even by probable inferencefrom my sensations ideas notions action or passions in contrast with this i undeniably know by reflection the existence of myself that be my own soul mind or source of think you will forgive me if i repeat the same things in answer to the same objections the notion or definition of material substance include an obvious inconsistency and that be not so for the notion of spirit that ideas should exist in something that doesnt perceive or be produce by something that doesnt act be inconsistent but there be no inconsistency in say that a perceive thing be the subject of ideas or that an active thing cause them i concede that the existence of other finite spirit be not immediately evident to us nor have we any way of rigorously prove it but that doesnt put such spirit on a level with material substances because there be the follow three differences it be inconsistent to suppose there be matter but not to suppose there be finite spirit there be no argument for matter while there be probable reason in favour of spirit there be no sign or symptoms that make it reasonable to believe in matter but we see sign and effect indicate that there be other finite agents like ourselves although i dont have an idea of spirit if idea be use strictly i do have a notion of it i dont perceive it as an idea or by mean of an idea but i know it by reflection on myself despite all that you have say it seem to me that accord to your own way of think and by your own principles you should conclude that you be only a system of float ideas without any substance to support them word shouldnt be use without a mean and as there be no more mean in spiritual substance than in material substance the former be to be explode as well as the latter how often must i repeat it i know or be conscious of my own existence and i know that i myself be not my ideas but something elsea think active principle here force or source of energy which perceive know will and operate on ideas i know that i one and the same self perceive both colour and sound that a colour can not perceive a sound nor a sound a colour and therefore that i be one individual thing distinct from colour and sound and for the same reason distinct from all other sensible things and inert ideas but i be not in the same way conscious of either the existence or the essence of matter on the contrary i know that nothing inconsistent can exist and that the existence of matter imply an inconsistency furthermore i know what i mean when i assert that there be a spiritual substance or support of ideas that be that a spirit know and perceive ideas but i dont know what people mean when they say that an unperceiving substance contain and support either ideas or items of which ideas be copy so there be no significant liken between spirit and matter i admit to be satisfy about this but do you seriously think that the real existence of sensible things consist in their be actually perceive if so how do it come about that all mankind distinguish between them ask the first man you meet and hell tell you that to be perceive be one thing and to exist be another i be content hylas to appeal to the common sense of the world for the truth of my view ask the gardener why he think that cherry tree over there exist in the garden and he will tell you because he see and feel itin short because he perceive it by his sense ask him why he think there be no orangetree there and he will tell you because he doesnt perceive one when he perceive something by sense he term it a real thing and say that it exist and anything that isnt perceivable he say doesnt exist yes philonous i agree that the existence of a sensible thing consist in be perceivable but not in be actually perceive and what be perceivable but an idea and can an idea exist without be actually perceive these be point long since agree between us however true your view be you must admit that it be shock and contrary to the common sense of men ask your gardener whether that tree have an existence out of his mind what answer do you think he would give you the same answer that i would give namely that it do exist out of his mind but then surely to a christian it cant be shock to say that the real tree exist outside his mind be truly know and comprehend by that be exist in the infinite mind of god probably the gardener wont at first glance be aware of the direct and immediate proof there be of thisnamely that the very existence of a tree or any other perceptible thing imply a mind that contain it but the point itself be one that he cant deny what be at issue between the materialists and me be not whether things have a real existence outside the mind of this or that person but whether they exist outside all mind have an existence that doesnt involve be perceive by god some heathens and philosophers have indeed affirm this but anyone whose notions of god be appropriate to the holy scriptures will think differently but how accord to your view do real things differ from chimeras form by the imagination or the visions of a dream since accord to you they be all equally in the mind the ideas form by the imagination be faint and indistinct also they be entirely dependent on the will but the ideas perceive by sensethat be real thingsare more vivid and clear and they dont in that way depend on our will because they be imprint on our mind by a spirit other than us so theres no danger of mix up these real things with the forego ideas form by the imagination and equally little danger of fail to distinguish them from the visions of a dream which be dim irregular and confuse and even if dream be very lively and natural they could easily be distinguish from realities by their not be coherently connect with the precede and subsequent episodes of our live in short whatever method you use to distinguish things from chimeras be obviously available to me too for any such method must i presume be base on some perceive difference and i dont want to deprive you of any one thing that you perceive but still philonous you hold that there be nothing in the world but spirit and ideas you must admit that this sound very odd i agree that the word idea not be commonly use for thing sound a little peculiar i use it because it imply a necessary relation to the mind and it be now commonly use by philosophers to stand for the immediate object of the understand but however odd the proposition may sound in word theres nothing very strange or shock in what it mean which in effect amount merely to this that there be only perceive things and perceive things or that every unthinking be be necessarilyfrom the very nature of its existenceperceived by some mind if not by any finite create mind then certainly by the infinite mind of god in whom we live and move and have our be be this as strange as to say that sensible qualities arent in the object or that we cant be sure of the existence of things or know anything of their real natures although we see and feel them and perceive them by all our sense dont we have to infer from this that there be no such things as physical or corporeal cause but that a spirit be the immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature can there be anything more extravagant than this yes there can it be infinitely more extravagant to say that an inert thing operate on the mind and an unperceiving thing cause our perceptions anyway the view that you for some reason find so extravagant be no more than the holy scriptures assert in a hundred place in them god be represent as the sole and immediate cause of all those effect that some heathens and philosophers customarily attribute to nature matter fate or some such unthinking agent there be no need for me to support this with particular citationsscripture be full of it you arent aware philonous that in make god the immediate cause of all the motion in nature you make him the author of murder sacrilege adultery and the like heinous sin in answer to that i remark first that a persons guilt be the same whether he perform an action with or without an instrument so if you think that god act through the mediation of an instrument or occasion call matter you make him the author of sin just as much as i do through my view that he be immediate agent in all those operations that common people ascribe to nature i further remark that sin or wickedness do not consist in the outward physical action or movement but in something internalthe will depart from the laws of reason and religion this be clearly so from the fact that kill an enemy in a battle or put a criminal legally to death be not think sinful although the outward act be exactly the same as in murder sin therefore doesnt consist in the physical action so make god an immediate cause of all such action isnt make him the author of sin lastly i have nowhere say that god be the only agent who produce all the motion in body true i have deny there be any agents other than spirit but this be quite consistent with assign to think rational be the use of limit power in the production of motion these power be indeed ultimately derive from god but they be immediately under the direction of the be own will and that be sufficient to entitle them to all the guilt of their action but deny matter philonous or corporeal substance there be the stick point you can never persuade me that this isnt in conflict with the universal sense of mankind if our dispute be to be settle by majority vote i be confident that you would surrender without count the vote i would like both our position to be fairly state and submit to the judgment of men who have plain common sense without the prejudice of a learn education let me be represent as one who trust his sense who think he know the things he see and feel and have no doubt about their existence and you fairly present yourself arm with all your doubt your paradoxes and your scepticism and i shall willingly accept the decision of any unbiased person to me it be obvious that spirit be the only substance in which ideas can exist and everyone agree that the object we immediately perceive be ideas and noone can deny that sensible qualities be object that we immediately perceive it be therefore evident there cant be any substratum of those qualities they can exist in a spirit not as qualities of it but as things perceive by it so i deny that there be any unthinking substratum of the object of sense and that be the mean of my denial that there be any material substance but if by material substance be mean only sensible body that which be see and felt and i dare say that unphilosophical people mean no more then i be more certain of matter existence than you or any other philosopher claim to be if there be anything that turn people in general off from the view that i support it be the mistake idea that i deny the reality of sensible things but it be you who be guilty of that not i so what they be really hostile to be your notions not mine i do therefore assertas something i be as certain of as i be of my own existencethat there be body or corporeal substances mean the things i perceive by my sense most people will agree with this and will neither think nor care about the fate of those unknown natures and essences that some men be so fond of what do you say to this since accord to you men judge the reality of things by their sense how can a man be mistake in think that the moon be a plain shin surface about a foot in diameter or that a square tower see at a distance be round or that an oar with one end in the water be crook he be mistake not with regard to the ideas he actually perceive but in what he infer from his present perceptions thus in the case of the oar what he immediately perceive by sight be certainly crook and to that extent he be right but if he infer from this that when he take the oar out of the water he will see the same crookedness or that it will affect his sense of touch as crook things usually do in that he be mistake likewise if from what he perceive in one place he infer that if he move closer to the moon or tower he will still experience similar ideas he be mistake but his mistake lie not in what he perceive immediately and at present for it be a manifest contradiction to suppose he could err about that but in the wrong judgment he make concern the ideas he think to be connect with the ones he immediately perceive or concern the ideas thatjudging by what he perceive at presenthe think would be perceive in other circumstances the case be the same with regard to the copernican system we dont perceive any motion of the earth while we be stand on it but it would be wrong to infer from this that if we be place at as great a distance from earth as we be now from the other planets we would not then perceive the earth motion i understand you and i have to admit that what you say be plausible enough still let me remind you of something tell me philonous werent you formerly as sure that matter exist as you be now that it do not i be but here lie the difference before my confidence be uncritically base on prejudice but my confidence now after enquiry rest on evidence after all it seem that our dispute be about word rather than things we agree in the thing but differ in the name it be obvious that we be affect with ideas from outside ourselves and it be equally obvious that there must be power outside the mind correspond to those ideas i dont say resemble them and as these power cant exist by themselves we have to postulate some subject of themsome thing that have the powerswhich i call matter and you call spirit this be all the difference hylas be that powerful be or subject of power extend it isnt but it have the power to cause the idea of extension in you in itself therefore it be unextended i grant it be it not also active without doubt otherwise how could we attribute power to it now let me ask you two question first do it conform to the usage of philosophers or of nonphilosophers to give the name matter to an unextended active be second isnt it ridiculously absurd to misapply name contrary to the common use of language well then let it not be call matter since you insist but some third nature distinct from matter and spirit for what reason do you have to call it spirit doesnt the notion of spirit imply that it be think as well as active and unextended my reason be as follow i want to have some notion or mean in what i say but i have no notion of any action other than volition and i cant conceive of volition as be anywhere but in a spirit so when i speak of an active be i be oblige to mean a spirit besides it be quite obvious that a thing that can impart ideas to me must have ideas in itself and if a thing have ideas surely it must be a spirit i shall state the case differently to enable you to understand the point still more clearly if that be possible i assert as you do that since we be affect from outside ourselves we must accept that there be power outside us in some be that be distinct from ourselves up to here we be in agreement but then we differ about what kind of powerful be it be i say it be spirit you say that it be matter or else some third kind of thingi dont know of what kind and nor do you here be how i prove it to be spirit from the effect i see produce i infer that there be action so there be volitions so there must be a will again the things i perceive or things they be copy from must exist outside my mind but because they be ideas neither they nor things they be copy from can exist otherwise than in an understand there be therefore an understand but will and understand constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit the powerful cause of my ideas be therefore something that it be strictly proper to call a spirit i suppose you think you have make the point very clear little suspect that what you propose lead directly to a contradiction it be an absurdity to imagine any imperfection in god be it not without doubt to suffer pain be an imperfection it be be we not sometimes affect with pain and discomfort by some be other than ourselves we be and havent you say that that be be a spirit and be not that spirit god i agree but you have assert that any ideas that we perceive from outside ourselves be in the mind that affect us it follow that the ideas of pain and discomfort be in god or in other word god suffer pain that be to say that there be an imperfection in the divine nature which you agree be absurd so you be catch in a plain contradiction i dont question that god know or understand all things include know what pain be he even know every sort of painful sensation and what it be for his creatures to suffer pain but i positively deny that god though he know and sometimes cause painful sensations in us can himself suffer pain we who be limit and dependent spirit be liable to sensory impressionscaused by an external agent and produce against our willsthat be sometimes painful and distress but god can not suffer anything or be affect with any painful sensation or indeed with any sensation at all because no external be can affect him he perceive nothing by sense as we do his will be absolute and independent cause all things and incapable of be thwart or resist by anything we be chain to a body that be to say our perceptions be connect with bodily motion by the law of our nature we undergo change in our mind with every alteration in the nervous part of our sensible perceptible body this sensible body be really nothing but a complex of qualities or ideas that have no existence other than through be perceive by a mind so that this connection of sensations with bodily motion come down to a mere correspondence in the order of nature between two set of ideas or immediately perceivable thingsthe set of ideas perceive by someones mind and the set constitute his body in contrast with this god be a pure spirit disengage from all such correspondences or linkages accord to laws of nature no bodily motion be accompany by sensations of pain or pleasure in his mind to know everything knowable be certainly a perfection but to endure or suffer or feel anything through the sense be an imperfection the former i repeat fit god but not the latter god know or have ideas but his ideas arent convey to him by sense as ours be what lead you to think you saw an absurdity where really there be none be your failure to attend to this obvious difference between god and his creatures there be a well establish scientific result which imply the existence of matter and you have ignore it throughout all this you havent consider the fact that the quantity of matter have be demonstrate rigorously prove to be proportional to the gravity of body and what can stand up against the force of a demonstration let me see how you demonstrate that point i lay it down for a principle that the quantities of motion in body be directly proportional to their velocities and the quantities of matter contain in them when the velocities of two body be equal therefore their quantities of motion be directly proportional to the quantity of matter in each but it have be find by experience that all body not count small inequalities arise from the resistance of the air fall with an equal velocity and so the motion of fall body and consequently their gravity which be the cause or source of that motion be proportional to the quantity of matter they contain which be what i be to demonstrate you lay it down as a selfevident principle that the quantity of motion in any body be proportional to the velocity and matter take together and this be use to prove a proposition from which the existence of matter be infer isnt this argue in a circle in the premise i only mean that the motion be proportional to the velocity jointly with the extension and solidity so i dont need to use the term matter in the premise but even if this be true it doesnt imply that gravity be proportional to matter in your philosophical sense of the word to get that conclusion you have to take it for grant in your premise that your unknown substratum or whatever else you call it be proportional to those sensible qualities velocity and quantity of motion but to suppose that be plainly assume what be to be prove i readily grant that there be size and solidity or resistance perceive by the sense and i shant dispute the claim that gravity be proportional to those qualities what i do deny be that these qualities as perceive by us or the power produce them exist in a material substratum you affirm this but despite your demonstration you havent yet prove it i shant press that point any further do you expect though to persuade me that natural scientists have be dream all through the years what become of all their hypotheses and explanations of the phenomena which presuppose the existence of matter what do you mean by the phenomena i mean the appearances that i perceive by my sense and the appearances perceive by the sensesarent they ideas i have tell you so a hundred time therefore to explain the phenomena be to show how we come to be affect with ideas in the particular manner and order in which they be imprint on our sense be it not it be now if you can prove that any scientist have explain the production of any one idea in our mind with the help of matter i shall capitulate and regard all that i have say against matter as nothing but if you cant you will get nowhere by urge the explanation of phenomena it be easy to understand that a be endow with knowledge and will should produce or display ideas but i can never understand how a be that be utterly destitute of knowledge and will could produce ideas or in any way to affect a mind even if we have some positive conception of matter know its qualities and could comprehend its existence it would still be so far from explain things that it would itself be the most inexplicable thing in the world from all this however it doesnt follow that scientists have be do nothing for by observe and reason about connections of ideas they discover the laws and methods of nature which be a useful and interest branch of knowledge all the same can it be suppose god would deceive all mankind do you imagine that he would have induce the whole world to believe in the existence of matter if there be no such thing i dont think you will affirm that every widespread opinion arise from prejudice or passion or thoughtlessness may be blame on god as the author of it we arent entitle to lay at his door an opinion of ours unless either he have show it to us by supernatural revelation or it be so evident to our natural faculties which be form and give to us by god that we couldnt possibly withhold our assent from it but where be the supernatural revelation of matter or where be the evidence that compel us to believe in it indeed what be the evidence that matter take for something distinct from what we perceive by our sense be think to exist by all mankind or indeed by any except a few philosophers who dont know what they be say your question presuppose that these point be clear when you have make them so i shall regard myself as oblige to give you another answer in the meantime let it suffice that i tell you that i dont suppose that god have deceive mankind at all but the novelty philonous the novelty there lie the danger new notions should always be discourage they unsettle mens mind and nobody know what they will lead to i cant imagine why reject a notion that have no basis in sense or in reason or in divine authority should be think to unsettle mens hold on beliefs that be ground on all or any of these i freely grant that new opinions about government and religion be dangerous and ought to be discountenance but be there any such reason why they should be discourage in philosophy make anything know that be unknown before introduce a new opinion and if all such new opinions have be forbid what a notable progress men would have make in the arts and sciences but it isnt my concern to plead for novelties and paradoxes that the qualities we perceive be not in the object that we mustnt believe our sense that we know nothing of the real nature of things and can never be assure even that they exist that real colour and sound be nothing but certain unknown shape and motion that motion be in themselves neither swift nor slow that body have absolute extensions without any particular size or shape that a stupid thoughtless and inactive thing operate on a spirit that the tiniest particle of a body contain countless extend part these be the novelties these be the strange notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted judgment of all mankind and have once be accept embarrass the mind with endless doubt and difficulties and it be against these and their like that i try to vindicate common sense it be true that in do this i may have to express myself in some roundabout ways and to use uncommon turn of speech but once my notions be thoroughly understand what be strangest in them will be find to come down merely to this it be absolutely impossible and a plain contradiction to suppose that any unthinking be should exist without be perceive by a mind and if this view be find to be strange it be a shame that it should be so in our age and in a christian country i shant question what you say about the difficulties that other opinions may be liable to but it be your business to defend your own opinion can anything be more obvious than that you support change all things into ideas yes you who be not ashamed to charge me with scepticism this be so obvious that there be no deny it you have me wrong what i support be not change things into ideas but rather ideas into things since those immediate object of perception which you say be only appearances of things be what i take to be the real things themselves things say what you like its certain that all you leave us with be the empty form of things their mere outsides that strike the sense what you call the empty form and outsides of things seem to me to be the things themselves and they arent empty or incomplete except on your supposition that matter be an essential part of all bodily things so you and i agree that we perceive only sensible form but we differ in that you maintain them to be empty appearances while i think they be real be in short you dont trust your sense i do trust mine you say that you believe your sense and you seem to congratulate yourself on agree with common people about this accord to you therefore the true nature of a thing be discover by the sense if so what be the source of the sensory disagreement that we experience why do different ways of perceivingeg sight and touchindicate different shape for the same object and if the true nature of a body can be discover by the naked eye why should a microscope enable us to know it better strictly speak hylas we dont see the same object that we feel and the object perceive through the microscope isnt the same one that be perceive by the naked eye but if every variation be think sufficient to constitute a new kind or new individual language would be make useless by the sheer number of name or by confusions amongst them therefore to avoid this and other inconvenience youll easily see what they be if you think about it men in their think and language treat as one thing a number of ideas that be observe to have some connection in nature either occur together or in sequence although the ideas be certainly distinct from one another because they be perceive through different sense or through one sense at different time or in different circumstances so when i see a thing and then proceed to examine it by my other sense im not try to understand better the same object that i have see that cant be what i be do because the object of one sense cant be perceive by the other sense and when i look through a microscope it isnt so as to perceive more clearly what i have already perceive with my bare eye because the object perceive in these two ways be quite different from one another in each case all i want be to know what ideas be connect together and the more a man know of the connection of ideas the more he be say to know of the nature of things if our ideas be variable and our sense be not always affect with the same appearanceswhat of it it doesnt follow that they arent to be trust or that they be inconsistent either with themselves or with anything else except for your preconceive notion that each name stand for i know not what single unchanged unperceivable real nature a prejudice that seem to have arise from a failure to understand the common language that people use when speak of several distinct ideas as unite into one thing by the mind there be reason to suspect that other erroneous view of the philosophers be due to the same source they found their theories not so much on notions as on word which be invent by the common people merely for convenience and efficiency in the common action of life without any regard to theories i think i follow you you hold that the ideas we perceive by our sense be not real things but image or copy of them so our knowledge be real only to the extent that our ideas be the true representations of those originals but as these suppose originals or real things be in themselves unknown we cant know how far our ideas resemble them or indeed whether they resemble them at all so we cant be sure that we have any real knowledge furthermore while the suppose real things remain unchanged our ideas keep change so they cant all be true copy of the real things and if some be and others be not we cant tell which be which this plunge us yet deeper into uncertainty again when we think about it we cant conceive how any idea or anything like an idea could have an absolute existence out of any mind from which it follow accord to your view that we cant conceive how there should be any real thing in nature because you say that real things be like ideas the result of all this be that we be hopelessly lose in scepticism now let me ask you four question first doesnt all this scepticism arise from your relate ideas to certain absolutely exist unperceived substances as their originals secondly be you inform either by sense or reason of the existence of those unknown originals and if you be not isnt it absurd to suppose that they exist thirdly when you look into it do you find that there be anything distinctly conceive or mean by the absolute or external existence of unperceiving substances lastly have consider the premise that i have put to you isnt it wisest to follow nature trust your sense lay aside all anxious thoughts about unknown natures or substances and join the common people in take the things that be perceive by the sense to be real things just now i be not incline to answer your question i would much rather see how you can answer mine arent the object perceive by one persons sense also perceivable by others who be present if there be a hundred more people here they would all see the garden the tree and flower as i see them but they dont experience in the same way the ideas that i form in my imagination doesnt this make a difference between the former sort of object and the latter i agree that it do and i have never deny that the object of sense be different from those of imagination but what would you infer from this you cant say that sensible object exist unperceived because they be perceive by many people i admit that i cant make anything of that objection of mine but it have lead me to another isnt it your opinion that all we perceive through our sense be the ideas exist in our mind it be but the idea that be in my mind cant be in yours or in any other mind so doesnt it follow from your principles that no two people can see the same thing and isnt this highly absurd if the term same be give its common mean it be certain and not at all in conflict with the principles i maintain that different persons may perceive the same thing and that the same thing or idea can exist in different mind the mean of word be assign by us and since men customarily apply the word same where no distinction or variety be perceive and i dont claim to alter their perceptions it follow that as men have sometimes say several people saw the same thing they may continue to talk like that in similar situations without deviate either from correctness of language or the truth of things but if the term same be use in a mean give to it by philosophers who claim to have an abstract notion of identity then in that sense it may or may not be possible for different people to perceive the same thingdepending on their various definitions of this notion for it isnt yet agree what that philosophical identity consist in but whether philosophers shall think fit to call a thing the same or not be of small importance i think let us suppose a group of men together all have the same faculties and consequently affect in similar ways by their sense but with no use of language there be no doubt that they would agree in their perceptions but when they come to the use of speech they might go different ways in their use of same some of them impress by the uniformness of what be perceive might speak of the same thing while others strike by the diversity of the people whose perceptions be in question might speak of different things but cant anyone see that all the dispute be about a wordnamely a dispute over whether what be perceive by different people can have the term same apply to it or suppose a house whose outer wall remain unaltered while the room be all pull down and new ones build in their place if you be to say that we still have the same house and i say it wasnt the same wouldnt we nevertheless perfectly agree in our thoughts about the house consider in itself wouldnt all the difference consist in a sound if you be to say that in that case we do differ in our notions because your idea of the house include the simple abstract idea of identity whereas mine do not i would tell you that i dont know what you mean by that abstract idea of identity and i would invite you to look into your own thoughts and make sure that you understand yourselfwhy so silent hylas arent you satisfy yet that men can dispute about identity and nonidentity without any real difference in their thoughts and opinions apart from name take this further think with you that this point still stand whether matter exist or not for the materialists themselves admit that what we immediately perceive by our sense be our own ideas so your difficultythat no two see the same thingholds as much against the materialists as against me but they suppose that an idea represent and copy an external thing and they can say truly that several people perceive the same thing mean that their ideas all copy a single external thing you earlier give up on those things that ideas be say to copy but let that pass anyway on my principles also you can suppose that ideas be copy of something external by which i mean external to ones own mind though indeed it must be suppose to exist in that mind which include all things this thingthatiscopied serve all the end of identityproviding a basis for say they perceive the same thingas well as if it exist out of a mind and i be sure you wont say that it be less intelligible than the other you have indeed clearly satisfy me that there be basically no difficulty in this point or that if there be it count equally against both opinions but something that count equally against two contradictory opinions cant be a disproof of either of them i agree but after all philonous when i consider the substance of what you say against scepticism it amount to no more than this we be sure that we really see hear feel in a word we be sure that we be affect with sensible impressions and what more should we be concern with i see this cherry i feel it i taste it and i be sure nothing can not be see or felt or taste so the cherry be not nothing and it be therefore real take away the sensations of softness moisture redness tartness and you take away the cherry since it be not a thing distinct from sensations a cherryi repeatis nothing but a heap of sensible impressions or ideas perceive by various sense these ideas be unite into one thing or have one name give to them by the mind because they be observe to accompany each other thus when the palate be affect with a certain taste the sight be affect with a red colour the sense of touch with roundness softness etc and when i see and feel and taste in certain particular ways i be sure that the cherry exist or be real because i dont think its reality be anything apart from those sensations but if by the word cherry you mean an unknown nature distinct from all those sensible qualities and by its existence you mean something distinct from its be perceive then indeed i agree that neither you nor i nor anyone else can be sure that it exist but what would you say philonous if i bring the very same reason against the existence of sensible things in a mind that you have offer against their exist in a material substratum when i see your reason ill tell you what i have to say to them be the mind extend or unextended unextended without doubt do you say the things you perceive be in your mind they be again have i not hear you speak of sensible impressions i believe you may have explain to me now philonous how there can possibly be room for all those tree and house to exist in your mind can extend things be contain in something that have no size because it be unextended and be we to imagine impressions make on a thing that have no solidity obviously not you cant say that object be in your mind as book be in your study or that things be impress or imprint on your mind as the shape of a seal be imprint on wax in what sense therefore be we to understand those expressions explain this to me if you can and i shall then be able to answer all those question you earlier put to me about my substratum come on hylas when i speak of object as exist in the mind or imprint on the sense i dont mean these in the crude literal sense as when body be say to exist in a place or a seal to make an impression on wax i mean only that the mind comprehend or perceive them and that it be affect from outside or by some be other than itself this be my explanation of your difficulty i would like to know how it can help to make intelligible your thesis of an unperceiving material substratum no if thats all there be to it i admit that i dont see what use can be make of it but be you not guilty of some misuse of language in this none at all i have merely follow what be authorize by common custom which as you know be what set the rule for language for nothing be more usual than for philosophers to speak of the immediate object of the understand as things exist in the mind and this fit with the general analogy of language most mental operations be signify by word borrow from sensible things as can be see in the term comprehend contain understand reflect bounce back look inward discourse etc when these be apply to the mind they must not be take in their crude original sense the word discourse come from latin mean run to and fro and in berkeleys day it could mean reason you have i admit satisfy me about this but there still remain one great difficulty which i dont see how you can overcome indeed it be of such importance that even if you can solve all others if you cant find a solution for this difficulty you mustnt expect to make a convert out of me let me know this mighty difficulty the scriptural account of the creation appear to me to be utterly incompatible with your notions moses tell us of a creation a creation of what of ideas no certainly but of things of real things solid corporeal substances get your principles to conform with this and i shall perhaps agree with you about them in general moses mention the sun moon and star earth and sea plant and animals i dont question that all these do really exist and be in the begin create by god if by ideas you mean fictions and fancy of the mind then the sun moon etc be no ideas if by ideas you mean immediate object of the understand or sensible things that cant exist unperceived or out of a mind then those things be ideas but it matter little whether you call them ideas or not that difference be only about a name and whether that name be retain or reject the sense the truth and reality of things continue the same in common talk the object of our sense be not call ideas but things youll have no quarrel with me if you go on call them things provide you dont attribute to them any absolute external existence so i accept that the creation be a creation of things of real things this isnt in the least inconsistent with my principles as be evident from what i have just be say and would have be evident to you without that if you hadnt forget what i so often say before as for solid corporeal substances please show where moses make any mention of them and if they should be mention by him or any other inspire writer it would still be up to you to show that in such texts those word be not use in the common mean as refer to things fall under our sense but in the philosophical mean as stand for matter or an unknown something with an absolute mindindependent existence when you have prove these point then and not till then you may bring the authority of moses into our dispute it be useless to dispute about a point that be so clear i be content to refer it to your own conscience cant you see that your view conflict in a special way with moses account of the creation if the first chapter of genesis can be give any possible sense that make it square with my principles as well as with any others then that chapter have no special conflict with mine and any such sense can be conceive by you because you believe what i believe all you can conceive apart from spirit be ideas and their existence i dont deny and you like me dont claim that they exist outside the mind please let me see any sense in which you can understand that chapter why i imagine that if i have be present at the creation i would have see things come into existencethat be become perceptiblein the order describe by moses i have always believe moses account of the creation and i dont find that my manner of believe it have alter in any way when things be say to begin or end their existence we mean this with regard not to god but to his creatures all object be eternally know by god or the same thing have an eternal existence in his mind but when things that be previously imperceptible to creatures be by a decree of god make perceptible to them then be they say to come into existence in the sense that they begin a relative existence with respect to create mind so when i read moses account of the creation i understand that the various part of the world gradually become perceivable to finite spirit that be endow with proper faculties so that when such spirit be present the things be in truth perceive by them this be the literal obvious sense suggest to me by the word of the holy scripture and in it there be no mention and no think of substratum instrument occasion or absolute existence and if you look into it i be sure you will find that most plain honest men who believe the creation never think of those things any more than i do what metaphysical sense you may understand the creation story in only you can tell but philonous you seem not to be aware of a terrific problem confront you arise from the fact that accord to you create things in the begin have only a relative existence and thus a hypothetical existence that be to say they exist if there be men to perceive them you dont allow them any actuality of absolute existence that would have enable god to create them and not take the further step of create men so dont you have to say that its plainly impossible that inanimate things be create before man be and isnt this directly contrary to moses account in answer to that i say first create be might begin to exist in the mind of other create intelligences besides men to prove any contradiction between moses account and my notions you must first show that there be no other order of finite create spirit in existence before men for my second reply let us think of the creation as it be at the end of the fourth day a collection of plant of all sort produce by an invisible power in a desert where nobody be present i say that this way of think about the creation be consistent with my principles since they deprive you of nothing sensible and nothing imaginable that it exactly suit with the common natural uncorrupted notions of mankind that it bring out the dependence of all things on god and consequently have all the good effect or influence which that important article of our faith could possibly have in make men humble thankful and resign to their creator i say furthermore that in this naked conception of things with word strip off you wont find any notion of what you call the actuality of absolute existence you may indeed raise a dust with those term and so pointlessly lengthen our dispute but i beg you to look calmly into your own thoughts and then tell me if they arent useless and unintelligible jargon i admit that i have no very clear notion annex to them but what do you say to this dont you make the existence of sensible things consist in their be in a mind and werent all things eternally in the mind of god didnt they therefore exist from all eternity accord to you how could something that be eternal be create in time can anything be clearer or better reason than this dont you also think that god know all things from eternity i do consequently they always have an existence in the divine intellect this i acknowledge by your own admission therefore nothing be new nothing begin to be in respect of the mind of god so we be agree on that point then what be we to make of the creation cant we understand it to have be entirely in respect of finite spirit on that understand of it things with regard to us can properly be say to begin their existence or be create when god decree they should become perceptible to intelligent creatures in the order and manner which he then establish and which we now call the laws of nature you may call this a relative or hypothetical existence if you please but so long as it supply us with the most natural obvious and literal sense of moses history of the creation so long as it answer all the religious end of that great article of faith in a word so long as you can assign no other sense or mean in place of it why should we reject this be it to comply with a ridiculous sceptical desire to make everything nonsense and unintelligible i be sure you cant say it be for the glory of god for even if it be possible and conceivable that the physical world should have an absolute existence outside the mind of god as well as of the mind of all create spirit how could this display either the immensity or the omniscience of the deity or the necessary and immediate dependence of all things on him wouldnt it indeed seem rather to detract from those attribute well let us look into this decree of gods that things should become perceptible isnt it clear philonous that either god carry out that decree from all eternity or at some particular time he begin to will what he hadnt actually will before but only plan to will if the former then there could be no creation or begin of existence for finite things if the latter then we must think that something new happen to god which imply a sort of change and all change point to imperfection please think what you be do isnt it obvious that this objection count equally against a creation in any sense indeed that it count against every other act of gods that we can discover by the light of nature we cant conceive any act of gods otherwise than as perform in time and have a begin god be a be of transcendent and unlimited perfections so finite spirit cant understand his nature it isnt to be expect therefore that any man whether materialist or immaterialist should have exactly correct notions of the deity his attribute and his ways of do things so if you want to infer anything against me your difficulty mustnt be draw from the inadequateness of our conceptions of the divine nature which be unavoidable on any system it must rather come from my denial of matter of which there isnt one word say or hint in what you have just object i have to agree that the only difficulties you have to clear up be ones that arise from the nonexistence of matter and be special to that thesis you be right about that but i simply cant bring myself to think there be no such special conflict between the creation and your opinion though i be not clear about where exactly it be what more do you want dont i acknowledge a twofold state of things the one copy or natural the other copiedfrom and eternal the former be create in time the latter exist from everlasting in the mind of god isnt this in harmony with what theologians generally say be anything more than this necessary in order to conceive the creation but you suspect some special conflict though you can not locate it to take away all possibility of doubt about all this just consider this one point either you cant conceive the creation on any hypothesis whatsoever in which case you have no grind for dislike or complaint against my thesis in particular or you can conceive the creation and in that case why not conceive it on my principles since that would not take away anything conceivable my principles have all along allow you the full scope of sense imagination and reason so anything that you could previously apprehend either immediately by your sense or mediately by inferences from your sense anything you could perceive imagine or understand remain still with you on my principles if therefore the notion you have of the creation by other principles be intelligible you still have it on mine if it isnt intelligible i dont think it be a notion at all and so the loss of it be no loss and indeed it seem to me quite clear that the supposition of mattersomething perfectly unknown and inconceivablecant enable us to conceive anything and i hope i dont need to prove to you that the inference from the creation be inconceivable without matter to matter exist be no good if the existence of matter doesnt make the creation conceivable i admit philonous you have almost satisfy me on this point of the creation i wonder why you arent entirely satisfy you tell me indeed of an inconsistency between moses history and immaterialism but you dont know where it lie be this reasonable hylas can you expect me to solve a difficulty without know what it be but set that aside wouldnt anyone think you be sure that the receive notions of materialists be consistent with holy scripture and so i be ought the historical part of scripture to be understand in a plain obvious sense or in a sense that be metaphysical and out of the way in the plain sense doubtless when moses speak of plant earth water etc as have be create by god dont you think that what this suggest to every unphilosophical reader be the sensible things commonly signify by those word i cant help think so and doesnt the doctrine of materialists deny a real existence to all ideas that be all things perceive by sense i have already agree to this accord to them therefore the creation be not the creation of sensible things that have only a relative existence but of certain unknown natures that have an absolute existenceso that they could exist even if there be no spirit to perceive them true isnt it evident therefore that the friends of matter destroy the plain obvious sense of moses with which their notions be utterly inconsistent and instead of it force on us i know not what something equally unintelligible to themselves and me i cant contradict you moses tell us of a creation a creation of what of unknown essences of occasion or substratums no certainly but of things that be obvious to the sense you must first reconcile this with your notions if you want me to be reconcile to them i see you can attack me with my own weapons then as to absolute existence be there ever know a more povertystricken notion than that it be something so abstract and unintelligible that you have frankly admit to be unable to conceive it much less to explain anything with its help but even if we allow that matter exist and that the notion of absolute existence be as clear as daylight have this ever be know to make the creation more credible on the contrary hasnt it provide the atheists and infidels down through the centuries with their most plausible argument against a creation this thesis a corporeal substance which have an absolute existence outside the mind of spirit be produce out of nothing by the mere will of a spirit have be see as so contrary to all reason so impossible and absurd that not only the most celebrate among the ancients but even a variety of modern and christian philosophers have think matter not to have be create at all but to have exist for ever along with god put these point together and then judge whether materialism dispose men to believe in the creation of things i admit philonous that i dont think it do this creation objection be the last one i can think of and i have to admit that you have sufficiently answer it along with the rest all that remain for me to overcome be a sort of unaccountable resistance that i find in myself towards your notions when a man be sway to one side of a question without know why dont you think that this must be the effect of prejudice which always accompany old and root notions in this respect indeed i cant deny that the belief in matter have very much the advantage over the contrary opinion in the mind of educate men i admit that that seem to be right well then as a counterbalance to this weight of prejudice let us throw into the scale the great advantage that arise from the belief in immaterialism in regard to both religion and human learn the existence of a god and the imperishable nature of the soul those great article of religion arent they prove with the clearest and most immediate evidence when i say the existence of a god i dont mean an obscure general cause of things of which we have no conception but god in the strict and proper sense of the word a be whose spirituality omnipresence providence omniscience infinite power and goodness be as conspicuous as the existence of sensible things of which despite the fallacious claim and pretend doubt of sceptics there be no more reason to doubt than of our own existence then with relation to human knowledge in natural science what intricacies what obscurities what contradictions have the belief in matter lead men into to say nothing of the numberless dispute about its extent continuity homogeneity gravity divisibility etc dont they claim to explain everything in term of body operate on body accord to the laws of motion and yet can they understand how one body might move another furthermore even if there be no difficulty in reconcile the notion of an inert be such as matter with the notion of a cause or in conceive how a quality might pass from one body to another this be one theory about how one body can move another namely by pass some motion along to it yet by all their strain thoughts and extravagant suppositions have the materialists be able to understand the mechanical production of any one animal or plant body can they through the laws of motion account for sound taste smell or colour or for the regular course of events have they through physical principles account for the intricate ways in which even the most inconsiderable part of the universe hang together if on the other hand we set aside matter and corporeal cause and admit only the effectiveness of an allperfect mind dont all the effect of nature become easy and intelligible if the phenomena be nothing but ideas the choice be obvious god be a spirit but matter be unintelligent and unperceiving if the phenomena point to an unlimited power in their cause god be active and omnipotent but matter be an inert mass if the order regularity and usefulness of the effect of nature can never be sufficiently admire god be infinitely wise and provident but matter doesnt have plan and design these surely be great advantage in physics not to mention that the belief in a distant god naturally dispose men to be slack in their moral action which they would be more cautious about if they think god to be immediately present and act on their mind without the interposition of matter or unthinking second cause then in metaphysics what difficulties concern thinghood in the abstract substantial form hylarchic principles plastic natures substance and accident principle of individuation the possibility of matter think the origin of ideas the question of how two independent substances as widely different as spirit and matter could act on each other what difficulties i say and what endless treatises concern these and countless other similar point do we escape by suppose only spirit and ideas even mathematics become much easier and clearer if we take away the absolute existence of extend things the most shock paradoxes and intricate speculations in the mathematical sciences depend on the infinite divisibility of finite extend things and that depend on the supposition of absolutely exist extend things but what need be there to insist on particular sciences isnt the opposition to all systematic knowledge whatsoeverthat frenzy of the ancient and modern scepticsbuilt on the same foundation can you produce so much as one argument against the reality of body or on behalf of that profess utter ignorance of their natures which doesnt presuppose that their reality consist in an external absolute existence once that presupposition be make the objections from the change of colour in a pigeons neck or the break appearance of an oar in the water do have weight but objections like those vanish if we dont maintain the existence of absolute external originals but place the reality of things in ideas although these ideas be fleet and changeable they be change not at random but accord to the fix order of nature for it be thatthe orderliness of our sequence of ideasthat the constancy and truth of things consist in that be what secure all the concern of life and distinguish what be real from the irregular visions of the imagination i agree with everything youve just say and must admit that nothing can incline me to embrace your opinion more than the advantage that i see come with it i be by nature lazy and this accept immaterialism would greatly simplify knowledge what doubt what hypotheses what labyrinths of confusion what field of disputation what an ocean of false learn can be avoid by that single notion of immaterialism be there now anything further to be do you may remember that you promise to accept whatever opinion appear on examination to be the most agreeable to common sense and furthest from scepticism this by your own admission be the opinion that deny matter or the absolute existence of bodily things and we have go further this opinion have be prove in several ways view from different angle pursue in its consequences and defend against all objections to it can there be a greater evidence of its truth or could it have all the mark of a true opinion and yet be false i admit that right now i be entirely satisfy in all respect but how can i be sure that i shall go on fully assent to your opinion and that no new objection or difficulty will turn up tell me hylas when in other case a point have be clearly prove do you withhold your assent on account of objections or difficulties it may be liable to when you be confront with a mathematical demonstration rigorously valid proof do you hold out against it because of the difficulties involve in the doctrine of incommensurable quantities of the angle of contact of the asymptotes to curve or the like or will you disbelieve the providence of god because there be some particular things which you dont know how to reconcile with it if there be difficulties in immaterialism there be at the same time direct and evident proof of it but for the existence of matter there isnt a single proof and there be far more numerous and insurmountable objections count against it anyway where be those mighty difficulties you insist on alas you dont know where or what they be theyre merely something that may possibly turn up in the future if this entitle you to withhold your full assent you should never assent to any proposition however free from objections it may be and however clearly and solidly demonstrate you have satisfy me philonous as armament against all future objections do bear in mind that something bear equally hard on two contradictory opinions can not be a proof against either of them so whenever any difficulty in immaterialism occur to you see if you can find a solution for it on the hypothesis of the materialists dont be deceive by word but test your own thoughts and if you dont find it easier with the help of materialism it obviously cant be an objection against immaterialism if you have follow this rule all along you would probably have spar yourself much trouble in object because none of your objections conform to the rule i challenge you to show one of your difficulties that be explain by matter indeed one that be not make even worse by suppose matter and consequently count against materialism rather than for it in each particular case you should consider whether the difficulty arise from the nonexistence of matter if it doesnt then argue from it to the falsity of immaterialism be argue from a premise to a conclusion that have nothing to do with itno better than argue from extension be infinitely divisible to god do not have foreknowledge and yet if you think back i believe you will find this to have be often if not always the case in our conversation be careful also not to argue by beg the question that be give an argument that at the outset assume the truth of the conclusion one be apt to say the unknown substances ought to be regard as real things rather than the ideas in our mind and for all we know the unthinking external substance may operate as a cause or instrument in the production of our ideas but doesnt this assume that there be such external substances and isnt this beg the question but above all things you should beware of mislead yourself by that common fallacy which be call mistake the questionthat be offer against one proposition an argument which really count only against a quite different proposition you often talk as if you think i maintain the nonexistence of sensible things whereas in truth noone can be more thoroughly assure of their existence than i be and it be you who doubtno it be you who positively denythat they exist everything that be see felt hear or in any way perceive by the sense be a real be accord to the principles i embrace but not accord to the principles that use to be yours remember that the matter you use to defend be an unknown something if indeed it can even be call a something which be completely strip of all sensible qualities and cant be perceive through the sense or grasp by the mind remember i say that your matter be not any object that be hard or soft hot or cold blue or white round or square etc for i affirm that all these things do exist though i do indeed deny that they exist in any way except by be perceive or that they exist out of all mind whatsoever think about these point consider them attentively and keep them in view otherwise you wont be clear about the state of the question and in that case your objections will always be wide of the mark and instead of count against my view they may possibly be direct as more than once they have be against yours i have to admit philonous that nothing seem to have keep me from agree with you more than this same mistake the question that you have just warn me against when you deny matter i be tempt at first glance to think that you be deny the things we see and feel but on reflection i find there be no grind for that how about keep the word matter and apply it to sensible things this could be do without any change in your view and believe me it would reconcile your view to some people who be upset more by your use of word than by your opinions with all my heart retain the word matter and apply it to the object of sense if you please but dont credit them with exist apart from be perceive i shant quarrel with you over a word matter and material substance be term introduce by philosophers and as use by them they imply a sort of independence or an existence distinct from be perceive by a mind but common people dont use these term or if they do it be to signify the immediate object of sense so one would think that so long as the name of all particular things be retain and also such term as sensible substance body and stuff the word matter would never be miss in common talk and in philosophical discourse it seem best to leave it out altogether since the use of that general confuse termmore perhaps than any other one factorhas favour and strengthen the deprave tendency of the mind towards atheism well now philonous since i be content to give up the notion of an unthinking substance exterior to the mind i think you should allow me the privilege of use the word matter as i please to signify a collection of sensible qualities exist only in the mind i freely grant that strictly speak there be no other substance than spirit but i have be accustom to the term matter for so long that i dont know how to get on without it to say there be no matter in the world be still shock to me whereas to say there be no matter if by matter be mean an unthinking substance exist outside the mind but if by matter be mean some sensible thing whose existence consist in be perceive then there be matter come across quite differently and this formulation will bring men to your notions with little difficulty for after all the controversy about matter in the strict sense of matter be not a dispute between you and ordinary folk it lie altogether between you and the philosophers whose principles be admittedly nowhere near so natural or so agreeable to the common sense of mankind and to holy scripture as yours be all our desire be direct towards gain happiness or avoid misery but what have happiness or misery joy or grief pleasure or pain to do with absolute existence or with unknown entities abstract from all relation to us it be obvious that things concern us only insofar as they be please or displease and they can please or displease only to the extent that they be perceive beyond that we be not concern and in this respect you leave things as you find them but still there be something new in this doctrine of yours it be clear to me that i dont now think with the philosophers nor do i entirely think with the common people i would like to know where i stand nowto know precisely what you have add to my former notions or alter in them i dont claim to be a setterup of new notions all im try to do be bring together and place in a clearer light a truth that use to be share between the common people and the philosophers the former be of the opinion that the things they immediately perceive be the real things and the latter that the things they immediately perceive be ideas which exist only in the mind these two notions when put together constitute the substance of what i advance for a long time i have distrust my sense i think i saw things by a dim light and through false glass now the glass be remove and a new light break in on my understand i be clearly convince that i see things as they be and be no longer trouble about their unknown natures or absolute existence this be the state i find myself in at present though indeed i dont yet fully grasp the line of argument that bring me to it you set out on the same principles that academics sceptics in ancient greece cartesians and similar sects usually do and for a long time it look as if you be advance their philosophical scepticism but in the end your conclusions be directly opposite to theirs hylas look at the water of that fountain how it be force upwards in a round column to a certain height at which it break and fall back into the basin from which it rise its ascent as well as its descent come from the same uniform law or principle of gravitation in just that way the same principles which at first view lead to scepticism then when pursue to a certain point bring men back to common sense
