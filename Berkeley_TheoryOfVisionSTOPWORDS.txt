therefore sect thought bigger situation meridian elevation horizon farther air variously impregnated sometimes sometimes less vapours exhalations fitted retund intercept rays light follows appearance horizontal moon hath always equal faintness consequence luminary though situation one time judged greater another given true account phenomena horizontal moon suppose farther evident anyone following considerations first plain case suggests idea greater magnitude must something perceived unperceived cannot suggest perception thing secondly must something constantly remain subject change variation since appearance horizontal moon varies one time greater another yet thirdly cannot visible figure magnitude since remains rather lesser much moon nearer horizon remains therefore true cause affection

horizontal moon far larger usual greatly conspires strengthens opinion neither would prove least irreconcilable said horizontal moon chance sometimes seem enlarged beyond usual extent even serene

therefore sect thought bigger situation meridian elevation horizon farther air variously impregnated sometimes sometimes less vapours exhalations fitted retund intercept rays light follows appearance horizontal moon hath always equal faintness consequence luminary though situation one time judged greater another given true account phenomena horizontal moon suppose farther evident anyone following

therefore sect thought bigger situation meridian elevation horizon farther air variously impregnated sometimes sometimes less vapours exhalations fitted retund intercept rays light follows appearance horizontal moon hath always equal faintness consequence luminary though situation one time judged greater another given true account phenomena horizontal moon suppose farther evident anyone following considerations first plain case suggests idea greater magnitude must something perceived unperceived cannot suggest perception thing secondly must something constantly remain subject change variation since appearance horizontal moon varies one time greater another yet thirdly cannot visible figure magnitude since remains rather lesser much moon nearer horizon remains therefore true cause affection

horizontal moon far larger usual greatly conspires strengthens opinion neither would prove least irreconcilable said horizontal moon chance sometimes seem enlarged beyond usual extent even serene
