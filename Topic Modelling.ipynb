human understanding by john locke to the right honourable lord thomas earl of pembroke and montgomery barron herbert of cardiff lord ross of kendal par fitzhugh marmion st quintin and shurland lord president of his majestys most honourable privy council and lord lieutenant of the county of wilts and of south wales my lord this treatise which is grown up under your lordships eye and has ventured into the world by your order does now by a natural kind of right come to your lordship for that protection which you several years since promised it it is not that i think any name how great soever set at the beginning of a book will be able to cover the faults that are to be found in it things in print must stand and fall by their own worth or the readers fancy but there being nothing more to be desired for truth than a fair unprejudiced hearing nobody is more likely to procure me that than your lordship who are allowed to have got so intimate an acquaintance with her in her more retired recesses your lordship is known to have so far advanced your speculations in the most abstract and general knowledge of things beyond the ordinary reach or common methods that your allowance and approbation of the design of this treatise will at least preserve it from being condemned without reading and will prevail to have those parts a little weighted which might otherwise perhaps be thought to deserve no consideration for being somewhat out of the common road the imputation of novelty is a terrible charge amongst those who judge of mens heads as they do of their perukes by the fashion and can allow none to be right but the received doctrines truth scarce ever yet carried it by vote anywhere at its first appearance new opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common but truth like gold is not the less so for being newly brought out of the mine it is trial and examination must give it price and not any antique fashion and though it be not yet current by the public stamp yet it may for all that be as old as nature and is certainly not the less genuine your lordship can give great and convincing instances of this whenever you please to oblige the public with some of those large and comprehensive discoveries you have made of truths hitherto unknown unless to some few from whom your lordship has been pleased not wholly to conceal them this alone were a sufficient reason were there no other why i should dedicate this essay to your lordship and its having some little correspondence with some parts of that nobler and vast system of the sciences your lordship has made so new exact and instructive a draught of i think it glory enough if your lordship permit me to boast that here and there i have fallen into some thoughts not wholly different from yours if your lordship think fit that by your encouragement this should appear in the world i hope it may be a reason some time or other to lead your lordship further and you will allow me to say that you here give the world an earnest of something that if they can bear with this will be truly worth their expectation this my lord shows what a present i here make to your lordship just such as the poor man does to his rich and great neighbour by whom the basket of flowers or fruit is not ill taken though he has more plenty of his own growth and in much greater perfection worthless things receive a value when they are made the offerings of respect esteem and gratitude these you have given me so mighty and peculiar reasons to have in the highest degree for your lordship that if they can add a price to what they go along with proportionable to their own greatness i can with confidence brag i here make your lordship the richest present you ever received this i am sure i am under the greatest obligations to seek all occasions to acknowledge a long train of favours i have received from your lordship favours though great and important in themselves yet made much more so by the forwardness concern and kindness and other obliging circumstances that never failed to accompany them to all this you are pleased to add that which gives yet more weight and relish to all the rest you vouchsafe to continue me in some degrees of your esteem and allow me a place in your good thoughts i had almost said friendship this my lord your words and actions so constantly show on all occasions even to others when i am absent that it is not vanity in me to mention what everybody knows but it would be want of good manners not to acknowledge what so many are witnesses of and every day tell me i am indebted to your lordship for i wish they could as easily assist my gratitude as they convince me of the great and growing engagements it has to your lordship this i am sure i should write of the understanding without having any if i were not extremely sensible of them and did not lay hold on this opportunity to testify to the world how much i am obliged to be and how much i am my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant john locke dorset court th of may epistle to the reader i have put into thy hands what has been the diversion of some of my idle and heavy hours if it has the good luck to prove so of any of thine and thou hast but half so much pleasure in reading as i had in writing it thou wilt as little think thy money as i do my pains ill bestowed mistake not this for a commendation of my work nor conclude because i was pleased with the doing of it that therefore i am fondly taken with it now it is done he that hawks at larks and sparrows has no less sport though a much less considerable quarry than he that flies at nobler game and he is little acquainted with the subject of this treatise the understandingwho does not know that as it is the most elevated faculty of the soul so it is employed with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other its searches after truth are a sort of hawking and hunting wherein the very pursuit makes a great part of the pleasure every step the mind takes in its progress towards knowledge makes some discovery which is not only new but the best too for the time at least for the understanding like the eye judging of objects only by its own sight cannot but be pleased with what it discovers having less regret for what has escaped it because it is unknown thus he who has raised himself above the almsbasket and not content to live lazily on scraps of begged opinions sets his own thoughts on work to find and follow truth will whatever he lights on not miss the hunters satisfaction every moment of his pursuit will reward his pains with some delight and he will have reason to think his time not ill spent even when he cannot much boast of any great acquisition this reader is the entertainment of those who let loose their own thoughts and follow them in writing which thou oughtest not to envy them since they afford thee an opportunity of the like diversion if thou wilt make use of thy own thoughts in reading it is to them if they are thy own that i refer myself but if they are taken upon trust from others it is no great matter what they are they are not following truth but some meaner consideration and it is not worth while to be concerned what he says or thinks who says or thinks only as he is directed by another if thou judgest for thyself i know thou wilt judge candidly and then i shall not be harmed or offended whatever be thy censure for though it be certain that there is nothing in this treatise of the truth whereof i am not fully persuaded yet i consider myself as liable to mistakes as i can think thee and know that this book must stand or fall with thee not by any opinion i have of it but thy own if thou findest little in it new or instructive to thee thou art not to blame me for it it was not meant for those that had already mastered this subject and made a thorough acquaintance with their own understandings but for my own information and the satisfaction of a few friends who acknowledged themselves not to have sufficiently considered it were it fit to trouble thee with the history of this essay i should tell thee that five or six friends meeting at my chamber and discoursing on a subject very remote from this found themselves quickly at a stand by the difficulties that rose on every side after we had awhile puzzled ourselves without coming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which perplexed us it came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course and that before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature it was necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were or were not fitted to deal with this i proposed to the company who all readily assented and thereupon it was agreed that this should be our first inquiry some hasty and undigested thoughts on a subject i had never before considered which i set down against our next meeting gave the first entrance into this discourse which having been thus begun by chance was continued by intreaty written by incoherent parcels and after long intervals of neglect resumed again as my humour or occasions permitted and at last in a retirement where an attendance on my health gave me leisure it was brought into that order thou now seest it this discontinued way of writing may have occasioned besides others two contrary faults viz that too little and too much may be said in it if thou findest anything wanting i shall be glad that what i have written gives thee any desire that i should have gone further if it seems too much to thee thou must blame the subject for when i put pen to paper i thought all i should have to say on this matter would have been contained in one sheet of paper but the further i went the larger prospect i had new discoveries led me still on and so it grew insensibly to the bulk it now appears in i will not deny but possibly it might be reduced to a narrower compass than it is and that some parts of it might be contracted the way it has been writ in by catches and many long intervals of interruption being apt to cause some repetitions but to confess the truth i am now too lazy or too busy to make it shorter i am not ignorant how little i herein consult my own reputation when i knowingly let it go with a fault so apt to disgust the most judicious who are always the nicest readers but they who know sloth is apt to content itself with any excuse will pardon me if mine has prevailed on me where i think i have a very good one i will not therefore allege in my defence that the same notion having different respects may be convenient or necessary to prove or illustrate several parts of the same discourse and that so it has happened in many parts of this but waiving that i shall frankly avow that i have sometimes dwelt long upon the same argument and expressed it different ways with a quite different design i pretend not to publish this essay for the information of men of large thoughts and quick apprehensions to such masters of knowledge i profess myself a scholar and therefore warn them beforehand not to expect anything here but what being spun out of my own coarse thoughts is fitted to men of my own size to whom perhaps it will not be unacceptable that i have taken some pains to make plain and familiar to their thoughts some truths which established prejudice or the abstractedness of the ideas themselves might render difficult some objects had need be turned on every side and when the notion is new as i confess some of these are to me or out of the ordinary road as i suspect they will appear to others it is not one simple view of it that will gain it admittance into every understanding or fix it there with a clear and lasting impression there are few i believe who have not observed in themselves or others that what in one way of proposing was very obscure another way of expressing it has made very clear and intelligible though afterwards the mind found little difference in the phrases and wondered why one failed to be understood more than the other but everything does not hit alike upon every mans imagination we have our understandings no less different than our palates and he that thinks the same truth shall be equally relished by every one in the same dress may as well hope to feast every one with the same sort of cookery the meat may be the same and the nourishment good yet every one not be able to receive it with that seasoning and it must be dressed another way if you will have it go down with some even of strong constitutions the truth is those who advised me to publish it advised me for this reason to publish it as it is and since i have been brought to let it go abroad i desire it should be understood by whoever gives himself the pains to read it i have so little affection to be in print that if i were not flattered this essay might be of some use to others as i think it has been to me i should have confined it to the view of some friends who gave the first occasion to it my appearing therefore in print being on purpose to be as useful as i may i think it necessary to make what i have to say as easy and intelligible to all sorts of readers as i can and i had much rather the speculative and quicksighted should complain of my being in some parts tedious than that any one not accustomed to abstract speculations or prepossessed with different notions should mistake or not comprehend my meaning it will possibly be censured as a great piece of vanity or insolence in me to pretend to instruct this our knowing age it amounting to little less when i own that i publish this essay with hopes it may be useful to others but if it may be permitted to speak freely of those who with a feigned modesty condemn as useless what they themselves write methinks it savours much more of vanity or insolence to publish a book for any other end and he fails very much of that respect he owes the public who prints and consequently expects men should read that wherein he intends not they should meet with anything of use to themselves or others and should nothing else be found allowable in this treatise yet my design will not cease to be so and the goodness of my intention ought to be some excuse for the worthlessness of my present it is that chiefly which secures me from the fear of censure which i expect not to escape more than better writers mens principles notions and relishes are so different that it is hard to find a book which pleases or displeases all men i acknowledge the age we live in is not the least knowing and therefore not the most easy to be satisfied if i have not the good luck to please yet nobody ought to be offended with me i plainly tell all my readers except half a dozen this treatise was not at first intended for them and therefore they need not be at the trouble to be of that number but yet if any one thinks fit to be angry and rail at it he may do it securely for i shall find some better way of spending my time than in such kind of conversation i shall always have the satisfaction to have aimed sincerely at truth and usefulness though in one of the meanest ways the commonwealth of learning is not at this time without masterbuilders whose mighty designs in advancing the sciences will leave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity but every one must not hope to be a boyle or a sydenham and in an age that produces such masters as the great huygenius and the incomparable mr newton with some others of that strain it is ambition enough to be employed as an underlabourer in clearing the ground a little and removing some of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledgewhich certainly had been very much more advanced in the world if the endeavours of ingenious and industrious men had not been much cumbered with the learned but frivolous use of uncouth affected or unintelligible terms introduced into the sciences and there made an art of to that degree that philosophy which is nothing but the true knowledge of things was thought unfit or incapable to be brought into wellbred company and polite conversation vague and insignificant forms of speech and abuse of language have so long passed for mysteries of science and hard and misapplied words with little or no meaning have by prescription such a right to be mistaken for deep learning and height of speculation that it will not be easy to persuade either those who speak or those who hear them that they are but the covers of ignorance and hindrance of true knowledge to break in upon the sanctuary of vanity and ignorance will be i suppose some service to human understanding though so few are apt to think they deceive or are deceived in the use of words or that the language of the sect they are of has any faults in it which ought to be examined or corrected that i hope i shall be pardoned if i have in the third book dwelt long on this subject and endeavoured to make it so plain that neither the inveterateness of the mischief nor the prevalency of the fashion shall be any excuse for those who will not take care about the meaning of their own words and will not suffer the significancy of their expressions to be inquired into i have been told that a short epitome of this treatise which was printed in was by some condemned without reading because innate ideas were denied in it they too hastily concluding that if innate ideas were not supposed there would be little left either of the notion or proof of spirits if any one take the like offence at the entrance of this treatise i shall desire him to read it through and then i hope he will be convinced that the taking away false foundations is not to the prejudice but advantage of truth which is never injured or endangered so much as when mixed with or built on falsehood in the second edition i added as followeth the bookseller will not forgive me if i say nothing of this new edition which he has promised by the correctness of it shall make amends for the many faults committed in the former he desires too that it should be known that it has one whole new chapter concerning identity and many additions and amendments in other places these i must inform my reader are not all new matter but most of them either further confirmation of what i had said or explications to prevent others being mistaken in the sense of what was formerly printed and not any variation in me from it i must only except the alterations i have made in book ii chap xxi what i had there written concerning liberty and the will i thought deserved as accurate a view as i am capable of those subjects having in all ages exercised the learned part of the world with questions and difficulties that have not a little perplexed morality and divinity those parts of knowledge that men are most concerned to be clear in upon a closer inspection into the working of mens minds and a stricter examination of those motives and views they are turned by i have found reason somewhat to alter the thoughts i formerly had concerning that which gives the last determination to the will in all voluntary actions this i cannot forbear to acknowledge to the world with as much freedom and readiness as i at first published what then seemed to me to be right thinking myself more concerned to quit and renounce any opinion of my own than oppose that of another when truth appears against it for it is truth alone i seek and that will always be welcome to me when or from whencesoever it comes but what forwardness soever i have to resign any opinion i have or to recede from anything i have writ upon the first evidence of any error in it yet this i must own that i have not had the good luck to receive any light from those exceptions i have met with in print against any part of my book nor have from anything that has been urged against it found reason to alter my sense in any of the points that have been questioned whether the subject i have in hand requires often more thought and attention than cursory readers at least such as are prepossessed are willing to allow or whether any obscurity in my expressions casts a cloud over it and these notions are made difficult to others apprehensions in my way of treating them so it is that my meaning i find is often mistaken and i have not the good luck to be everywhere rightly understood of this the ingenious author of the discourse concerning the nature of man has given me a late instance to mention no other for the civility of his expressions and the candour that belongs to his order forbid me to think that he would have closed his preface with an insinuation as if in what i had said book ii ch xxvii concerning the third rule which men refer their actions to i went about to make virtue vice and vice virtue unless he had mistaken my meaning which he could not have done if he had given himself the trouble to consider what the argument was i was then upon and what was the chief design of that chapter plainly enough set down in the fourth section and those following for i was there not laying down moral rules but showing the original and nature of moral ideas and enumerating the rules men make use of in moral relations whether these rules were true or false and pursuant thereto i tell what is everywhere called virtue and vice which alters not the nature of things though men generally do judge of and denominate their actions according to the esteem and fashion of the place and sect they are of if he had been at the pains to reflect on what i had said bk i ch ii sect and bk ii ch xxviii sects and he would have known what i think of the eternal and unalterable nature of right and wrong and what i call virtue and vice and if he had observed that in the place he quotes i only report as a matter of fact what others call virtue and vice he would not have found it liable to any great exception for i think i am not much out in saying that one of the rules made use of in the world for a ground or measure of a moral relation isthat esteem and reputation which several sorts of actions find variously in the several societies of men according to which they are there called virtues or vices and whatever authority the learned mr lowde places in his old english dictionary i daresay it nowhere tells him if i should appeal to it that the same action is not in credit called and counted a virtue in one place which being in disrepute passes for and under the name of vice in another the taking notice that men bestow the names of virtue and vice according to this rule of reputation is all i have done or can be laid to my charge to have done towards the making vice virtue or virtue vice but the good man does well and as becomes his calling to be watchful in such points and to take the alarm even at expressions which standing alone by themselves might sound ill and be suspected tis to this zeal allowable in his function that i forgive his citing as he does these words of mine ch xxviii sect ii even the exhortations of inspired teachers have not feared to appeal to common repute philip iv without taking notice of those immediately preceding which introduce them and run thus whereby even in the corruption of manners the true boundaries of the law of nature which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice were pretty well preserved so that even the exhortations of inspired teachers c by which words and the rest of that section it is plain that i brought that passage of st paul not to prove that the general measure of what men called virtue and vice throughout the world was the reputation and fashion of each particular society within itself but to show that though it were so yet for reasons i there give men in that way of denominating their actions did not for the most part much stray from the law of nature which is that standing and unalterable rule by which they ought to judge of the moral rectitude and gravity of their actions and accordingly denominate them virtues or vices had mr lowde considered this he would have found it little to his purpose to have quoted this passage in a sense i used it not and would i imagine have spared the application he subjoins to it as not very necessary but i hope this second edition will give him satisfaction on the point and that this matter is now so expressed as to show him there was no cause for scruple though i am forced to differ from him in these apprehensions he has expressed in the latter end of his preface concerning what i had said about virtue and vice yet we are better agreed than he thinks in what he says in his third chapter p concerning natural inscription and innate notions i shall not deny him the privilege he claims p to state the question as he pleases especially when he states it so as to leave nothing in it contrary to what i have said for according to him innate notions being conditional things depending upon the concurrence of several other circumstances in order to the souls exerting them all that he says for innate imprinted impressed notions for of innate ideas he says nothing at all amounts at last only to thisthat there are certain propositions which though the soul from the beginning or when a man is born does not know yet by assistance from the outward senses and the help of some previous cultivation it may afterwards come certainly to know the truth of which is no more than what i have affirmed in my first book for i suppose by the souls exerting them he means its beginning to know them or else the souls exerting of notions will be to me a very unintelligible expression and i think at best is a very unfit one in this it misleading mens thoughts by an insinuation as if these notions were in the mind before the soul exerts them ie before they are knownwhereas truly before they are known there is nothing of them in the mind but a capacity to know them when the concurrence of those circumstances which this ingenious author thinks necessary in order to the souls exerting them brings them into our knowledge p i find him express it thus these natural notions are not so imprinted upon the soul as that they naturally and necessarily exert themselves even in children and idiots without any assistance from the outward senses or without the help of some previous cultivation here he says they exert themselves as p that the soul exerts them when he has explained to himself or others what he means by the souls exerting innate notions or their exerting themselves and what that previous cultivation and circumstances in order to their being exerted arehe will i suppose find there is so little of controversy between him and me on the point bating that he calls that exerting of notions which i in a more vulgar style call knowing that i have reason to think he brought in my name on this occasion only out of the pleasure he has to speak civilly of me which i must gratefully acknowledge he has done everywhere he mentions me not without conferring on me as some others have done a title i have no right to there are so many instances of this that i think it justice to my reader and myself to conclude that either my book is plainly enough written to be rightly understood by those who peruse it with that attention and indifferency which every one who will give himself the pains to read ought to employ in reading or else that i have written mine so obscurely that it is in vain to go about to mend it whichever of these be the truth it is myself only am affected thereby and therefore i shall be far from troubling my reader with what i think might be said in answer to those several objections i have met with to passages here and there of my book since i persuade myself that he who thinks them of moment enough to be concerned whether they are true or false will be able to see that what is said is either not well founded or else not contrary to my doctrine when i and my opposer come both to be well understood if any other authors careful that none of their good thoughts should be lost have published their censures of my essay with this honour done to it that they will not suffer it to be an essay i leave it to the public to value the obligation they have to their critical pens and shall not waste my readers time in so idle or illnatured an employment of mine as to lessen the satisfaction any one has in himself or gives to others in so hasty a confutation of what i have written the booksellers preparing for the fourth edition of my essay gave me notice of it that i might if i had leisure make any additions or alterations i should think fit whereupon i thought it convenient to advertise the reader that besides several corrections i had made here and there there was one alteration which it was necessary to mention because it ran through the whole book and is of consequence to be rightly understood what i thereupon said was this clear and distinct ideas are terms which though familiar and frequent in mens mouths i have reason to think every one who uses does not perfectly understand and possibly tis but here and there one who gives himself the trouble to consider them so far as to know what he himself or others precisely mean by them i have therefore in most places chose to put determinate or determined instead of clear and distinct as more likely to direct mens thoughts to my meaning in this matter by those denominations i mean some object in the mind and consequently determined ie such as it is there seen and perceived to be this i think may fitly be called a determinate or determined idea when such as it is at any time objectively in the mind and so determined there it is annexed and without variation determined to a name or articulate sound which is to be steadily the sign of that very same object of the mind or determinate idea to explain this a little more particularly by determinate when applied to a simple idea i mean that simple appearance which the mind has in its view or perceives in itself when that idea is said to be in it by determined when applied to a complex idea i mean such an one as consists of a determinate number of certain simple or less complex ideas joined in such a proportion and situation as the mind has before its view and sees in itself when that idea is present in it or should be present in it when a man gives a name to it i say should be because it is not every one nor perhaps any one who is so careful of his language as to use no word till he views in his mind the precise determined idea which he resolves to make it the sign of the want of this is the cause of no small obscurity and confusion in mens thoughts and discourses i know there are not words enough in any language to answer all the variety of ideas that enter into mens discourses and reasonings but this hinders not but that when any one uses any term he may have in his mind a determined idea which he makes it the sign of and to which he should keep it steadily annexed during that present discourse where he does not or cannot do this he in vain pretends to clear or distinct ideas it is plain his are not so and therefore there can be expected nothing but obscurity and confusion where such terms are made use of which have not such a precise determination upon this ground i have thought determined ideas a way of speaking less liable to mistakes than clear and distinct and where men have got such determined ideas of all that they reason inquire or argue about they will find a great part of their doubts and disputes at an end the greatest part of the questions and controversies that perplex mankind depending on the doubtful and uncertain use of words or which is the same indetermined ideas which they are made to stand for i have made choice of these terms to signify some immediate object of the mind which it perceives and has before it distinct from the sound it uses as a sign of it that this idea thus determined ie which the mind has in itself and knows and sees there be determined without any change to that name and that name determined to that precise idea if men had such determined ideas in their inquiries and discourses they would both discern how far their own inquiries and discourses went and avoid the greatest part of the disputes and wranglings they have with others besides this the bookseller will think it necessary i should advertise the reader that there is an addition of two chapters wholly new the one of the association of ideas the other of enthusiasm these with some other larger additions never before printed he has engaged to print by themselves after the same manner and for the same purpose as was done when this essay had the second impression in the sixth edition there is very little added or altered the greatest part of what is new is contained in the twentyfirst chapter of the second book which any one if he thinks it worth while may with a very little labour transcribe into the margin of the former edition an essay concerning human understanding as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all thingseccles quam bellum est velle confiteri potius nescire quod nescias quam ista effutientem nauseare atque ipsum sibi displicerecicero de natur deor l i an inquiry into the understanding pleasant and useful since it is the understanding that sets man above the rest of sensible beings and gives him all the advantage and dominion which he has over them it is certainly a subject even for its nobleness worth our labour to inquire into the understanding like the eye whilst it makes us see and perceive all other things takes no notice of itself and it requires art and pains to set it at a distance and make it its own object but whatever be the difficulties that lie in the way of this inquiry whatever it be that keeps us so much in the dark to ourselves sure i am that all the light we can let in upon our minds all the acquaintance we can make with our own understandings will not only be very pleasant but bring us great advantage in directing our thoughts in the search of other things design this therefore being my purposeto inquire into the original certainty and extent of human knowledge together with the grounds and degrees of belief opinion and assenti shall not at present meddle with the physical consideration of the mind or trouble myself to examine wherein its essence consists or by what motions of our spirits or alterations of our bodies we come to have any sensation by our organs or any ideas in our understandings and whether those ideas do in their formation any or all of them depend on matter or not these are speculations which however curious and entertaining i shall decline as lying out of my way in the design i am now upon it shall suffice to my present purpose to consider the discerning faculties of a man as they are employed about the objects which they have to do with and i shall imagine i have not wholly misemployed myself in the thoughts i shall have on this occasion if in this historical plain method i can give any account of the ways whereby our understandings come to attain those notions of things we have and can set down any measures of the certainty of our knowledge or the grounds of those persuasions which are to be found amongst men so various different and wholly contradictory and yet asserted somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence that he that shall take a view of the opinions of mankind observe their opposition and at the same time consider the fondness and devotion wherewith they are embraced the resolution and eagerness wherewith they are maintained may perhaps have reason to suspect that either there is no such thing as truth at all or that mankind hath no sufficient means to attain a certain knowledge of it method it is therefore worth while to search out the bounds between opinion and knowledge and examine by what measures in things whereof we have no certain knowledge we ought to regulate our assent and moderate our persuasion in order whereunto i shall pursue this following method first i shall inquire into the original of those ideas notions or whatever else you please to call them which a man observes and is conscious to himself he has in his mind and the ways whereby the understanding comes to be furnished with them secondly i shall endeavour to show what knowledge the understanding hath by those ideas and the certainty evidence and extent of it thirdly i shall make some inquiry into the nature and grounds of faith or opinion whereby i mean that assent which we give to any proposition as true of whose truth yet we have no certain knowledge and here we shall have occasion to examine the reasons and degrees of assent useful to know the extent of our comprehension if by this inquiry into the nature of the understanding i can discover the powers thereof how far they reach to what things they are in any degree proportionate and where they fail us i suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehension to stop when it is at the utmost extent of its tether and to sit down in a quiet ignorance of those things which upon examination are found to be beyond the reach of our capacities we should not then perhaps be so forward out of an affectation of an universal knowledge to raise questions and perplex ourselves and others with disputes about things to which our understandings are not suited and of which we cannot frame in our minds any clear or distinct perceptions or whereof as it has perhaps too often happened we have not any notions at all if we can find out how far the understanding can extend its view how far it has faculties to attain certainty and in what cases it can only judge and guess we may learn to content ourselves with what is attainable by us in this state our capacity suited to our state and concerns for though the comprehension of our understandings comes exceeding short of the vast extent of things yet we shall have cause enough to magnify the bountiful author of our being for that proportion and degree of knowledge he has bestowed on us so far above all the rest of the inhabitants of this our mansion men have reason to be well satisfied with what god hath thought fit for them since he hath given them as st peter says pana pros zoen kaieusebeian whatsoever is necessary for the conveniences of life and information of virtue and has put within the reach of their discovery the comfortable provision for this life and the way that leads to a better how short soever their knowledge may come of an universal or perfect comprehension of whatsoever is it yet secures their great concernments that they have light enough to lead them to the knowledge of their maker and the sight of their own duties men may find matter sufficient to busy their heads and employ their hands with variety delight and satisfaction if they will not boldly quarrel with their own constitution and throw away the blessings their hands are filled with because they are not big enough to grasp everything we shall not have much reason to complain of the narrowness of our minds if we will but employ them about what may be of use to us for of that they are very capable and it will be an unpardonable as well as childish peevishness if we undervalue the advantages of our knowledge and neglect to improve it to the ends for which it was given us because there are some things that are set out of the reach of it it will be no excuse to an idle and untoward servant who would not attend his business by candle light to plead that he had not broad sunshine the candle that is set up in us shines bright enough for all our purposes the discoveries we can make with this ought to satisfy us and we shall then use our understandings right when we entertain all objects in that way and proportion that they are suited to our faculties and upon those grounds they are capable of being proposed to us and not peremptorily or intemperately require demonstration and demand certainty where probability only is to be had and which is sufficient to govern all our concernments if we will disbelieve everything because we cannot certainly know all things we shall do muchwhat as wisely as he who would not use his legs but sit still and perish because he had no wings to fly knowledge of our capacity a cure of scepticism and idleness when we know our own strength we shall the better know what to undertake with hopes of success and when we have well surveyed the powers of our own minds and made some estimate what we may expect from them we shall not be inclined either to sit still and not set our thoughts on work at all in despair of knowing anything nor on the other side question everything and disclaim all knowledge because some things are not to be understood it is of great use to the sailor to know the length of his line though he cannot with it fathom all the depths of the ocean it is well he knows that it is long enough to reach the bottom at such places as are necessary to direct his voyage and caution him against running upon shoals that may ruin him our business here is not to know all things but those which concern our conduct if we can find out those measures whereby a rational creature put in that state in which man is in this world may and ought to govern his opinions and actions depending thereon we need not to be troubled that some other things escape our knowledge occasion of this essay this was that which gave the first rise to this essay concerning the understanding for i thought that the first step towards satisfying several inquiries the mind of man was very apt to run into was to take a survey of our own understandings examine our own powers and see to what things they were adapted till that was done i suspected we began at the wrong end and in vain sought for satisfaction in a quiet and sure possession of truths that most concerned us whilst we let loose our thoughts into the vast ocean of being as if all that boundless extent were the natural and undoubted possession of our understandings wherein there was nothing exempt from its decisions or that escaped its comprehension thus men extending their inquiries beyond their capacities and letting their thoughts wander into those depths where they can find no sure footing it is no wonder that they raise questions and multiply disputes which never coming to any clear resolution are proper only to continue and increase their doubts and to confirm them at last in perfect scepticism whereas were the capacities of our understandings well considered the extent of our knowledge once discovered and the horizon found which sets the bounds between the enlightened and dark parts of things between what is and what is not comprehensible by us men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avowed ignorance of the one and employ their thoughts and discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the other what idea stands for thus much i thought necessary to say concerning the occasion of this inquiry into human understanding but before i proceed on to what i have thought on this subject i must here in the entrance beg pardon of my reader for the frequent use of the word idea which he will find in the following treatise it being that term which i think serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks i have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm notion species or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking and i could not avoid frequently using it i presume it will be easily granted me that there are such ideas in mens minds every one is conscious of them in himself and mens words and actions will satisfy him that they are in others our first inquiry then shall behow they come into the mind neither principles nor ideas are innate no innate speculative principles the way shown how we come by any knowledge sufficient to prove it not innate it is an established opinion amongst some men that there are in the understanding certain innate principles some primary notions koinai ennoiai characters as it were stamped upon the mind of man which the soul receives in its very first being and brings into the world with it it would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced readers of the falseness of this supposition if i should only show as i hope i shall in the following parts of this discourse how men barely by the use of their natural faculties may attain to all the knowledge they have without the help of any innate impressions and may arrive at certainty without any such original notions or principles for i imagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to suppose the ideas of colours innate in a creature to whom god hath given sight and a power to receive them by the eyes from external objects and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truths to the impressions of nature and innate characters when we may observe in ourselves faculties fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of them as if they were originally imprinted on the mind but because a man is not permitted without censure to follow his own thoughts in the search of truth when they lead him ever so little out of the common road i shall set down the reasons that made me doubt of the truth of that opinion as an excuse for my mistake if i be in one which i leave to be considered by those who with me dispose themselves to embrace truth wherever they find it general assent the great argument there is nothing more commonly taken for granted than that there are certain principles both speculative and practical for they speak of both universally agreed upon by all mankind which therefore they argue must needs be the constant impressions which the souls of men receive in their first beings and which they bring into the world with them as necessarily and really as they do any of their inherent faculties universal consent proves nothing innate this argument drawn from universal consent has this misfortune in it that if it were true in matter of fact that there were certain truths wherein all mankind agreed it would not prove them innate if there can be any other way shown how men may come to that universal agreement in the things they do consent in which i presume may be done what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be not universally assented to but which is worse this argument of universal consent which is made use of to prove innate principles seems to me a demonstration that there are none such because there are none to which all mankind give an universal assent i shall begin with the speculative and instance in those magnified principles of demonstration whatsoever is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be which of all others i think have the most allowed title to innate these have so settled a reputation of maxims universally received that it will no doubt be thought strange if any one should seem to question it but yet i take liberty to say that these propositions are so far from having an universal assent that there are a great part of mankind to whom they are not so much as known not on the mind naturally imprinted because not known to children idiots c for first it is evident that all children and idiots have not the least apprehension or thought of them and the want of that is enough to destroy that universal assent which must needs be the necessary concomitant of all innate truths it seeming to me near a contradiction to say that there are truths imprinted on the soul which it perceives or understands not imprinting if it signify anything being nothing else but the making certain truths to be perceived for to imprint anything on the mind without the minds perceiving it seems to me hardly intelligible if therefore children and idiots have souls have minds with those impressions upon them they must unavoidably perceive them and necessarily know and assent to these truths which since they do not it is evident that there are no such impressions for if they are not notions naturally imprinted how can they be innate and if they are notions imprinted how can they be unknown to say a notion is imprinted on the mind and yet at the same time to say that the mind is ignorant of it and never yet took notice of it is to make this impression nothing no proposition can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew which it was never yet conscious of for if any one may then by the same reason all propositions that are true and the mind is capable ever of assenting to may be said to be in the mind and to be imprinted since if any one can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew it must be only because it is capable of knowing it and so the mind is of all truths it ever shall know nay thus truths may be imprinted on the mind which it never did nor ever shall know for a man may live long and die at last in ignorance of many truths which his mind was capable of knowing and that with certainty so that if the capacity of knowing be the natural impression contended for all the truths a man ever comes to know will by this account be every one of them innate and this great point will amount to no more but only to a very improper way of speaking which whilst it pretends to assert the contrary says nothing different from those who deny innate principles for nobody i think ever denied that the mind was capable of knowing several truths the capacity they say is innate the knowledge acquired but then to what end such contest for certain innate maxims if truths can be imprinted on the understanding without being perceived i can see no difference there can be between any truths the mind is capable of knowing in respect of their original they must all be innate or all adventitious in vain shall a man go about to distinguish them he therefore that talks of innate notions in the understanding cannot if he intend thereby any distinct sort of truths mean such truths to be in the understanding as it never perceived and is yet wholly ignorant of for if these words to be in the understanding have any propriety they signify to be understood so that to be in the understanding and not to be understood to be in the mind and never to be perceived is all one as to say anything is and is not in the mind or understanding if therefore these two propositions whatsoever is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be are by nature imprinted children cannot be ignorant of them infants and all that have souls must necessarily have them in their understandings know the truth of them and assent to it that men know them when they come to the use of reason answered to avoid this it is usually answered that all men know and assent to them when they come to the use of reason and this is enough to prove them innate i answer doubtful expressions that have scarce any signification go for clear reasons to those who being prepossessed take not the pains to examine even what they themselves say for to apply this answer with any tolerable sense to our present purpose it must signify one of these two things either that as soon as men come to the use of reason these supposed native inscriptions come to be known and observed by them or else that the use and exercise of mens reason assists them in the discovery of these principles and certainly makes them known to them if reason discovered them that would not prove them innate if they mean that by the use of reason men may discover these principles and that this is sufficient to prove them innate their way of arguing will stand thus viz that whatever truths reason can certainly discover to us and make us firmly assent to those are all naturally imprinted on the mind since that universal assent which is made the mark of them amounts to no more but thisthat by the use of reason we are capable to come to a certain knowledge of and assent to them and by this means there will be no difference between the maxims of the mathematicians and theorems they deduce from them all must be equally allowed innate they being all discoveries made by the use of reason and truths that a rational creature may certainty come to know if he apply his thoughts rightly that way it is false that reason discovers them but how can these men think the use of reason necessary to discover principles that are supposed innate when reason if we may believe them is nothing else but the faculty of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known that certainly can never be thought innate which we have need of reason to discover unless as i have said we will have all the certain truths that reason ever teaches us to be innate we may as well think the use of reason necessary to make our eyes discover visible objects as that there should be need of reason or the exercise thereof to make the understanding see what is originally engraven on it and cannot be in the understanding before it be perceived by it so that to make reason discover those truths thus imprinted is to say that the use of reason discovers to a man what he knew before and if men have those innate impressed truths originally and before the use of reason and yet are always ignorant of them till they come to the use of reason it is in effect to say that men know and know them not at the same time no use made of reasoning in the discovery of these two maxims it will here perhaps be said that mathematical demonstrations and other truths that are not innate are not assented to as soon as proposed wherein they are distinguished from these maxims and other innate truths i shall have occasion to speak of assent upon the first proposing more particularly by and by i shall here only and that very readily allow that these maxims and mathematical demonstrations are in this different that the one have need of reason using of proofs to make them out and to gain our assent but the other as soon as understood are without any the least reasoning embraced and assented to but i withal beg leave to observe that it lays open the weakness of this subterfuge which requires the use of reason for the discovery of these general truths since it must be confessed that in their discovery there is no use made of reasoning at all and i think those who give this answer will not be forward to affirm that the knowledge of this maxim that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be is a deduction of our reason for this would be to destroy that bounty of nature they seem so fond of whilst they make the knowledge of those principles to depend on the labour of our thoughts for all reasoning is search and casting about and requires pains and application and how can it with any tolerable sense be supposed that what was imprinted by nature as the foundation and guide of our reason should need the use of reason to discover it and if there were this would prove them not innate those who will take the pains to reflect with a little attention on the operations of the understanding will find that this ready assent of the mind to some truths depends not either on native inscription or the use of reason but on a faculty of the mind quite distinct from both of them as we shall see hereafter reason therefore having nothing to do in procuring our assent to these maxims if by saying that men know and assent to them when they come to the use of reason be meant that the use of reason assists us in the knowledge of these maxims it is utterly false and were it true would prove them not to be innate the coming to the use of reason not the time we come to know these maxims if by knowing and assenting to them when we come to the use of reason be meant that this is the time when they come to be taken notice of by the mind and that as soon as children come to the use of reason they come also to know and assent to these maxims this also is false and frivolous first it is false because it is evident these maxims are not in the mind so early as the use of reason and therefore the coming to the use of reason is falsely assigned as the time of their discovery how many instances of the use of reason may we observe in children a long time before they have any knowledge of this maxim that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and a great part of illiterate people and savages pass many years even of their rational age without ever thinking on this and the like general propositions i grant men come not to the knowledge of these general and more abstract truths which are thought innate till they come to the use of reason and i add nor then neither which is so because till after they come to the use of reason those general abstract ideas are not framed in the mind about which those general maxims are which are mistaken for innate principles but are indeed discoveries made and verities introduced and brought into the mind by the same way and discovered by the same steps as several other propositions which nobody was ever so extravagant as to suppose innate this i hope to make plain in the sequel of this discourse i allow therefore a necessity that men should come to the use of reason before they get the knowledge of those general truths but deny that mens coming to the use of reason is the time of their discovery by this they are not distinguished from other knowable truths in the mean time it is observable that this saying that men know and assent to these maxims when they come to the use of reason amounts in reality of fact to no more but thisthat they are never known nor taken notice of before the use of reason but may possibly be assented to some time after during a mans life but when is uncertain and so may all other knowable truths as well as these which therefore have no advantage nor distinction from others by this note of being known when we come to the use of reason nor are thereby proved to be innate but quite the contrary if coming to the use of reason were the time of their discovery it would not prove them innate but secondly were it true that the precise time of their being known and assented to were when men come to the use of reason neither would that prove them innate this way of arguing is as frivolous as the supposition itself is false for by what kind of logic will it appear that any notion is originally by nature imprinted in the mind in its first constitution because it comes first to be observed and assented to when a faculty of the mind which has quite a distinct province begins to exert itself and therefore the coming to the use of speech if it were supposed the time that these maxims are first assented to which it may be with as much truth as the time when men come to the use of reason would be as good a proof that they were innate as to say they are innate because men assent to them when they come to the use of reason i agree then with these men of innate principles that there is no knowledge of these general and selfevident maxims in the mind till it comes to the exercise of reason but i deny that the coming to the use of reason is the precise time when they are first taken notice of and if that were the precise time i deny that it would prove them innate all that can with any truth be meant by this proposition that men assent to them when they come to the use of reason is no more but thisthat the making of general abstract ideas and the understanding of general names being a concomitant of the rational faculty and growing up with it children commonly get not those general ideas nor learn the names that stand for them till having for a good while exercised their reason about familiar and more particular ideas they are by their ordinary discourse and actions with others acknowledged to be capable of rational conversation if assent ing to these maxims when men come to the use of reason can be true in any other sense i desire it may be shown or at least how in this or any other sense it proves them innate the steps by which the mind attains several truths the senses at first let in particular ideas and furnish the yet empty cabinet and the mind by degrees growing familiar with some of them they are lodged in the memory and names got to them afterwards the mind proceeding further abstracts them and by degrees learns the use of general names in this manner the mind comes to be furnished with ideas and language the materials about which to exercise its discursive faculty and the use of reason becomes daily more visible as these materials that give it employment increase but though the having of general ideas and the use of general words and reason usually grow together yet i see not how this any way proves them innate the knowledge of some truths i confess is very early in the mind but in a way that shows them not to be innate for if we will observe we shall find it still to be about ideas not innate but acquired it being about those first which are imprinted by external things with which infants have earliest to do which make the most frequent impressions on their senses in ideas thus got the mind discovers that some agree and others differ probably as soon as it has any use of memory as soon as it is able to retain and perceive distinct ideas but whether it be then or no this is certain it does so long before it has the use of words or comes to that which we commonly call the use of reason for a child knows as certainly before it can speak the difference between the ideas of sweet and bitter ie that sweet is not bitter as it knows afterwards when it comes to speak that wormwood and sugarplums are not the same thing assent to supposed innate truths depends on having clear and distinct ideas of what their terms mean and not on their innateness a child knows not that three and four are equal to seven till he comes to be able to count seven and has got the name and idea of equality and then upon explaining those words he presently assents to or rather perceives the truth of that proposition but neither does he then readily assent because it is an innate truth nor was his assent wanting till then because he wanted the use of reason but the truth of it appears to him as soon as he has settled in his mind the clear and distinct ideas that these names stand for and then he knows the truth of that proposition upon the same grounds and by the same means that he knew before that a rod and a cherry are not the same thing and upon the same grounds also that he may come to know afterwards that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be as shall be more fully shown hereafter so that the later it is before any one comes to have those general ideas about which those maxims are or to know the signification of those general terms that stand for them or to put together in his mind the ideas they stand for the later also will it be before he comes to assent to those maximswhose terms with the ideas they stand for being no more innate than those of a cat or a weasel he must stay till time and observation have acquainted him with them and then he will be in a capacity to know the truth of these maxims upon the first occasion that shall make him put together those ideas in his mind and observe whether they agree or disagree according as is expressed in those propositions and therefore it is that a man knows that eighteen and nineteen are equal to thirtyseven by the same selfevidence that he knows one and two to be equal to three yet a child knows this not so soon as the other not for want of the use of reason but because the ideas the words eighteen nineteen and thirtyseven stand for are not so soon got as those which are signified by one two and three assenting as soon as proposed and understood proves them not innate this evasion therefore of general assent when men come to the use of reason failing as it does and leaving no difference between those suppose innate and other truths that are afterwards acquired and learnt men have endeavoured to secure an universal assent to those they call maxims by saying they are generally assented to as soon as proposed and the terms they are proposed in understood seeing all men even children as soon as they hear and under stand the terms assent to these propositions they think it is sufficient to prove them innate for since men never fail after they have once understood the words to acknowledge them for undoubted truths they would infer that certainly these proposit ions were first lodged in the understanding which without any teaching the mind at the very first proposal immediately closes with and assents to and after that never doubts again if such an assent be a mark of innate then that one and two are equal to three that sweetness is not bitterness and a thousand the like must be innate in answer to this i demand whether ready assent given to a proposition upon first hearing and understanding the terms be a certain mark of an innate principle if it be not such a general assent is in vain urged as a proof of them if it be said that it is a mark of innate they must then allow all such propositions to be innate which are generally assented to as soon as heard whereby they will find themselves plentifully stored with innate principles for upon the same ground viz of assent at first hearing and understanding the terms that men would have those maxims pass for innate they must also admit several propositions about numbers to be innate and thus that one and two are equal to three that two and two are equal to four and a multitude of other the like propositions in numbers that everybody assents to at first hearing and understanding the terms must have a place amongst these innate axioms nor is this the prerogative of numbers alone and propositions made about several of them but even natural philosophy and all the other sciences afford propositions which are sure to meet with assent as soon as they are understood that two bodies cannot be in the same place is a truth that nobody any more sticks at than at these maxims that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that white is not black that a square is not a circle that bitterness is not sweetness these and a million of such other propositions as many at least as we have distinct ideas of every man in his wits at first hearing and knowing what the names stand for must necessarily assent to if these men will be true to their own rule and have assent at first hearing and under standing the terms to be a mark of innate they must allow not only as many innate propositions as men have distinct ideas but as many as men can make propositions wherein different ideas are denied one of another since every proposition wherein one different idea is denied of another will as certainly find assent at first hearing and understanding the terms as this general one it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be or that which is the foundation of it and is the easier understood of the two the same is not different by which account they will have legions of innate propositions of this one sort without mentioning any other but since no proposition can be innate unless the ideas about which it is be innate this will be to suppose all our ideas of colours sounds tastes figure c innate than which there cannot be anything more opposite to reason and experience universal and ready assent upon hearing and understanding the terms is i grant a mark of selfevidence but selfevidence depending not on innate impressions but on something else as we shall show hereafter belongs to several propositions which nobody was yet so extravagant as to pretend to be innate such less general propositions known before these universal maxims nor let it be said that those more particular selfevident propositions which are assented to at first hearing as that one and two are equal to three that green is not red c are received as the consequences of those more universal propositions which are looked on as innate principles since any one who will but take the pains to observe what passes in the understanding will certainly find that these and the like less general propositions are certainly known and firmly assented to by those who are utterly ignorant of those more general maxims and so being earlier in the mind than those as they are called first principles cannot owe to them the assent wherewith they are received at first hearing one and one equal to two c not general nor useful answered if it be said that these propositions viz two and two are equal to four red is not blue c are not general maxims nor of any great use i answer that makes nothing to the argument of universal assent upon hearing and understanding for if that be the certain mark of innate whatever proposition can be found that receives general assent as soon as heard and understood that must be admitted for an innate proposition as well as this maxim that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be they being upon this ground equal and as to the difference of being more general that makes this maxim more remote from being innate those general and abstract ideas being more strangers to our first apprehensions than those of more particular selfevident propositions and therefore it is longer before they are admitted and assented to by the growing understanding and as to the usefulness of these magnified maxims that perhaps will not be found so great as is generally conceived when it comes in its due place to be more fully considered these maxims not being known sometimes till proposed proves them not innate but we have not yet done with assenting to propositions at first hearing and understanding their terms it is fit we first take notice that this instead of being a mark that they are innate is a proof of the contrary since it supposes that several who understand and know other things are ignorant of these principles till they are proposed to them and that one may be unacquainted with these truths till he hears them from others for if they were innate what need they be proposed in order to gaining assent when by being in the understanding by a natural and original impression if there were any such they could not but be known before or doth the proposing them print them clearer in the mind than nature did if so then the consequence will be that a man knows them better after he has been thus taught them than he did before whence it will follow that these principles may be made more evident to us by others teaching than nature has made them by impression which will ill agree with the opinion of innate principles and give but little authority to them but on the contrary makes them unfit to be the foundations of all our other knowledge as they are pretended to be this cannot be denied that men grow first acquainted with many of these selfevident truths upon their being proposed but it is clear that whosoever does so finds in himself that he then begins to know a proposition which he knew not before and which from thenceforth he never questions not because it was innate but because the consideration of the nature of the things contained in those words would not suffer him to think otherwise how or whensoever he is brought to reflect on them and if whatever is assented to at first hearing and understanding the terms must pass for an innate principle every wellgrounded observation drawn from particulars into a general rule must be innate when yet it is certain that not all but only sagacious heads light at first on these observations and reduce them into general propositions not innate but collected from a preceding acquaintance and reflection on particular instances these when observing men have made them unobserving men when they are proposed to them cannot refuse their assent to implicitly known before proposing signifies that the mind is capable of understanding them or else signifies nothing if it be said the understanding hath an implicit knowledge of these principles but not an explicit before this first hearing as they must who will say that they are in the understanding before they are known it will be hard to conceive what is meant by a principle imprinted on the understanding implicitly unless it be thisthat the mind is capable of understanding and assenting firmly to such propositions and thus all mathematical demonstrations as well as first principles must be received as native impressions on the mind which i fear they will scarce allow them to be who find it harder to demonstrate a proposition than assent to it when demonstrated and few mathematicians will be forward to believe that all the diagrams they have drawn were but copies of those innate characters which nature had engraven upon their minds the argument of assenting on first hearing is upon a false supposition of no precedent teaching there is i fear this further weakness in the foregoing argument which would persuade us that therefore those maxims are to be thought innate which men admit at first hear ing because they assent to propositions which they are not taught nor do receive from the force of any argument or demonstration but a bare explication or understanding of the terms under which there seems to me to lie this fallacy that men are supposed not to be taught nor to learn anything de novo when in truth they are taught and do learn something they were ignorant of before for first it is evident that they have learned the terms and their signification neither of which was born with them but this is not all the acquired knowledge in the case the ideas themselves about which the proposition is are not born with them no more than their names but got afterwards so that in all propositions that are assented to at first hearing the terms of the proposition their standing for such ideas and the ideas themselves that they stand for being neither of them innate i would fain know what there is remaining in such propositions that is innate for i would gladly have any one name that proposition whose terms or ideas were either of them innate we by degrees get ideas and names and learn their appropriated connexion one with another and then to propositions made in such terms whose signification we have learnt and wherein the agreement or disagreement we can perceive in our ideas when put together is expressed we at first hearing assent though to other propositions in themselves as certain and evident but which are concerning ideas not so soon or so easily got we are at the same time no way capable of assenting for though a child quickly assents to this proposition that an apple is not fire when by familiar acquaintance he has got the ideas of those two different things distinctly imprinted on his mind and has learnt that the names apple and fire stand for them yet it will be some years after perhaps before the same child will assent to this proposition that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be because that though perhaps the words are as easy to be learnt yet the signification of them being more large comprehensive and abstract than of the names annexed to those sensible things the child hath to do with it is longer before he learns their precise meaning and it requires more time plainly to form in his mind those general ideas they stand for till that be done you will in vain endeavour to make any child assent to a proposition made up of such general terms but as soon as ever he has got those ideas and learned their names he forwardly closes with the one as well as the other of the forementioned propositions and with both for the same reason viz because he finds the ideas he has in his mind to agree or disagree according as the words standing for them are affirmed or denied one of another in the proposition but if propositions be brought to him in words which stand for ideas he has not yet in his mind to such propositions however evidently true or false in themselves he affords neither assent nor dissent but is ignorant for words being but empty sounds any further than they are signs of our ideas we cannot but assent to them as they correspond to those ideas we have but no further than that but the showing by what steps and ways knowledge comes into our minds and the grounds of several degrees of assent being the business of the following discourse it may suffice to have only touched on it here as one reason that made me doubt of those innate principles not innate because not universally assented to to conclude this argument of universal consent i agree with these defenders of innate principlesthat if they are innate they must needs have universal assent for that a truth should be innate and yet not assented to is to me as unintelligible as for a man to know a truth and be ignorant of it at the same time but then by these mens own confession they cannot be innate since they are not assented to by those who understand not the terms nor by a great part of those who do understand them but have yet never heard nor thought of those propositions which i think is at least one half of mankind but were the number far less it would be enough to destroy universal assent and thereby show these propositions not to be innate if children alone were ignorant of them these maxims not the first known but that i may not be accused to argue from the thoughts of infants which are unknown to us and to conclude from what passes in their understandings before they express it i say next that these two general propositions are not the truths that first possess the minds of children nor are antecedent to all acquired and adventitious notions which if they were innate they must needs be whether we can determine it or no it matters not there is certainly a time when children begin to think and their words and actions do assure us that they do so when therefore they are capable of thought of knowledge of assent can it rationally be supposed they can be ignorant of those notions that nature has imprinted were there any such can it be imagined with any appearance of reason that they perceive the impressions from things without and be at the same time ignorant of those characters which nature itself has taken care to stamp within can they receive and assent to adventitious notions and be ignorant of those which are supposed woven into the very principles of their being and imprinted there in indelible characters to be the foundation and guide of all their acquired knowledge and future reasonings this would be to make nature take pains to no purpose or at least to write very ill since its characters could not be read by those eyes which saw other things very well and those are very ill supposed the clearest parts of truth and the foundations of all our knowledge which are not first known and without which the undoubted knowledge of several other things may be had the child certainly knows that the nurse that feeds it is neither the cat it plays with nor the blackmoor it is afraid of that the wormseed or mustard it refuses is not the apple or sugar it cries for this it is certainly and undoubtedly assured of but will any one say it is by virtue of this principle that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that it so firmly assents to these and other parts of its knowledge or that the child has any notion or apprehension of that proposition at an age wherein yet it is plain it knows a great many other truths he that will say children join in these general abstract speculations with their suckingbottles and their rattles may perhaps with justice be thought to have more passion and zeal for his opinion but less sincerity and truth than one of that age and so not innate though therefore there be several general propositions that meet with constant and ready assent as soon as proposed to men grown up who have attained the use of more general and abstract ideas and names standing for them yet they not being to be found in those of tender years who nevertheless know other things they cannot pretend to universal assent of intelligent persons and so by no means can be supposed innateit being impossible that any truth which is innate if there were any such should be unknown at least to any one who knows anything else since if they are innate truths they must be innate thoughts there being nothing a truth in the mind that it has never thought on whereby it is evident if there by any innate truths they must necessarily be the first of any thought on the first that appear not innate because they appear least where what is innate shows itself clearest that the general maxims we are discoursing of are not known to children idiots and a great part of mankind we have already sufficiently proved whereby it is evident they have not an universal assent nor are general impressions but there is this further argument in it against their being innate that these characters if they were native and original impressions should appear fairest and clearest in those persons in whom yet we find no footsteps of them and it is in my opinion a strong presumption that they are not innate since they are least known to those in whom if they were innate they must needs exert themselves with most force and vigour for children idiots savages and illiterate people being of all others the least corrupted by custom or borrowed opinions learning and education having not cast their native thoughts into new moulds nor by superinducing foreign and studied doctrines confounded those fair characters nature had written there one might reasonably imagine that in their minds these innate notions should lie open fairly to every ones view as it is certain the thoughts of children do it might very well be expected that these principles should be perfectly known to naturals which being stamped immediately on the soul as these men suppose can have no dependence on the constitution or organs of the body the only confessed difference between them and others one would think according to these mens principles that all these native beams of light were there any such should in those who have no reserves no arts of concealment shine out in their full lustre and leave us in no more doubt of their being there than we are of their love of pleasure and abhorrence of pain but alas amongst children idiots savages and the grossly illiterate what general maxims are to be found what universal principles of knowledge their notions are few and narrow borrowed only from those objects they have had most to do with and which have made upon their senses the frequentest and strongest impressions a child knows his nurse and his cradle and by degrees the playthings of a little more advanced age and a young savage has perhaps his head filled with love and hunting according to the fashion of his tribe but he that from a child untaught or a wild inhabitant of the woods will expect these abstract maxims and reputed principles of science will i fear find himself mistaken such kind of general propositions are seldom mentioned in the huts of indians much less are they to be found in the thoughts of children or any impressions of them on the minds of naturals they are the language and business of the schools and academies of learned nations accustomed to that sort of conversation or learning where disputes are frequent these maxims being suited to artificial argumentation and useful for conviction but not much conducing to the discovery of truth or advancement of knowledge but of their small use for the improvement of knowledge i shall have occasion to speak more at large c recapitulation i know not how absurd this may seem to the masters of demonstration and probably it will hardly go down with anybody at first hearing i must therefore beg a little truce with prejudice and the forbearance of censure till i have been heard out in the sequel of this discourse being very willing to submit to better judgments and since i impartially search after truth i shall not be sorry to be convinced that i have been too fond of my own notions which i confess we are all apt to be when application and study have warmed our heads with them upon the whole matter i cannot see any ground to think these two speculative maxims innate since they are not universally assented to and the assent they so generally find is no other than what several propositions not allowed to be innate equally partake in with them and since the assent that is given them is produced another way and comes not from natural inscription as i doubt not but to make appear in the following discourse and if these first principles of knowledge and science are found not to be innate no other speculative maxims can i suppose with better right pretend to be so no innate practical principles no moral principles so clear and so generally received as the forementioned speculative maxims if those speculative maxims whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter have not an actual universal assent from all mankind as we there proved it is much more visible concerning practical principles that they come short of an universal reception and i think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as what is is or to be so manifest a truth as this that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other not that it brings their truth at all in question they are equally true though not equally evident those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them but moral principles require reasoning and discourse and some exercise of the mind to discover the certainty of their truth they lie not open as natural characters engraven on the mind which if any such were they must needs be visible by themselves and by their own light be certain and known to everybody but this is no derogation to their truth and certainty no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as the whole is bigger than a part nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing it may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration and there fore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them but the ignorance wherein many men are of them and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them are manifest proofs that they are not innate and such as offer themselves to their view without searching faith and justice not owned as principles by all men whether there be any such moral principles wherein all men do agree i appeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of mankind and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys where is that practical truth that is universally received without doubt or question as it must be if innate justice and keeping of contracts is that which most men seem to agree in this is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves and the confederacies of the greatest villains and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself keep faith and rules of justice one with another i grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature they practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellowhighwayman and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with justice and truth are the common ties of society and therefore even outlaws and robbers who break with all the world besides must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves or else they cannot hold together but will any one say that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to objection though men deny them in their practice yet they admit them in their thoughts answered perhaps it will be urged that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts i answer first i have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts but since it is certain that most mens practices and some mens open professions have either questioned or denied these principles it is impossible to establish an universal consent though we should look for it only amongst grown men without which it is impossible to conclude them innate secondly it is very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles that terminate only in contemplation practical principles derived from nature are there for operation and must produce conformity of action not barely speculative assent to their truth or else they are in vain distinguished from speculative maxims nature i confess has put into man a desire of happiness and an aversion to misery these indeed are innate practical principles which as practical principles ought do continue constantly to operate and influence all our actions without ceasing these may be observed in all persons and all ages steady and universal but these are inclinations of the appetite to good not impressions of truth on the understanding i deny not that there are natural tendencies imprinted on the minds of men and that from the very first instances of sense and perception there are some things that are grateful and others unwelcome to them some things that they incline to and others that they fly but this makes nothing for innate characters on the mind which are to be the principles of knowledge regulating our practice such natural impressions on the understanding are so far from being confirmed hereby that this is an argument against them since if there were certain characters imprinted by nature on the understanding as the principles of knowledge we could not but perceive them constantly operate in us and influence our knowledge as we do those others on the will and appetite which never cease to be the constant springs and motives of all our actions to which we perpetually feel them strongly impelling us moral rules need a proof ergo not innate another reason that makes me doubt of any innate practical principles is that i think there cannot any one moral rule be proposed whereof a man may not justly demand a reason which would be perfectly ridiculous and absurd if they were innate or so much as selfevident which every innate principle must needs be and not need any proof to ascertain its truth nor want any reason to gain it approbation he would be thought void of com mon sense who asked on the one side or on the other side went to give a reason why it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be it carries its own light and evidence with it and needs no other proof he that understands the terms assents to it for its own sake or else nothing will ever be able to prevail with him to do it but should that most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue that one should do as he would be done unto be proposed to one who never heard of it before but yet is of capacity to understand its meaning might he not without any absurdity ask a reason why and were not he that proposed it bound to make out the truth and reasonableness of it to him which plainly shows it not to be innate for if it were it could neither want nor receive any proof but must needs at least as soon as heard and understood be received and assented to as an unquestionable truth which a man can by no means doubt of so that the truth of all these moral rules plainly depends upon some other antecedent to them and from which they must be deduced which could not be if either they were innate or so much as selfevident instance in keeping compacts that men should keep their compacts is certainly a great and undeniable rule in morality but yet if a christian who has the view of happiness and misery in another life be asked why a man must keep his word he will give this as a reason because god who has the power of eternal life and death requires it of us but if a hobbist be asked why he will answerbecause the public requires it and the leviathan will punish you if you do not and if one of the old philosophers had been asked he would have answered because it was dishonest below the dignity of a man and opposite to virtue the highest perfection of human nature to do otherwise virtue generally approved not because innate but because profitable hence naturally flows the great variety of opinions concerning moral rules which are to be found among men according to the different sorts of happiness they have a prospect of or propose to themselves which could not be if practical principles were innate and imprinted in our minds immediately by the hand of god i grant the existence of god is so many ways manifest and the obedience we owe him so congruous to the light of reason that a great part of mankind give testimony to the law of nature but yet i think it must be allowed that several moral rules may receive from mankind a very general approbation without either knowing or admitting the true ground of morality which can only be the will and law of a god who sees men in the dark has in his hand rewards and punishments and power enough to call to account the proudest offender for god having by an inseparable connexion joined virtue and public happiness together and made the practice thereof necessary to the preservation of society and visibly beneficial to all with whom the virtuous man has to do it is no wonder that every one should not only allow but recommend and magnify those rules to others from whose observance of them he is sure to reap advantage to himself he may out of interest as well as conviction cry up that for sacred which if once trampled on and profaned he himself cannot be safe nor secure this though it takes nothing from the moral and eternal obligation which these rules evidently have yet it shows that the outward acknowledgment men pay to them in their words proves not that they are innate principles nay it proves not so much as that men assent to them inwardly in their own minds as the inviolable rules of their own practice since we find that selfinterest and the conveniences of this life make many men own an outward profession and approbation of them whose actions sufficiently prove that they very little consider the lawgiver that prescribed these rules nor the hell that he has ordained for the punishment of those that transgress them mens actions convince us that the rule of virtue is not their internal principle for if we will not in civility allow too much sincerity to the professions of most men but think their actions to be the interpreters of their thoughts we shall find that they have no such internal veneration for these rules nor so full a persuasion of their certainty and obligation the great principle of morality to do as one would be done to is more commended than practised but the breach of this rule can not be a greater vice than to teach others that it is no moral rule nor obligatory would be thought madness and contrary to that interest men sacrifice to when they break it themselves perhaps conscience will be urged as checking us for such breaches and so the internal obligation and establishment of the rule be preserved conscience no proof of any innate moral rule to which i answer that i doubt not but without being written on their hearts many men may by the same way that they come to the knowledge of other things come to assent to several moral rules and be convinced of their obligation others also may come to be of the same mind from their education company and customs of their country which persuasion however got will serve to set conscience on work which is nothing else but our own opinion or judgment of the moral rectitude or pravity of our own actions and if conscience be a proof of innate principles contraries may be innate principles since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid instances of enormities practised without remorse but i cannot see how any men should ever transgress those moral rules with confidence and serenity were they innate and stamped upon their minds view but an army at the sacking of a town and see what observation or sense of moral principles or what touch of conscience for all the outrages they do robberies murders rapes are the sports of men set at liberty from punishment and censure have there not been whole nations and those of the most civilized people amongst whom the exposing their children and leaving them in the fields to perish by want or wild beasts has been the practice as little condemned or scrupled as the begetting them do they not still in some countries put them into the same graves with their mothers if they die in childbirth or despatch them if a pretended astrologer declares them to have unhappy stars and are there not places where at a certain age they kill or expose their parents without any remorse at all in a part of asia the sick when their case comes to be thought desperate are carried out and laid on the earth before they are dead and left there exposed to wind and weather to perish without assistance or pity it is familiar among the mingrelians a people professing christianity to bury their children alive without scruple there are places where they eat their own children the caribbees were wont to geld their children on purpose to fat and eat them and garcilasso de la vega tells us of a people in peru which were wont to fat and eat the children they got on their female captives whom they kept as concubines for that purpose and when they were past breeding the mothers themselves were killed too and eaten the virtues whereby the tououpinambos believed they merited paradise were revenge and eating abundance of their enemies they have not so much as a name for god and have no religion no worship the saints who are canonized amongst the turks lead lives which one cannot with modesty relate a remarkable passage to this purpose out of the voyage of baumgarten which is a book not every day to be met with i shall set down at large in the language it is published in ibi sc prope belbes in ægypto vidimus sanctum unum saracenicum inter arenarum cumulos ita ut ex utero matris prodiit nudum sedentem mosest ut didicimus mahometistis ut eos qui amentes et sine ratione sunt prosanctis colant et venerentur insuper et eos qui cum diu vitam egerint inquinatissimam voluntariam demum poenitentiam et paupertatem sanctitate venerandos deputant ejusmodi vero genus hominum libertatem quandam effrenem habent domos quos volunt intrandi edendi bibendi et quod majus est concumbendi ex quo concubitu si proles secuta fuerit sancta similiter habetur his ergo hominibus dum vivunt magnos exhibent honores mortuis vero vel templa vel monumenta extruunt amplissima eosque contingere ac sepelire maximae fortunae ducunt loco audivimus haec dicta et dicenda per interpretem a mucrelo nostro insuper sanctum illum quem eo loco vidimus publicitus apprime commendari eum esse hominem sanctum divinum ac integritate praecipuum eo quod nec foeminarum unquam esset nec puerorum sed tantummodo asellarum concubitor atque mularum peregr baumgarten ii c i p more of the same kind concerning these precious saints amongst the turks may be seen in pietro della valle in his letter of the th of january where then are those innate principles of justice piety gratitude equity chastity or where is that universal consent that assures us there are such inbred rules murders in duels when fashion has made them honourable are committed without remorse of conscience nay in many places innocence in this case is the greatest ignominy and if we look abroad to take a view of men as they are we shall find that they have remorse in one place for doing or omitting that which others in another place think they merit by men have contrary practical principles he that will carefully peruse the history of mankind and look abroad into the several tribes of men and with indifferency survey their actions will be able to satisfy himself that there is scarce that principle of morality to be named or rule of virtue to be thought on those only excepted that are absolutely necessary to hold society together which commonly too are neglected betwixt distinct societies which is not somewhere or other slighted and condemned by the general fashion of whole societies of men governed by practical opinions and rules of living quite opposite to others whole nations reject several moral rules here perhaps it will be objected that it is no argument that the rule is not known because it is broken i grant the objection good where men though they transgress yet disown not the law where fear of shame censure or punishment carries the mark of some awe it has upon them but it is impossible to conceive that a whole nation of men should all publicly reject and renounce what every one of them certainly and infallibly knew to be a law for so they must who have it naturally imprinted on their minds it is possible men may sometimes own rules of morality which in their private thoughts they do not believe to be true only to keep themselves in reputation and esteem amongst those who are persuaded of their obligation but it is not to be imagined that a whole society of men should publicly and professedly disown and cast off a rule which they could not in their own minds but be infallibly certain was a law nor be ignorant that all men they should have to do with knew it to be such and therefore must every one of them apprehend from others all the contempt and abhorrence due to one who professes himself void of humanity and one who confounding the known and natural measures of right and wrong cannot but be looked on as the professed enemy of their peace and happiness whatever practical principle is innate cannot but be known to every one to be just and good it is therefore little less than a contradiction to suppose that whole nations of men should both in their professions and practice unanimously and universally give the lie to what by the most invincible evidence every one of them knew to be true right and good this is enough to satisfy us that no practical rule which is anywhere universally and with public approbation or allowance transgressed can be supposed innatebut i have something further to add in answer to this objection the generally allowed breach of a rule proof that it is not innate the breaking of a rule say you is no argument that it is unknown i grant it but the generally allowed breach of it anywhere i say is a proof that it is not innate for example let us take any of these rules which being the most obvious deductions of human reason and comformable to the natural inclination of the greatest part of men fewest people have had the impudence to deny or inconsideration to doubt of if any can be thought to be naturally imprinted none i think can have a fairer pretence to be innate than this parents preserve and cherish your children when therefore you say that this is an innate rule what do you mean either that it is an innate principle which upon all occasions excites and directs the actions of all men or else that it is a truth which all men have imprinted on their minds and which therefore they know and assent to but in neither of these senses is it innate first that it is not a principle which influences all mens actions is what i have proved by the examples before cited nor need we seek so far as mingrelia or peru to find instances of such as neglect abuse nay and destroy their children or look on it only as the more than brutality of some savage and barbarous nations when we remember that it was a familiar and uncondemned practice amongst the greeks and romans to expose without pity or remorse their innocent infants secondly that it is an innate truth known to all men is also false for parents preserve your children is so far from an innate truth that it is no truth at all it being a command and not a proposition and so not capable of truth or falsehood to make it capable of being assented to as true it must be reduced to some such proposition as this it is the duty of parents to preserve their children but what duty is cannot be understood without a law nor a law be known or supposed without a lawmaker or without reward and punishment so that it is impossible that this or any other practical principle should be innate ie be imprinted on the mind as a duty without supposing the ideas of god of law of obligation of punishment of a life after this innate for that punishment follows not in this life the breach of this rule and consequently that it has not the force of a law in countries where the generally allowed practice runs counter to it is in itself evident but these ideas which must be all of them innate if anything as a duty be so are so far from being innate that it is not every studious or thinking man much less every one that is born in whom they are to be found clear and distinct and that one of them which of all others seems most likely to be innate is not so i mean the idea of god i think in the next chapter will appear very evident to any considering man if men can be ignorant of what is innate certainty is not described by innate principles from what has been said i think we may safely conclude that whatever practical rule is in any place generally and with allowance broken cannot be supposed innate it being impossible that men should without shame or fear confidently and serenely break a rule which they could not but evidently know that god had set up and would certainly punish the breach of which they must if it were innate to a degree to make it a very ill bargain to the transgressor without such a knowledge as this a man can never be certain that anything is his duty ignorance or doubt of the law hopes to escape the knowl edge or power of the lawmaker or the like may make men give way to a present appetite but let any one see the fault and the rod by it and with the transgression a fire ready to punish it a pleasure tempting and the hand of the almighty visibly held up and prepared to take vengeance for this must be the case where any duty is imprinted on the mind and then tell me whether it be possible for people with such a prospect such a certain knowledge as this wantonly and without scruple to offend against a law which they carry about them in indelible characters and that stares them in the face whilst they are breaking it whether men at the same time that they feel in themselves the imprinted edicts of an omnipotent lawmaker can with assurance and gaiety slight and trample underfoot his most sacred injunctions and lastly whether it be possible that whilst a man thus openly bids defiance to this innate law and supreme lawgiver all the bystanders yea even the governors and rulers of the people full of the same sense both of the law and lawmaker should silently connive without testifying their dislike or laying the least blame on it principles of actions indeed there are lodged in mens appetites but these are so far from being innate moral principles that if they were left to their full swing they would carry men to the overturning of all morality moral laws are set as a curb and restraint to these exorbitant desires which they cannot be but by rewards and punishments that will overbalance the satisfaction any one shall propose to himself in the breach of the law if therefore anything be imprinted on the minds of all men as a law all men must have a certain and unavoidable knowledge that certain and unavoidable punishment will attend the breach of it for if men can be ignorant or doubtful of what is innate innate principles are insisted on and urged to no purpose truth and certainty the things pretended are not at all secured by them but men are in the same uncertain floating estate with as without them an evident indubitable knowledge of unavoidable punishment great enough to make the transgression very uneligible must accompany an innate law unless with an innate law they can suppose an innate gospel too i would not here be mistaken as if because i deny an innate law i thought there were none but positive laws there is a great deal of difference between an innate law and a law of nature between something imprinted on our minds in their very original and something that we being ignorant of may attain to the knowledge of by the use and due application of our natural faculties and i think they equally forsake the truth who running into contrary extremes either affirm an innate law or deny that there is a law knowable by the light of nature ie without the help of positive revelation those who maintain innate practical principles tell us not what they are the difference there is amongst men in their practical principles is so evident that i think i need say no more to evince that it will be impossible to find any innate moral rules by this mark of general assent and it is enough to make one suspect that the supposition of such innate principles is but an opinion taken up at pleasure since those who talk so confidently of them are so sparing to tell us which they are this might with justice be expected from those men who lay stress upon this opinion and it gives occasion to distrust either their knowledge or charity who declaring that god has imprinted on the minds of men the foundations of knowledge and the rules of living are yet so little favourable to the information of their neighbours or the quiet of mankind as not to point out to them which they are in the variety men are distracted with but in truth were there any such innate principles there would be no need to teach them did men find such innate propositions stamped on their minds they would easily be able to distinguish them from other truths that they afterwards learned and deduced from them and there would be nothing more easy than to know what and how many they were there could be no more doubt about their number than there is about the number of our fingers and it is like then every system would be ready to give them us by tale but since nobody that i know has ventured yet to give a catalogue of them they cannot blame those who doubt of these innate principles since even they who require men to believe that there are such innate propo sitions do not tell us what they are it is easy to foresee that if different men of different sects should go about to give us a list of those innate practical principles they would set down only such as suited their distinct hypotheses and were fit to support the doctrines of their particular schools or churches a plain evidence that there are no such innate truths nay a great part of men are so far from finding any such innate moral principles in themselves that by denying freedom to mankind and thereby making men no other than bare machines they take away not only innate but all moral rules whatsoever and leave not a possibility to believe any such to those who cannot conceive how anything can be capable of a law that is not a free agent and upon that ground they must necessarily reject all principles of virtue who cannot put morality and mechanism together which are not very easy to be reconciled or made consistent lord herberts innate principles examined when i had written this being informed that my lord herbert had in his book de veritate assigned these innate principles i presently consulted him hoping to find in a man of so great parts something that might satisfy me in this point and put an end to my inquiry in his chapter de instinctu naturali p ed i met with these six marks of his notitiae communes prioritas independentia universalitas certitudo necessitas ie as he explains it faciunt ad hominis conservationem modus conformationis ie assensus mulla interposita mora and at the latter end of his little treatise de religione laici he says this of these innate principles adeo ut non uniuscujusvis religionis confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent veritates sunt enim in ipsa mente caelitus descriptae nullisque traditionibus sive scriptis sive non scriptis obnoxiae p and veritates nostrae catholicae quae tanquam indubia dei emata inforo interiori descriptae thus having given the marks of the innate principles or common notions and asserted their being imprinted on the minds of men by the hand of god he proceeds to set them down and they are these esse aliquod supremum numen numen illud coli debere virtutem cum pietate conjunctam optimam esse rationem cultus divini resipiscendum esse a peccatis dari praemium vel paenam post hanc vitam transactam though i allow these to be clear truths and such as if rightly explained a rational creature can hardly avoid giving his assent to yet i think he is far from proving them innate impressions in foro interiori descriptae for i must take leave to observe these five either not all or more than all if there are any first that these five propositions are either not all or more than all those common notions written on our minds by the finger of god if it were reasonable to believe any at all to be so written since there are other propositions which even by his own rules have as just a pretence to such an original and may be as well admitted for innate principles as at least some of these five he enumerates viz do as thou wouldst be done unto and perhaps some hundreds of others when well considered the supposed marks wanting secondly that all his marks are not to be found in each of his five propositions viz his first second and third marks agree perfectly to neither of them and the first second third fourth and sixth marks agree but ill to his third fourth and fifth propositions for besides that we are assured from history of many men nay whole nations who doubt or disbelieve some or all of them i cannot see how the third viz that virtue joined with piety is the best worship of god can be an innate principle when the name or sound virtue is so hard to be understood liable to so much uncertainty in its signification and the thing it stands for so much contended about and difficult to be known and therefore this cannot be but a very uncertain rule of human practice and serve but very little to the conduct of our lives and is therefore very unfit to be assigned as an innate practical principle of little use if they were innate for let us consider this proposition as to its meaning for it is the sense and not sound that is and must be the principle or common notion viz virtue is the best worship of god ie is most acceptable to him which if virtue be taken as most commonly it is for those actions which according to the different opinions of several countries are accounted laudable will be a proposition so far from being certain that it will not be true if virtue be taken for actions conformable to gods will or to the rule prescribed by godwhich is the true and only measure of virtue when virtue is used to signify what is in its own nature right and goodthen this proposition that virtue is the best worship of god will be most true and certain but of very little use in human life since it will amount to no more but this viz that god is pleased with the doing of what he commandswhich a man may certainly know to be true without knowing what it is that god doth command and so be as far from any rule or principle of his actions as he was before and i think very few will take a proposition which amounts to no more than this viz that god is pleased with the doing of what he himself commands for an innate moral principle written on the minds of all men however true and certain it may be since it teaches so little whosoever does so will have reason to think hundreds of propositions innate principles since there are many which have as good a title as this to be received for such which nobody yet ever put into that rank of innate principles scarce possible that god should engrave principles in words of uncertain meaning nor is the fourth proposition vizmen must repent of their sins much more instructive till what those actions are that are meant by sins be set down for the word peccata or sins being put as it usually is to signify in general ill actions that will draw punishment upon the doers what great principle of morality can that be to tell us we should be sorry and cease to do that which will bring mischief upon us without knowing what those particular actions are that will do so indeed this is a very true proposition and fit to be incated on and received by those who are supposed to have been taught what actions in all kinds are sins but neither this nor the former can be imagined to be innate principles nor to be of any use if they were innate unless the particular measures and bounds of all virtues and vices were engraven in mens minds and were innate principles also which i think is very much to be doubted and therefore i imagine it will scarcely seem possible that god should engrave principles in mens minds in words of uncertain signification such as virtues and sins which amongst different men stand for different things nay it cannot be supposed to be in words at all which being in most of these principles very general names cannot be understood but by knowing the particulars comprehended under them and in the practical instances the measures must be taken from the knowledge of the actions themselves and the rules of them abstracted from words and antecedent to the knowledge of names which rules a man must know what language soever he chance to learn whether english or japan or if he should learn no language at all or never should understand the use of words as happens in the case of dumb and deaf men when it shall be made out that men ignorant of words or untaught by the laws and customs of their country know that it is part of the worship of god not to kill another man not to know more women than one not to procure abortion not to expose their children not to take from another what is his though we want it ourselves but on the contrary relieve and supply his wants and whenever we have done the contrary we ought to repent be sorry and resolve to do so no morewhen i say all men shall be proved actually to know and allow all these and a thousand other such rules all of which come under these two general words made use of above viz virtutes et peccata virtues and sins there will be more reason for admitting these and the like for common notions and practical principles yet after all universal consent were there any in moral principles to truths the knowledge whereof may be attained otherwise would scarce prove them to be innate which is all i contend for objection innate principles may be corrupted answered nor will it be of much moment here to offer that very ready but not very material answer viz that the innate principles of morality may by education and custom and the general opinion of those amongst whom we converse be darkened and at last quite worn out of the minds of men which assertion of theirs if true quite takes away the argument of universal consent by which this opinion of innate principles is endeavoured to be proved unless those men will think it reasonable that their private persuasions or that of their party should pass for universal consenta thing not unfrequently done when men presuming themselves to be the only masters of right reason cast by the votes and opinions of the rest of mankind as not worthy the reckoning and then their argument stands thusthe principles which all mankind allow for true are innate those that men of right reason admit are the principles allowed by all mankind we and those of our mind are men of reason therefore we agreeing our principles are innatewhich is a very pretty way of arguing and a short cut to infallibility for otherwise it will be very hard to understand how there be some principles which all men do acknowledge and agree in and yet there are none of those principles which are not by depraved custom and ill education blotted out of the minds of many men which is to say that all men admit but yet many men do deny and dissent from them and indeed the supposition of such first principles will serve us to very little purpose and we shall be as much at a loss with as without them if they may by any human powersuch as the will of our teachers or opinions of our companionsbe altered or lost in us and notwithstanding all this boast of first principles and innate light we shall be as much in the dark and uncertainty as if there were no such thing at all it being all one to have no rule and one that will warp any way or amongst various and contrary rules not to know which is the right but concerning innate principles i desire these men to say whether they can or cannot by education and custom be blurred and blotted out if they cannot we must find them in all mankind alike and they must be clear in everybody and if they may suffer variation from adventitious notions we must then find them clearest and most perspicuous nearest the fountain in children and illiterate people who have received least impression from foreign opinions let them take which side they please they will certainly find it inconsistent with visible matter of fact and daily observation contrary principles in the world i easily grant that there are great numbers of opinions which by men of different countries educations and tempers are received and embraced as first and unquestionable principles many whereof both for their absurdity as well as oppositions to one another it is impossible should be true but yet all those propositions how remote soever from reason are so sacred somewhere or other that men even of good understanding in other matters will sooner part with their lives and whatever is dearest to them than suffer themselves to doubt or others to question the truth of them how men commonly come by their principles this however strange it may seem is that which every days experience confirms and will not perhaps appear so wonderful if we consider the ways and steps by which it is brought about and how really it may come to pass that doctrines that have been derived from no better original than the superstition of a nurse or the authority of an old woman may by length of time and consent of neighbours grow up to the dignity of principles in religion or morality for such who are careful as they call it to principle children well and few there be who have not a set of those principles for them which they believe in instil into the unwary and as yet unprejudiced understanding for white paper receives any characters those doctrines they would have them retain and profess these being taught them as soon as they have any apprehension and still as they grow up confirmed to them either by the open profession or tacit consent of all they have to do with or at least by those of whose wisdom knowledge and piety they have an opinion who never suffer those propositions to be otherwise mentioned but as the basis and foundation on which they build their religion and manners come by these means to have the reputation of unquestionable selfevident and innate truths principles supposed innate because we do not remember when we began to hold them to which we may add that when men so instructed are grown up and reflect on their own minds they cannot find anything more ancient there than those opinions which were taught them before their memory began to keep a register of their actions or date the time when any new thing appeared to them and therefore make no scruple to conclude that those propositions of whose knowledge they can find in themselves no original were certainly the impress of god and nature upon their minds and not taught them by any one else these they entertain and submit to as many do to their parents with veneration not because it is natural nor do children do it where they are not so taught but because having been always so educated and having no remembrance of the beginning of this respect they think it is natural how such principles come to be held this will appear very likely and almost unavoidable to come to pass if we consider the nature of mankind and the constitution of human affairs wherein most men cannot live without employing their time in the daily labours of their callings nor be at quiet in their minds without some foundation or principle to rest their thoughts on there is scarcely any one so floating and superficial in his understanding who hath not some reverenced propositions which are to him the principles on which he bottoms his reasonings and by which he judgeth of truth and falsehood right and wrong which some wanting skill and leisure and others the inclination and some being taught that they ought not to examine there are few to be found who are not exposed by their ignorance laziness education or precipitancy to take them upon trust further explained this is evidently the case of all children and young folk and custom a greater power than nature seldom failing to make them worship for divine what she hath inured them to bow their minds and submit their understandings to it is no wonder that grown men either perplexed in the necessary affairs of life or hot in the pursuit of pleasures should not seriously sit down to examine their own tenets especially when one of their principles is that principles ought not to be questioned and had men leisure parts and will who is there almost that dare shake the foundations of all his past thoughts and actions and endure to bring upon himself the shame of having been a long time wholly in mistake and error who is there hardy enough to contend with the reproach which is everywhere prepared for those who dare venture to dissent from the received opinions of their country or party and where is the man to be found that can patiently prepare himself to bear the name of whimsical sceptical or atheist which he is sure to meet with who does in the least scruple any of the common opinions and he will be much more afraid to question those principles when he shall think them as most men do the standards set up by god in his mind to be the rule and touchstone of all other opinions and what can hinder him from thinking them sacred when he finds them the earliest of all his own thoughts and the most reverenced by others a worship of idols it is easy to imagine how by these means it comes to pass than men worship the idols that have been set up in their minds grow fond of the notions they have been long acquainted with there and stamp the characters of divinity upon absurdities and errors become zealous votaries to bulls and monkeys and contend too fight and die in defence of their opinions dum solos credit habendos esse deos quos ipse colit for since the reasoning faculties of the soul which are almost constantly though not always warily nor wisely employed would not know how to move for want of a foundation and footing in most men who through laziness or avocation do not or for want of time or true helps or for other causes cannot penetrate into the principles of knowledge and trace truth to its fountain and original it is natural for them and almost unavoidable to take up with some borrowed principles which being reputed and presumed to be the evident proofs of other things are thought not to need any other proof themselves whoever shall receive any of these into his mind and entertain them there with the reverence usually paid to principles never venturing to examine them but accustoming himself to believe them because they are to be believed may take up from his education and the fashions of his country any absurdity for innate principles and by long poring on the same objects so dim his sight as to take monsters lodged in his own brain for the images of the deity and the workmanship of his hands principles must be examined by this progress how many there are who arrive at principles which they believe innate may be easily observed in the variety of opposite principles held and contended for by all sorts and degrees of men and he that shall deny this to be the method wherein most men proceed to the assurance they have of the truth and evidence of their principles will perhaps find it a hard matter any other way to account for the contrary tenets which are firmly believed confidently asserted and which great numbers are ready at any time to seal with their blood and indeed if it be the privilege of innate principles to be received upon their own authority without examination i know not what may not be believed or how any ones principles can be questioned if they may and ought to be examined and tried i desire to know how first and innate principles can be tried or at least it is reasonable to demand the marks and characters whereby the genuine innate principles may be distinguished from others that so amidst the great variety of pretenders i may be kept from mistakes in so material a point as this when this is done i shall be ready to embrace such welcome and useful propositions and till then i may with modesty doubt since i fear universal consent which is the only one produced will scarcely prove a sufficient mark to direct my choice and assure me of any innate principles from what has been said i think it past doubt that there are no practical principles wherein all men agree and therefore none innate other considerations concerning innate principles both speculative and practical principles not innate unless their ideas be innate had those who would persuade us that there are innate principles not taken them together in gross but considered separately the parts out of which those propositions are made they would not perhaps have been so forward to believe they were innate since if the ideas which made up those truths were not it was impossible that the propositions made up of them should be innate or our knowledge of them be born with us for if the ideas be not innate there was a time when the mind was without those principles and then they will not be innate but be derived from some other original for where the ideas themselves are not there can be no knowledge no assent no mental or verbal propositions about them ideas especially those belonging to principles not born with children if we will attentively consider newborn children we shall have little reason to think that they bring many ideas into the world with them for bating perhaps some faint ideas of hunger and thirst and warmth and some pains which they may have felt in the womb there is not the least appearance of any settled ideas at all in them especially of ideas answering the terms which make up those universal propositions that are esteemed innate principles one may perceive how by degrees afterwards ideas come into their minds and that they get no more nor other than what experience and the observation of things that come in their way furnish them with which might be enough to satisfy us that they are not original characters stamped on the mind impossibility and identity not innate ideas it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be is certainly if there be any such an innate principle but can any one think or will any one say that impossibility and identity are two innate ideas are they such as all mankind have and bring into the world with them and are they those which are the first in children and antecedent to all acquired ones if they are innate they must needs be so hath a child an idea of impossibility and identity before it has of white or black sweet or bitter and is it from the knowledge of this principle that it concludes that wormwood rubbed on the nipple hath not the same taste that it used to receive from thence is it the actual knowledge of impossible est idem esse et non esse that makes a child distinguish between its mother and a stranger or that makes it fond of the one and flee the other or does the mind regulate itself and its assent by ideas that it never yet had or the understanding draw conclusions from principles which it never yet knew or understood the names impossibility and identity stand for two ideas so far from being innate or born with us that i think it requires great care and attention to form them right in our understandings they are so far from being brought into the world with us so remote from the thoughts of infancy and childhood that i believe upon examination it will be found that many grown men want them identity an idea not innate if identity to instance that alone be a native impression and consequently so clear and obvious to us that we must needs know it even from our cradles i would gladly be resolved by any one of seven or seventy years old whether a man being a creature consisting of soul and body be the same man when his body is changed whether euphorbus and pythagoras having had the same soul were the same men though they lived several ages asunder nay whether the cock too which had the same soul were not the same with both of them whereby perhaps it will appear that our idea of sameness is not so settled and clear as to deserve to be thought innate in us for if those innate ideas are not clear and distinct so as to be universally known and naturally agreed on they cannot be subjects of universal and undoubted truths but will be the unavoidable occasion of perpetual uncertainty for i suppose every ones idea of identity will not be the same that pythagoras and thousands of his followers have and which then shall be true which innate or are there two different ideas of identity both innate what makes the same man nor let any one think that the questions i have here proposed about the identity of man are bare empty speculations which if they were would be enough to show that there was in the understandings of men no innate idea of identity he that shall with a little attention reflect on the resurrection and consider that divine justice will bring to judgment at the last day the very same persons to be happy or miserable in the other who did well or ill in this life will find it perhaps not easy to resolve with himself what makes the same man or wherein identity consists and will not be forward to think he and every one even children themselves have naturally a clear idea of it whole and part not innate ideas let us examine that principle of mathematics viz that the whole is bigger than a part this i take it is reckoned amongst innate principles i am sure it has as good a title as any to be thought so which yet nobody can think it to be when he considers that the ideas it comprehends in it whole and part are perfectly relative but the positive ideas to which they properly and immediately belong are extension and number of which alone whole and part are relations so that if whole and part are innate ideas extension and number must be so too it being impossible to have an idea of a relation without having any at all of the thing to which it belongs and in which it is founded now whether the minds of men have naturally imprinted on them the ideas of extension and number i leave to be considered by these who are the patrons of innate principles idea of worship not innate that god is to be worshipped is without doubt as great a truth as any that can enter into the mind of man and deserves the first place amongst all practical principles but yet it can by no means be thought innate unless the ideas of god and worship are innate that the idea the term worship stands for is not in the understanding of children and a character stamped on the mind in its first original i think will be easily granted by any one that considers how few there be amongst grown men who have a clear and distinct notion of it and i suppose there cannot be anything more ridiculous than to say that children have this practical principle innate that god is to be worshipped and yet that they know not what that worship of god is which is their duty but to pass by this idea of god not innate if any idea can be imagined innate the idea of god may of all others for many reasons be thought so since it is hard to conceive how there should be innate moral principles without an innate idea of a deity without a notion of a lawmaker it is impossible to have a notion of a law and an obligation to observe it besides the atheists taken notice of amongst the ancients and left branded upon the records of history hath not navigation discovered in these later ages whole nations at the bay of soldania in brazil in boranday and in the caribbee islands c amongst whom there was to be found no notion of a god no religion nicholaus del techo in literis ex paraquaria de caiguarum conversione has these words reperi eam gentem nullum nomen habere quod deum et hominis animam significet nulla sacra habet nulla idola these are instances of nations where uncultivated nature has been left to itself without the help of letters and discipline and the improvements of arts and sciences but there are others to be found who have enjoyed these in a very great measure who yet for want of a due application of their thoughts this way want the idea and knowledge of god it will i doubt not be a surprise to others as it was to me to find the siamites of this number but for this let them consult the king of frances late envoy thither who gives no better account of the chinese themselves and if we will not believe la loubere the missionaries of china even the jesuits themselves the great encomiasts of the chinese do all to a man agree and will convince us that the sect of the literari or learned keeping to the old religion of china and the ruling party there are all of them atheists vid navarette in the collection of voyages vol i and historia cultus sinensium and perhaps if we should with attention mind the lives and discourses of people not so far off we should have too much reason to fear that many in more civilized countries have no very strong and clear impressions of a deity upon their minds and that the complaints of atheism made from the pulpit are not without reason and though only some profligate wretches own it too barefacedly now yet perhaps we should hear more than we do of it from others did not the fear of the magistrates sword or their neighbours censure tie up peoples tongues which were the apprehensions of punishment or shame taken away would as openly proclaim their atheism as their lives do the name of god not universal or obscure in meaning but had all mankind everywhere a notion of a god whereof yet history tells us the contrary it would not from thence follow that the idea of him was innate for though no nation were to be found without a name and some few dark notions of him yet that would not prove them to be natural impressions on the mind no more than the names of fire or the sun heat or number do prove the ideas they stand for to be innate because the names of those things and the ideas of them are so universally received and known amongst mankind nor on the contrary is the want of such a name or the absence of such a notion out of mens minds any argument against the being of a god any more than it would be a proof that there was no loadstone in the world because a great part of mankind had neither a notion of any such thing nor a name for it or be any show of argument to prove that there are no distinct and various species of angels or intelligent beings above us because we have no ideas of such distinct species or names for them for men being furnished with words by the common language of their own countries can scarce avoid having some kind of ideas of those things whose names those they converse with have occasion frequently to mention to them and if they carry with it the notion of excellency greatness or something extraordinary if apprehension and concernment accompany it if the fear of absolute and irresistible power set it on upon the mindthe idea is likely to sink the deeper and spread the further especially if it be such an idea as is agreeable to the common light of reason and naturally deducible from every part of our knowledge as that of a god is for the visible marks of extraordinary wisdom and power appear so plainly in all the works of the creation that a rational creature who will but seriously reflect on them cannot miss the discovery of a deity and the influence that the discovery of such a being must necessarily have on the minds of all that have but once heard of it is so great and carries such a weight of thought and communication with it that it seems stranger to me that a whole nation of men should be anywhere found so brutish as to want the notion of a god than that they should be without any notion of numbers or fire ideas of god and idea of fire the name of god being once mentioned in any part of the world to express a superior powerful wise invisible being the suitableness of such a notion to the principles of common reason and the interest men will always have to mention it often must necessarily spread it far and wide and continue it down to all generations though yet the general reception of this name and some imperfect and unsteady notions conveyed thereby to the unthinking part of mankind prove not the idea to be innate but only that they who made the discovery had made a right use of their reason thought maturely of the causes of things and traced them to their original from whom other less considering people having once received so important a notion it could not easily be lost again idea of god not innate this is all could be inferred from the notion of a god were it to be found universally in all the tribes of mankind and generally acknowledged by men grown to maturity in all countries for the generality of the acknowledging of a god as i imagine is extended no further than that which if it be sufficient to prove the idea of god innate will as well prove the idea of fire innate since i think it may be truly said that there is not a person in the world who has a notion of a god who has not also the idea of fire i doubt not but if a colony of young children should be placed in an island where no fire was they would certainly neither have any notion of such a thing nor name for it how generally soever it were received and known in all the world besides and perhaps too their apprehensions would be as far removed from any name or notion of a god till some one amongst them had employed his thoughts to inquire into the constitution and causes of things which would easily lead him to the notion of a god which having once taught to others reason and the natural propensity of their own thoughts would afterwards propagate and continue amongst them suitable to gods goodness that all men should have an idea of him therefore naturally imprinted by him answered indeed it is urged that it is suitable to the goodness of god to imprint upon the minds of men characters and notions of himself and not to leave them in the dark and doubt in so grand a concernment and also by that means to secure to himself the homage and veneration due from so intelligent a creature as man and therefore he has done it this argument if it be of any force will prove much more than those who use it in this case expect from it for if we may conclude that god hath done for men all that men shall judge is best for them because it is suitable to his goodness so to do it will prove not only that god has imprinted on the minds of men an idea of himself but that he hath plainly stamped there in fair characters all that men ought to know or believe of him all that they ought to do in obedience to his will and that he hath given them a will and affections conformable to it this no doubt every one will think better for men than that they should in the dark grope after knowledge as st paul tells us all nations did after god acts than that their wills should clash with their understandings and their appetites cross their duty the romanists say it is best for men and so suitable to the goodness of god that there should be an infallible judge of controversies on earth and therefore there is one and i by the same reason say it is better for men that every man himself should be infallible i leave them to consider whether by the force of this argument they shall think that every man is so i think it a very good argument to saythe infinitely wise god hath made it so and therefore it is best but it seems to me a little too much confidence of our own wisdom to sayi think it best and therefore god hath made it so and in the matter in hand it will be in vain to argue from such a topic that god hath done so when certain experience shows us that he hath not but the goodness of god hath not been wanting to men without such original impressions of knowledge or ideas stamped on the mind since he hath furnished man with those faculties which will serve for the sufficient discovery of all things requisite to the end of such a being and i doubt not but to show that a man by the right use of his natural abilities may without any innate principles attain a knowledge of a god and other things that concern him god having endued man with those faculties of knowledge which he hath was no more obliged by his goodness to plant those innate notions in his mind than that having given him reason hands and materials he should build him bridges or houseswhich some people in the world however of good parts do either totally want or are but ill provided of as well as others are wholly without ideas of god and principles of morality or at least have but very ill ones the reason in both cases being that they never employed their parts faculties and powers industriously that way but contented themselves with the opinions fashions and things of their country as they found them without looking any further had you or i been born at the bay of soldania possibly our thoughts and notions had not exceeded those brutish ones of the hottentots that inhabit there and had the virginia king apochancana been educated in england he had been perhaps as knowing a divine and as good a mathematician as any in it the difference between him and a more improved englishman lying barely in this that the exercise of his faculties was bounded within the ways modes and notions of his own country and never directed to any other or further inquiries and if he had not any idea of a god it was only because he pursued not those thoughts that would have led him to it ideas of god various in different men i grant that if there were any ideas to be found imprinted on the minds of men we have reason to expect it should be the notion of his maker as a mark god set on his own workmanship to mind man of his dependence and duty and that herein should appear the first instances of human knowledge but how late is it before any such notion is discoverable in children and when we find it there how much more does it resemble the opinion and notion of the teacher than represent the true god he that shall observe in children the progress whereby their minds attain the knowledge they have will think that the objects they do first and most familiarly converse with are those that make the first impressions on their understandings nor will he find the least footsteps of any other it is easy to take notice how their thoughts enlarge themselves only as they come to be acquainted with a greater variety of sensible objects to retain the ideas of them in their memories and to get the skill to compound and enlarge them and several ways put them together how by these means they come to frame in their minds an idea men have of a deity i shall hereafter show contrary and inconsistent ideas of god under the same name can it be thought that the ideas men have of god are the characters and marks of himself engraven in their minds by his own finger when we see that in the same country under one and the same name men have far different nay often contrary and inconsistent ideas and conceptions of him their agreeing in a name or sound will scarce prove an innate notion of him gross ideas of god what true or tolerable notion of a deity could they have who acknowledged and worshipped hundreds every deity that they owned above one was an infallible evidence of their ignorance of him and a proof that they had no true notion of god where unity infinity and eternity were excluded to which if we add their gross conceptions of corporeity expressed in their images and representations of their deities the amours marriages copulations lusts quarrels and other mean qualities attributed by them to their gods we shall have little reason to think that the heathen world ie the greatest part of mankind had such ideas of god in their minds as he himself out of care that they should not be mistaken about him was author of and this universality of consent so much argued if it prove any native impressions it will be only thisthat god imprinted on the minds of all men speaking the same language a name for himself but not any idea since those people who agreed in the name had at the same time far different apprehensions about the thing signified if they say that the variety of deities worshipped by the heathen world were but figurative ways of expressing the several attributes of that incomprehensible being or several parts of his providence i answer what they might be in the original i will not here inquire but that they were so in the thoughts of the vulgar i think nobody will affirm and he that will consult the voyage of the bishop of beryte c not to mention other testimonies will find that the theology of the siamites professedly owns a plurality of gods or as the abbe de choisy more judiciously remarks in his journal du voyage de siam it consists properly in acknowledging no god at all idea of god not innate although wise men of all nations come to have it if it be said that wise men of all nations came to have true conceptions of the unity and infinity of the deity i grant it but then this first excludes universality of consent in anything but the name for those wise men being very few perhaps one of a thousand this universality is very narrow secondly it seems to me plainly to prove that the truest and best notions men have of god were not imprinted but acquired by thought and meditation and a right use of their faculties since the wise and considerate men of the world by a right and careful employment of their thoughts and reason attained true notions in this as well as other things whilst the lazy and inconsiderate part of men making far the greater number took up their notions by chance from common tradition and vulgar conceptions without much beating their heads about them and if it be a reason to think the notion of god innate because all wise men had it virtue too must be thought innate for that also wise men have always had odd low and pitiful ideas of god common among men this was evidently the case of all gentilism nor hath even amongst jews christians and mahometans who acknowledged but one god this doctrine and the care taken in those nations to teach men to have true notions of a god prevailed so far as to make men to have the same and the true ideas of him how many even amongst us will be found upon inquiry to fancy him in the shape of a man sitting in heaven and to have many other absurd and unfit conceptions of him christians as well as turks have had whole sects owning and contending earnestly for itthat the deity was corporeal and of human shape and though we find few now amongst us who profess themselves anthropomorphites though some i have met with that own it yet i believe he that will make it his business may find amongst the ignorant and uninstructed christians many of that opinion talk but with country people almost of any age or young people almost of any condition and you shall find that though the name of god be frequently in their mouths yet the notions they apply this name to are so odd low and pitiful that nobody can imagine they were taught by a rational man much less that they were characters written by the finger of god himself nor do i see how it derogates more from the goodness of god that he has given us minds unfurnished with these ideas of himself than that he hath sent us into the world with bodies unclothed and that there is no art or skill born with us for being fitted with faculties to attain these it is want of industry and consideration in us and not of bounty in him if we have them not it is as certain that there is a god as that the opposite angles made by the intersection of two straight lines are equal there was never any rational creature that set himself sincerely to examine the truth of these propositions that could fail to assent to them though yet it be past doubt that there are many men who having not applied their thoughts that way are ignorant both of the one and the other if any one think fit to call this which is the utmost of its extent universal consent such an one i easily allow but such an universal consent as this proves not the idea of god any more than it does the idea of such angles innate if the idea of god be not innate no other can be supposed innate since then though the knowledge of a god be the most natural discovery of human reason yet the idea of him is not innate as i think is evident from what has been said i imagine there will be scarce any other idea found that can pretend to it since if god hath set any impression any character on the understanding of men it is most reasonable to expect it should have been some clear and uniform idea of himself as far as our weak capacities were capable to receive so incomprehensible and infinite an object but our minds being at first void of that idea which we are most concerned to have it is a strong presumption against all other innate characters i must own as far as i can observe i can find none and would be glad to be informed by any other idea of substance not innate i confess there is another idea which would be of general use for mankind to have as it is of general talk as if they had it and that is the idea of substance which we neither have nor can have by sensation or reflection if nature took care to provide us any ideas we might well expect they should be such as by our own faculties we cannot procure to ourselves but we see on the contrary that since by those ways whereby other ideas are brought into our minds this is not we have no such clear idea at all and therefore signify nothing by the word substance but only an uncertain supposition of we know not what ie of something whereof we have no particular distinct positive idea which we take to be the substratum or support of those ideas we do know no propositions can be innate since no ideas are innate whatever then we talk of innate either speculative or practical principles it may with as much probability be said that a man hath sterling in his pocket and yet denied that he hath there either penny shilling crown or other coin out of which the sum is to be made up as to think that certain propositions are innate when the ideas about which they are can by no means be supposed to be so the general reception and assent that is given doth not at all prove that the ideas expressed in them are innate for in many cases however the ideas came there the assent to words expressing the agreement or disagreement of such ideas will necessarily follow every one that hath a true idea of god and worship will assent to this proposition that god is to be worshipped when expressed in a language he understands and every rational man that hath not thought on it today may be ready to assent to this proposition tomorrow and yet millions of men may be well supposed to want one or both those ideas today for if we will allow savages and most country people to have ideas of god and worship which conversation with them will not make one forward to believe yet i think few children can be supposed to have those ideas which therefore they must begin to have some time or other and then they will also begin to assent to that proposition and make very little question of it ever after but such an assent upon hearing no more proves the ideas to be innate than it does that one born blind with cataracts which will be couched tomorrow had the innate ideas of the sun or light or saffron or yellow because when his sight is cleared he will certainly assent to this proposition that the sun is lucid or that saffron is yellow and therefore if such an assent upon hearing cannot prove the ideas innate it can much less the propositions made up of those ideas if they have any innate ideas i would be glad to be told what and how many they are no innate ideas in the memory to which let me add if there be any innate ideas any ideas in the mind which the mind does not actually think on they must be lodged in the memory and from thence must be brought into view by remembrance ie must be known when they are remembered to have been perceptions in the mind before unless remembrance can be without remembrance for to remember is to perceive anything with memory or with a consciousness that it was perceived or known before without this whatever idea comes into the mind is new and not remembered this consciousness of its having been in the mind before being that which distinguishes remembering from all other ways of thinking whatever idea was never perceived by the mind was never in the mind whatever idea is in the mind is either an actual perception or else having been an actual perception is so in the mind that by the memory it can be made an actual perception again whenever there is the actual perception of any idea without memory the idea appears perfectly new and unknown before to the understanding when ever the memory brings any idea into actual view it is with a consciousness that it had been there before and was not wholly a stranger to the mind whether this be not so i appeal to every ones observation and then i desire an instance of an idea pretended to be innate which before any impression of it by ways hereafter to be mentioned any one could revive and remember as an idea he had formerly known without which consciousness of a former perception there is no remembrance and whatever idea comes into the mind without that consciousness is not remembered or comes not out of the memory nor can be said to be in the mind before that appearance for what is not either actually in view or in the memory is in the mind no way at all and is all one as if it had never been there suppose a child had the use of his eyes till he knows and distinguishes colours but then cataracts shut the windows and he is forty or fifty years perfectly in the dark and in that time perfectly loses all memory of the ideas of colours he once had this was the case of a blind man i once talked with who lost his sight by the smallpox when he was a child and had no more notion of colours than one born blind i ask whether any one can say this man had then any ideas of colours in his mind any more than one born blind and i think nobody will say that either of them had in his mind any ideas of colours at all his cataracts are couched and then he has the ideas which he remembers not of colours de novo by his restored sight conveyed to his mind and that without any consciousness of a former acquaintance and these now he can revive and call to mind in the dark in this case all these ideas of colours which when out of view can be revived with a consciousness of a former acquaintance being thus in the memory are said to be in the mind the use i make of this isthat whatever idea being not actually in view is in the mind is there only by being in the memory and if it be not in the memory it is not in the mind and if it be in the memory it cannot by the memory be brought into actual view without a perception that it comes out of the memory which is this that it had been known before and is now remembered if therefore there be any innate ideas they must be in the memory or else nowhere in the mind and if they be in the memory they can be revived without any impression from without and whenever they are brought into the mind they are remembered ie they bring with them a perception of their not being wholly new to it this being a constant and distinguishing difference between what is and what is not in the memory or in the mindthat what is not in the memory whenever it appears there appears perfectly new and unknown before and what is in the memory or in the mind whenever it is suggested by the memory appears not to be new but the mind finds it in itself and knows it was there before by this it may be tried whether there be any innate ideas in the mind before impression from sensation or reflection i would fain meet with the man who when he came to the use of reason or at any other time remembered any of them and to whom after he was born they were never new if any one will say there are ideas in the mind that are not in the memory i desire him to explain himself and make what he says intelligible principles not innate because of little use or little certainty besides what i have already said there is another reason why i doubt that neither these nor any other principles are innate i that am fully persuaded that the infinitely wise god made all things in perfect wisdom cannot satisfy myself why he should be supposed to print upon the minds of men some universal principles whereof those that are pretended innate and concern speculation are of no great use and those that concern practice not selfevident and neither of them distinguishable from some other truths not allowed to be innate for to what purpose should characters be graven on the mind by the finger of god which are not clearer there than those which are afterwards introduced or cannot be distinguished from them if any one thinks there are such innate ideas and propositions which by their clearness and usefulness are distinguishable from all that is adventitious in the mind and acquired it will not be a hard matter for him to tell us which they are and then every one will be a fit judge whether they be so or no since if there be such innate ideas and impressions plainly different from all other perceptions and knowledge every one will find it true in himself of the evidence of these supposed innate maxims i have spoken already of their usefulness i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter difference of mens discoveries depends upon the different application of their faculties to conclude some ideas forwardly offer themselves to all mens understanding and some sorts of truths result from any ideas as soon as the mind puts them into propositions other truths require a train of ideas placed in order a due comparing of them and deductions made with attention before they can be discovered and assented to some of the first sort because of their general and easy reception have been mistaken for innate but the truth is ideas and notions are no more born with us than arts and sciences though some of them indeed offer themselves to our faculties more readily than others and therefore are more generally received though that too be according as the organs of our bodies and powers of our minds happen to be employed god having fitted men with faculties and means to discover receive and retain truths according as they are employed the great difference that is to be found in the notions of mankind is from the different use they put their faculties to whilst some and those the most taking things upon trust misemploy their power of assent by lazily enslaving their minds to the dictates and dominion of others in doctrines which it is their duty carefully to examine and not blindly with an implicit faith to swallow others employing their thoughts only about some few things grow acquainted sufficiently with them attain great degrees of knowledge in them and are ignorant of all other having never let their thoughts loose in the search of other inquiries thus that the three angles of a triangle are quite equal to two right ones is a truth as certain as anything can be and i think more evident than many of those propositions that go for principles and yet there are millions however expert in other things who know not this at all because they never set their thoughts on work about such angles and he that certainly knows this proposition may yet be utterly igno rant of the truth of other propositions in mathematics itself which are as clear and evident as this because in his search of those mathematical truths he stopped his thoughts short and went not so far the same may happen concerning the notions we have of the being of a deity for though there be no truth which a man may more evidently make out to himself than the existence of a god yet he that shall content himself with things as he finds them in this world as they minister to his pleasures and passions and not make inquiry a little further into their causes ends and admirable contrivances and pursue the thoughts thereof with diligence and attention may live long without any notion of such a being and if any person hath by talk put such a notion into his head he may perhaps believe it but if he hath never examined it his knowledge of it will be no perfecter than his who having been told that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones takes it upon trust without examining the demonstration and may yield his assent as a probable opinion but hath no knowledge of the truth of it which yet his faculties if carefully employed were able to make clear and evident to him but this only by the by to show how much our knowledge depends upon the right use of those powers nature hath bestowed upon us and how little upon such innate principles as are in vain supposed to be in all mankind for their direction which all men could not but know if they were there or else they would be there to no purpose and which since all men do not know nor can distinguish from other adventitious truths we may well conclude there are no such men must think and know for themselves what censure doubting thus of innate principles may deserve from men who will be apt to call it pulling up the old foundations of knowledge and certainty i cannot tell i persuade myself at least that the way i have pursued being conformable to truth lays those foundations surer this i am certain i have not made it my business either to quit or follow any authority in the ensuing discourse truth has been my only aim and wherever that has appeared to lead my thoughts have impartially followed without minding whether the footsteps of any other lay that way or not not that i want a due respect to other mens opinions but after all the greatest reverence is due to truth and i hope it will not be thought arrogance to say that perhaps we should make greater progress in the discovery of rational and contemplative knowledge if we sought it in the fountain in the consideration of things themselves and made use rather of our own thoughts than other mens to find it for i think we may as rationally hope to see with other mens eyes as to know by other mens understandings so much as we ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason so much we possess of real and true knowledge the floating of other mens opinions in our brains makes us not one jot the more knowing though they happen to be true what in them was science is in us but opiniatrety whilst we give up our assent only to reverend names and do not as they did employ our own reason to understand those truths which gave them reputation aristotle was certainly a knowing man but nobody ever thought him so because he blindly embraced and confidently vented the opinions of another and if the taking up of anothers principles without examining them made not him a philosopher i suppose it will hardly make anybody else so in the sciences every one has so much as he really knows and comprehends what he believes only and takes upon trust are but shreds which however well in the whole piece make no considerable addition to his stock who gathers them such borrowed wealth like fairy money though it were gold in the hand from which he received it will be but leaves and dust when it comes to use whence the opinion of innate principles when men have found some general propositions that could not be doubted of as soon as understood it was i know a short and easy way to conclude them innate this being once received it eased the lazy from the pains of search and stopped the inquiry of the doubtful concerning all that was once styled innate and it was of no small advantage to those who affected to be masters and teachers to make this the principle of principlesthat principles must not he questioned for having once established this tenetthat there are innate principles it put their followers upon a necessity of receiving some doctrines as such which was to take them off from the use of their own reason and judgment and put them on believing and taking them upon trust without further examination in which posture of blind credulity they might be more easily governed by and made useful to some sort of men who had the skill and office to principle and guide them nor is it a small power it gives one man over another to have the authority to be the dictator of principles and teacher of unquestionable truths and to make a man swallow that for an innate principle which may serve to his purpose who teacheth them whereas had they examined the ways whereby men came to the knowledge of many universal truths they would have found them to result in the minds of men from the being of things themselves when duly considered and that they were discovered by the application of those faculties that were fitted by nature to receive and judge of them when duly employed about them conclusion to show how the understanding proceeds herein is the design of the following discourse which i shall proceed to when i have first premised that hithertoto clear my way to those foundations which i conceive are the only true ones whereon to establish those notions we can have of our own knowledgeit hath been necessary for me to give an account of the reasons i had to doubt of innate principles and since the arguments which are against them do some of them rise from common received opinions i have been forced to take several things for granted which is hardly avoidable to any one whose task is to show the falsehood or improbability of any tenetit happening in controversial discourses as it does in assaulting of towns where if the ground be but firm whereon the batteries are erected there is no further inquiry of whom it is borrowed nor whom it belongs to so it affords but a fit rise for the present purpose but in the future part of this discourse designing to raise an edifice uniform and consistent with itself as far as my own experience and observation will assist me i hope to erect it on such a basis that i shall not need to shore it up with props and buttresses leaning on borrowed or begged foundations or at least if mine prove a castle in the air i will endeavour it shall be all of a piece and hang together wherein i warn the reader not to expect undeniable cogent demonstrations unless i may be allowed the privilege not seldom assumed by others to take my principles for granted and then i doubt not but i can demonstrate too all that i shall say for the principles i proceed on is that i can only appeal to mens own unprejudiced experience and observation whether they be true or not and this is enough for a man who professes no more than to lay down candidly and freely his own conjectures concerning a subject lying somewhat in the dark without any other design than an unbiased inquiry after truth of ideas of ideas in general and their original idea is the object of thinking every man being conscious to himself that he thinks and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the ideas that are there it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideassuch as are those expressed by the words whiteness hardness sweetness thinking motion man elephant army drunkenness and others it is in the first place then to be inquired how he comes by them i know it is a received doctrine that men have native ideas and original characters stamped upon their minds in their very first being this opinion i have at large examined already and i suppose what i have said in the foregoing book will be much more easily admitted when i have shown whence the understanding may get all the ideas it has and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mindfor which i shall appeal to every ones own observation and experience all ideas come from sensation or reflection let us then suppose the mind to be as we say white paper void of all characters without any ideashow comes it to be furnished whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge to this i answer in one word from experience in that all our knowledge is founded and from that it ultimately derives itself our observation employed either about external sensible objects or about the in ternal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves is that which supplies our understandings with all the materials of thinking these two are the fountains of knowledge from whence all the ideas we have or can naturally have do spring the objects of sensation one source of ideas first our senses conversant about particular sensible objects do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things according to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them and thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow white heat cold soft hard bitter sweet and all those which we call sensible qualities which when i say the senses convey into the mind i mean they from external objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions this great source of most of the ideas we have depending wholly upon our senses and derived by them to the understanding i call sensation the operations of our minds the other source of them secondly the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas isthe perception of the operations of our own mind within us as it is employed about the ideas it has gotwhich operations when the soul comes to reflect on and consider do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas which could not be had from things without and such are perception thinking doubting believing reasoning knowing willing and all the different actings of our own mindswhich we being conscious of and observing in ourselves do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses this source of ideas every man has wholly in himself and though it be not sense as having nothing to do with external objects yet it is very like it and might properly enough be called internal sense but as i call the other sensation so i call this reflection the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself by reflection then in the following part of this discourse i would be understood to mean that notice which the mind takes of its own operations and the manner of them by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding these two i say viz external material things as the objects of sensation and the operations of our own minds within as the objects of reflection are to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings the term operations here i use in a large sense as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought all our ideas are of the one or the other of these the understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of any ideas which it doth not receive from one of these two external objects furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities which are all those different perceptions they produce in us and the mind furnishes the understanding with ideas of its own operations these when we have taken a full survey of them and their several modes combinations and relations we shall find to contain all our whole stock of ideas and that we have nothing in our minds which did not come in one of these two ways let any one examine his own thoughts and thoroughly search into his understanding and then let him tell me whether all the original ideas he has there are any other than of the objects of his senses or of the operations of his mind considered as objects of his reflection and how great a mass of knowledge soever he imagines to be lodged there he will upon taking a strict view see that he has not any idea in his mind but what one of these two have imprintedthough perhaps with infinite variety compounded and enlarged by the understanding as we shall see hereafter observable in children he that attentively considers the state of a child at his first coming into the world will have little reason to think him stored with plenty of ideas that are to be the matter of his future knowledge it is by degrees he comes to be furnished with them and though the ideas of obvious and familiar qualities imprint themselves before the memory begins to keep a register of time or order yet it is often so late before some unusual qualities come in the way that there are few men that cannot recollect the beginning of their acquaintance with them and if it were worth while no doubt a child might be so ordered as to have but a very few even of the ordinary ideas till he were grown up to a man but all that are born into the world being surrounded with bodies that perpetually and diversely affect them variety of ideas whether care be taken of it or not are imprinted on the minds of children light and colours are busy at hand everywhere when the eye is but open sounds and some tangible qualities fail not to solicit their proper senses and force an entrance to the mindbut yet i think it will be granted easily that if a child were kept in a place where he never saw any other but black and white till he were a man he would have no more ideas of scarlet or green than he that from his childhood never tasted an oyster or a pineapple has of those particular relishes men are differently furnished with these according to the different objects they converse with men then come to be furnished with fewer or more simple ideas from without according as the objects they converse with afford greater or less variety and from the operations of their minds within according as they more or less reflect on them for though he that contemplates the operations of his mind cannot but have plain and clear ideas of them yet unless he turn his thoughts that way and considers them attentively he will no more have clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind and all that may be observed therein than he will have all the particular ideas of any landscape or of the parts and motions of a clock who will not turn his eyes to it and with attention heed all the parts of it the picture or clock may be so placed that they may come in his way every day but yet he will have but a confused idea of all the parts they are made up of till he applies himself with attention to consider them each in particular ideas of reflection later because they need attention and hence we see the reason why it is pretty late before most children get ideas of the operations of their own minds and some have not any very clear or perfect ideas of the greatest part of them all their lives because though they pass there continually yet like floating visions they make not deep impressions enough to leave in their mind clear distinct lasting ideas till the understanding turns inward upon itself reflects on its own operations and makes them the objects of its own contemplation children when they come first into it are surrounded with a world of new things which by a constant solicitation of their senses draw the mind constantly to them forward to take notice of new and apt to be delighted with the variety of changing objects thus the first years are usually employed and diverted in looking abroad mens business in them is to acquaint themselves with what is to be found without and so growing up in a constant attention to outward sensations seldom make any considerable reflection on what passes within them till they come to be of riper years and some scarce ever at all the soul begins to have ideas when it begins to perceive to ask at what time a man has first any ideas is to ask when he begins to perceivehaving ideas and perception being the same thing i know it is an opinion that the soul always thinks and that it has the actual perception of ideas in itself constantly as long as it exists and that actual thinking is as inseparable from the soul as actual extension is from the body which if true to inquire after the beginning of a mans ideas is the same as to inquire after the beginning of his soul for by this account soul and its ideas as body and its extension will begin to exist both at the same time the soul thinks not always for this wants proofs but whether the soul be supposed to exist antecedent to or coeval with or some time after the first rudiments of organization or the beginnings of life in the body i leave to be disputed by those who have better thought of that matter i confess myself to have one of those dull souls that doth not perceive itself always to contemplate ideas nor can conceive it any more necessary for the soul always to think than for the body always to move the perception of ideas being as i conceive to the soul what motion is to the body not its essence but one of its operations and therefore though thinking be supposed never so much the proper action of the soul yet it is not necessary to suppose that it should be always thinking always in action that perhaps is the privilege of the infinite author and preserver of all things who never slumbers nor sleeps but is not competent to any finite being at least not to the soul of man we know certainly by experience that we sometimes think and thence draw this infallible consequencethat there is something in us that has a power to think but whether that substance perpetually thinks or no we can be no further assured than experience informs us for to say that actual thinking is essential to the soul and inseparable from it is to beg what is in question and not to prove it by reason which is necessary to be done if it be not a selfevident proposition but whether this that the soul always thinks be a selfevident proposition that everybody assents to at first hearing i appeal to mankind it is doubted whether i thought at all last night or no the question being about a matter of fact it is begging it to bring as a proof for it an hypothesis which is the very thing in dispute by which way one may prove anything and it is but supposing that all watches whilst the balance beats think and it is sufficiently proved and past doubt that my watch thought all last night but he that would not deceive himself ought to build his hypothesis on matter of fact and make it out by sensible experience and not presume on matter of fact because of his hypothesis that is because he supposes it to be so which way of proving amounts to this that i must necessarily think all last night because another supposes i always think though i myself cannot perceive that i always do so but men in love with their opinions may not only suppose what is in question but allege wrong matter of fact how else could any one make it an inference of mine that a thing is not because we are not sensible of it in our sleep i do not say there is no soul in a man because he is not sensible of it in his sleep but i do say he cannot think at any time waking or sleeping without being sensible of it our being sensible of it is not necessary to anything but to our thoughts and to them it is and to them it always will be necessary till we can think without being conscious of it it is not always conscious of it i grant that the soul in a waking man is never without thought because it is the condition of being awake but whether sleeping without dreaming be not an affection of the whole man mind as well as body may be worth a waking mans consideration it being hard to conceive that anything should think and not be conscious of it if the soul doth think in a sleeping man without being conscious of it i ask whether during such thinking it has any pleasure or pain or be capable of happiness or misery i am sure the man is not no more than the bed or earth he lies on for to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible or if it be possible that the soul can whilst the body is sleeping have its thinking enjoyments and concerns its pleasures or pain apart which the man is not conscious of nor partakes init is certain that socrates asleep and socrates awake is not the same person but his soul when he sleeps and socrates the man consisting of body and soul when he is waking are two persons since waking socrates has no knowledge of or concernment for that happiness or misery of his soul which it enjoys alone by itself whilst he sleeps without perceiving anything of it no more than he has for the happiness or misery of a man in the indies whom he knows not for if we take wholly away all consciousness of our actions and sensations especially of pleasure and pain and the concernment that accompanies it it will be hard to know wherein to place personal identity if a sleeping man thinks without knowing it the sleeping and waking man are two persons the soul during sound sleep thinks say these men whilst it thinks and perceives it is capable certainly of those of delight or trouble as well as any other perceptions and it must necessarily be conscious of its own perceptions but it has all this apart the sleeping man it is plain is conscious of nothing of all this let us suppose then the soul of castor while he is sleeping retired from his body which is no impossible supposition for the men i have here to do with who so liberally allow life without a thinking soul to all other animals these men cannot then judge it impossible or a contradiction that the body should live without the soul nor that the soul should subsist and think or have perception even perception of happiness or misery without the body let us then i say suppose the soul of castor separated during his sleep from his body to think apart let us suppose too that it chooses for its scene of thinking the body of another man vg pollux who is sleeping without a soul for if castors soul can think whilst castor is asleep what castor is never conscious of it is no matter what place it chooses to think in we have here then the bodies of two men with only one soul between them which we will suppose to sleep and wake by turns and the soul still thinking in the waking man whereof the sleeping man is never conscious has never the least perception i ask then whether castor and pollux thus with only one soul between them which thinks and perceives in one what the other is never conscious of nor is concerned for are not two as distinct persons as castor and hercules or as socrates and plato were and whether one of them might not be very happy and the other very miserable just by the same reason they make the soul and the man two persons who make the soul think apart what the man is not conscious of for i suppose nobody will make identity of persons to consist in the souls being united to the very same numercial particles of matter for if that be necessary to identity it will be impossible in that constant flux of the particles of our bodies that any man should be the same person two days or two moments together impossible to convince those that sleep without dreaming that they think thus methinks every drowsy nod shakes their doctrine who teach that the soul is always thinking those at least who do at any time sleep without dreaming can never be convinced that their thoughts are sometimes for four hours busy without their knowing of it and if they are taken in the very act waked in the middle of that sleeping contemplation can give no manner of account of it that men dream without remembering it in vain urged it will perhaps be saidthat the soul thinks even in the soundest sleep but the memory retains it not that the soul in a sleeping man should be this moment busy a thinking and the next moment in a waking man not remember nor be able to recollect one jot of all those thoughts is very hard to be conceived and would need some better proof than bare assertion to make it be believed for who can without any more ado but being barely told so imagine that the greatest part of men do during all their lives for several hours every day think of something which if they were asked even in the middle of these thoughts they could remember nothing at all of most men i think pass a great part of their sleep without dreaming i once knew a man that was bred a scholar and had no bad memory who told me he had never dreamed in his life till he had that fever he was then newly recovered of which was about the five or six and twentieth year of his age i suppose the world affords more such instances at least every ones acquaintance will furnish him with examples enough of such as pass most of their nights without dreaming upon this hypothesis the thoughts of a sleeping man ought to be most rational to think often and never to retain it so much as one moment is a very useless sort of thinking and the soul in such a state of thinking does very little if at all excel that of a lookingglass which constantly receives variety of images or ideas but retains none they disappear and vanish and there remain no footsteps of them the looking glass is never the better for such ideas nor the soul for such thoughts perhaps it will be said that in a waking man the materials of the body are employed and made use of in thinking and that the memory of thoughts is retained by the impressions that are made on the brain and the traces there left after such thinking but that in the thinking of the soul which is not perceived in a sleeping man there the soul thinks apart and making no use of the organs of the body leaves no impressions on it and consequently no memory of such thoughts not to mention again the absurdity of two distinct persons which follows from this supposition i answer further that whatever ideas the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the body it is reasonable to conclude it can retain without the help of the body too or else the soul or any separate spirit will have but little advantage by thinking if it has no memory of its own thoughts if it cannot lay them up for its own use and be able to recall them upon occasion if it cannot reflect upon what is past and make use of its former experiences reasonings and contemplations to what purpose does it think they who make the soul a thinking thing at this rate will not make it a much more noble being than those do whom they condemn for allowing it to be nothing but the subtilist parts of matter characters drawn on dust that the first breath of wind effaces or impressions made on a heap of atoms or animal spirits are altogether as useful and render the subject as noble as the thoughts of a soul that perish in thinking that once out of sight are gone forever and leave no memory of themselves behind them nature never makes excellent things for mean or no uses and it is hardly to be conceived that our infinitely wise creator should make so admirable a faculty which comes nearest the excellency of his own incomprehensible being to be so idly and uselessly employed at least a fourth part of its time here as to think constantly without remembering any of those thoughts without doing any good to itself or others or being any way useful to any other part of the creation if we will examine it we shall not find i suppose the motion of dull and senseless matter any where in the universe made so little use of and so wholly thrown away on this hypothesis the soul must have ideas not derived from sensation or reflection of which there is no appearance it is true we have sometimes instances of perception whilst we are asleep and retain the memory of those thoughts but how extravagant and incoherent for the most part they are how little conformable to the perfection and order of a rational being those who are acquainted with dreams need not be told this i would willingly be satisfied inwhether the soul when it thinks thus apart and as it were separate from the body acts less rationally than when conjointly with it or no if its separate thoughts be less rational then these men must say that the soul owes the perfection of rational thinking to the body if it does not it is a wonder that our dreams should be for the most part so frivolous and irrational and that the soul should retain none of its more rational soliloquies and meditations if i think when i know it not nobody else can know it those who so confidently tell us that the soul always actually thinks i would they would also tell us what those ideas are that are in the soul of a child before or just at the union with the body before it hath received any by sensation the dreams of sleeping men are as i take it all made up of the waking mans ideas though for the most part oddly put together it is strange if the soul has ideas of its own that it derived not from sensation or reflection as it must have if it thought before it received any impressions from the body that it should never in its private thinking so private that the man himself perceives it not retain any of them the very moment it wakes out of them and then make the man glad with new discoveries who can find it reason that the soul should in its retirement during sleep have so many hours thoughts and yet never light on any of those ideas it borrowed not from sensation or reflection or at least preserve the memory of none but such which being occasioned from the body must needs be less natural to a spirit it is strange the soul should never once in a mans whole life recall over any of its pure native thoughts and those ideas it had before it borrowed anything from the body never bring into the waking mans view any other ideas but what have a tang of the cask and manifestly derive their original from that union if it always thinks and so had ideas before it was united or before it received any from the body it is not to be supposed but that during sleep it recollects its native ideas and during that retirement from communicating with the body whilst it thinks by itself the ideas it is busied about should be sometimes at least those more natural and congenial ones which it had in itself underived from the body or its own operations about them which since the waking man never remembers we must from this hypothesis conclude either that the soul remembers something that the man does not or else that memory belongs only to such ideas as are derived from the body or the minds operations about them how knows any one that the soul always thinks for if it be not a selfevident proposition it needs proof i would be glad also to learn from these men who so confidently pronounce that the human soul or which is all one that a man always thinks how they come to know it nay how they come to know that they themselves think when they themselves do not perceive it this i am afraid is to be sure without proofs and to know without perceiving it is i suspect a confused notion taken up to serve an hypothesis and none of those clear truths that either their own evidence forces us to admit or common experience makes it impudence to deny for the most that can be said of it is that it is possible the soul may always think but not always retain it in memory and i say it is as possible that the soul may not always think and much more probable that it should sometimes not think than that it should often think and that a long while together and not be conscious to itself the next moment after that it had thought that a man should be busy in thinking and yet not retain it the next moment very improbable to suppose the soul to think and the man not to perceive it is as has been said to make two persons in one man and if one considers well these mens way of speaking one should be led into a suspicion that they do so for they who tell us that the soul always thinks do never that i remember say that a man always thinks can the soul think and not the man or a man think and not be conscious of it this perhaps would be suspected of jargon in others if they say the man thinks always but is not always conscious of it they may as well say his body is extended without having parts for it is altogether as intelligible to say that a body is extended without parts as that anything thinks without being conscious of it or perceiving that it does so they who talk thus may with as much reason if it be necessary to their hypothesis say that a man is always hungry but that he does not always feel it whereas hunger consists in that very sensation as thinking consists in being conscious that one thinks if they say that a man is always conscious to himself of thinking i ask how they know it consciousness is the perception of what passes in a mans own mind can another man perceive that i am conscious of anything when i perceive it not myself no mans knowledge here can go beyond his experience wake a man out of a sound sleep and ask him what he was that moment thinking of if he himself be conscious of nothing he then thought on he must be a notable diviner of thoughts that can assure him that he was thinking may he not with more reason assure him he was not asleep this is something beyond philosophy and it cannot be less than revelation that discovers to another thoughts in my mind when i can find none there myself and they must needs have a penetrating sight who can certainly see that i think when i cannot perceive it myself and when i declare that i do not and yet can see that dogs or elephants do not think when they give all the demonstration of it imaginable except only telling us that they do so this some may suspect to be a step beyond the rosicrucians it seeming easier to make ones self invisible to others than to make anothers thoughts visible to me which are not visible to himself but it is but defining the soul to be a substance that always thinks and the business is done if such definition be of any authority i know not what it can serve for but to make many men suspect that they have no souls at all since they find a good part of their lives pass away without thinking for no defini tions that i know no suppositions of any sect are of force enough to destroy constant experience and perhaps it is the affectation of knowing beyond what we perceive that makes so much useless dispute and noise in the world no ideas but from sensation and reflection evident if we observe children i see no reason therefore to believe that the soul thinks before the senses have furnished it with ideas to think on and as those are increased and retained so it comes by exercise to improve its faculty of thinking in the several parts of it as well as afterwards by compounding those ideas and reflecting on its own operations it increases its stock as well as facility in remembering imagining reasoning and other modes of thinking state of a child in the mothers womb he that will suffer himself to be informed by observation and experience and not make his own hypothesis the rule of nature will find few signs of a soul accustomed to much thinking in a newborn child and much fewer of any reasoning at all and yet it is hard to imagine that the rational soul should think so much and not reason at all and he that will consider that infants newly come into the world spend the greatest part of their time in sleep and are seldom awake but when either hunger calls for the teat or some pain the most importunate of all sensations or some other violent impression on the body forces the mind to perceive and attend to ithe i say who considers this will perhaps find reason to imagine that a foetus in the mothers womb differs not much from the state of a vegetable but passes the greatest part of its time without perception or thought doing very little but sleep in a place where it needs not seek for food and is surrounded with liquor always equally soft and near of the same temper where the eyes have no light and the ears so shut up are not very susceptible of sounds and where there is little or no variety or change of objects to move the senses the mind thinks in proportion to the matter it gets from experience to think about follow a child from its birth and observe the alterations that time makes and you shall find as the mind by the senses comes more and more to be furnished with ideas it comes to be more and more awake thinks more the more it has matter to think on after some time it begins to know the objects which being most familiar with it have made lasting impressions thus it comes by degrees to know the persons it daily converses with and distinguishes them from strangers which are instances and effects of its coming to retain and distinguish the ideas the senses convey to it and so we may observe how the mind by degrees improves in these and advances to the exercise of those other faculties of enlarging compounding and abstracting its ideas and of reasoning about them and reflecting upon all these of which i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter a man begins to have ideas when he first has sensation what sensation is if it shall be demanded then when a man begins to have any ideas i think the true answer iswhen he first has any sensation for since there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the senses have conveyed any in i conceive that ideas in the understanding are coeval with sensation which is such an impression or motion made in some part of the body as produces some perception in the understanding it is about these impressions made on our senses by outward objects that the mind seems first to employ itself in such operations as we call perception remembering consideration reasoning c the original of all our knowledge in time the mind comes to reflect on its own operations about the ideas got by sensation and thereby stores itself with a new set of ideas which i call ideas of reflection these are the impressions that are made on our senses by outward objects that are extrinsical to the mind and its own operations proceeding from powers intrinsical and proper to itself which when reflected on by itself become also objects of its contemplationare as i have said the original of all knowledge thus the first capacity of human intellect isthat the mind is fitted to receive the impressions made on it either through the senses by outward objects or by its own operations when it reflects on them this is the first step a man makes towards the discovery of anything and the groundwork whereon to build all those notions which ever he shall have naturally in this world all those sublime thoughts which tower above the clouds and reach as high as heaven itself take their rise and footing here in all that great extent wherein the mind wanders in those remote speculations it may seem to be elevated with it stirs not one jot beyond those ideas which sense or reflection have offered for its contemplation in the reception of simple ideas the understanding is for the most part passive in this part the understanding is merely passive and whether or no it will have these beginnings and as it were materials of knowledge is not in its own power for the objects of our senses do many of them obtrude their particular ideas upon our minds whether we will or not and the operations of our minds will not let us be without at least some obscure notions of them no man can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks these simple ideas when offered to the mind the understanding can no more refuse to have nor alter when they are imprinted nor blot them out and make new ones itself than a mirror can refuse alter or obliterate the images or ideas which the objects set before it do therein produce as the bodies that surround us do diversely affect our organs the mind is forced to receive the impressions and cannot avoid the perception of those ideas that are annexed to them of simple ideas uncompounded appearances the better to understand the nature manner and extent of our knowledge one thing is carefully to be observed concerning the ideas we have and that is that some of them are simple and some complex though the qualities that affect our senses are in the things themselves so united and blended that there is no separation no distance between them yet it is plain the ideas they produce in the mind enter by the senses simple and unmixed for though the sight and touch often take in from the same object at the same time different ideasas a man sees at once motion and colour the hand feels softness and warmth in the same piece of wax yet the simple ideas thus united in the same subject are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses the coldness and hardness which a man feels in a piece of ice being as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and whiteness of a lily or as the taste of sugar and smell of a rose and there is nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception he has of those simple ideas which being each in itself uncompounded contains in it nothing but one uniform appearance or conception in the mind and is not distinguishable into different ideas the mind can neither make nor destroy them these simple ideas the materials of all our knowledge are suggested and furnished to the mind only by those two ways above mentioned viz sensation and reflection when the understanding is once stored with these simple ideas it has the power to repeat compare and unite them even to an almost infinite variety and so can make at pleasure new complex ideas but it is not in the power of the most exalted wit or enlarged understanding by any quickness or variety of thought to invent or frame one new simple idea in the mind not taken in by the ways before mentioned nor can any force of the understanding destroy those that are there the dominion of man in this little world of his own understanding being muchwhat the same as it is in the great world of visible things wherein his power however managed by art and skill reaches no farther than to compound and divide the materials that are made to his hand but can do nothing towards the making the least particle of new matter or destroying one atom of what is already in being the same inability will every one find in himself who shall go about to fashion in his understanding one simple idea not received in by his senses from external objects or by reflection from the operations of his own mind about them i would have any one try to fancy any taste which had never affected his palate or frame the idea of a scent he had never smelt and when he can do this i will also conclude that a blind man hath ideas of colours and a deaf man true distinct notions of sounds only the qualities that affect the senses are imaginable this is the reason whythough we cannot believe it impossible to god to make a creature with other organs and more ways to convey into the understanding the notice of corporeal things than those five as they are usually counted which he has given to manyet i think it is not possible for any man to imagine any other qualities in bodies howsoever constituted whereby they can be taken notice of besides sounds tastes smells visible and tangible qualities and had mankind been made but with four senses the qualities then which are the objects of the fifth sense had been as far from our notice imagination and conception as now any belonging to a sixth seventh or eighth sense can possibly bewhich whether yet some other creatures in some other parts of this vast and stupendous universe may not have will be a great presumption to deny he that will not set himself proudly at the top of all things but will consider the immensity of this fabric and the great variety that is to be found in this little and inconsiderable part of it which he has to do with may be apt to think that in other mansions of it there may be other and different intelligent beings of whose faculties he has as little knowledge or apprehension as a worm shut up in one drawer of a cabinet hath of the senses or understanding of a man such variety and excellency being suitable to the wisdom and power of the maker i have here followed the common opinion of mans having but five senses though perhaps there may be justly counted morebut either supposition serves equally to my present purpose of simple ideas of sense division of simple ideas the better to conceive the ideas we receive from sensation it may not be amiss for us to consider them in reference to the different ways whereby they make their approaches to our minds and make themselves perceivable by us first then there are some which come into our minds by one sense only secondly there are others that convey themselves into the mind by more senses than one thirdly others that are had from reflection only fourthly there are some that make themselves way and are suggested to the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection we shall consider them apart under these several heads ideas of one sense there are some ideas which have admittance only through one sense which is peculiarly adapted to receive them thus light and colours as white red yellow blue with their several degrees or shades and mixtures as green scarlet purple seagreen and the rest come in only by the eyes all kinds of noises sounds and tones only by the ears the several tastes and smells by the nose and palate and if these organs or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brainthe minds presenceroom as i may so call itare any of them so disordered as not to perform their functions they have no postern to be admitted by no other way to bring themselves into view and be perceived by the understanding the most considerable of those belonging to the touch are heat and cold and solidity all the rest consisting almost wholly in the sensible configuration as smooth and rough or else more or less firm adhesion of the parts as hard and soft tough and brittle are obvious enough few simple ideas have names i think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple ideas belonging to each sense nor indeed is it possible if we would there being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses than we have names for the variety of smells which are as many almost if not more than species of bodies in the world do most of them want names sweet and stinking commonly serve our turn for these ideas which in effect is little more than to call them pleasing or displeasing though the smell of a rose and violet both sweet are certainly very distinct ideas nor are the different tastes that by our palates we receive ideas of much better provided with names sweet bitter sour harsh and salt are almost all the epithets we have to denominate that numberless variety of relishes which are to be found distinct not only in almost every sort of creatures but in the different parts of the same plant fruit or animal the same may be said of colours and sounds i shall therefore in the account of simple ideas i am here giving content myself to set down only such as are most material to our present purpose or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though they are very frequently the ingredients of our complex ideas amongst which i think i may well account solidity which therefore i shall treat of in the next chapter idea of solidity we receive this idea from touch the idea of solidity we receive by our touch and it arises from the resistance which we find in body to the entrance of any other body into the place it possesses till it has left it there is no idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity whether we move or rest in what posture soever we are we always feel something under us that support us and hinders our further sinking downwards and the bodies which we daily handle make us perceive that whilst they remain between them they do by an insurmountable force hinder the approach of the parts of our hands that press them that which thus hinders the approach of two bodies when they are moved one towards another i call solidity i will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid be nearer to its original signification than that which mathematicians use it in it suffices that i think the common notion of solidity will allow if not justify this use of it but if any one think it better to call it impenetrability he has my consent only i have thought the term solidity the more proper to express this idea not only because of its vulgar use in that sense but also because it carries something more of positive in it than impenetrability which is negative and is perhaps more a consequence of solidity than solidity itself this of all other seems the idea most intimately connected with and essential to body so as nowhere else to be found or imagined but only in matter and though our senses take no notice of it but in masses of matter of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in us yet the mind having once got this idea from such grosser sensible bodies traces it further and considers it as well as figure in the minutest particle of matter that can exist and finds it inseparably inherent in body wherever or however modified solidity fills space this is the idea which belongs to body whereby we conceive it to fill space the idea of which filling of space isthat where we imagine any space taken up by a solid substance we conceive it so to possess it that it excludes all other solid substances and will for ever hinder any other two bodies that move towards one another in a straight line from coming to touch one another unless it removes from between them in a line not parallel to that which they move in this idea of it th e bodies whichwe ordinarily handle sufficiently furnish us with distinct from space this resistance whereby it keeps other bodies out of the space which it possesses is so great that no force how great soever can surmount it all the bodies in the world pressing a drop of water on all sides will never be able to overcome the resistance which it will make soft as it is to their approaching one another till it be removed out of their way whereby our idea of solidity is distinguished both from pure space which is capable neither of resistance nor motion and from the ordinary idea of hardness for a man may conceive two bodies at a distance so as they may approach one another without touching or displacing any solid thing till their superficies come to meet whereby i think we have the clear idea of space without solidity for not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body i ask whether a man cannot have the idea of the motion of one single body alone without any other succeeding immediately into its place i think it is evident he can the idea of motion in one body no more including the idea of motion in another than the idea of a square figure in one body includes the idea of a square figure in another i do not ask whether bodies do so exist that the motion of one body cannot really be without the motion of another to determine this either way is to beg the question for or against a vacuum but my question iswhether one cannot have the idea of one body moved whilst others are at rest and i think this no one will deny if so then the place it deserted gives us the idea of pure space without solidity whereinto any other body may enter without either resistance or protrusion of anything when the sucker in a pump is drawn the space it filled in the tube is certainly the same whether any other body follows the motion of the sucker or not nor does it imply a contradiction that upon the motion of one body another that is only contiguous to it should not follow it the necessity of such a motion is built only on the supposition that the world is full but not on the distinct ideas of space and solidity which are as different as resistance and not resistance protrusion and not protrusion and that men have ideas of space without a body their very disputes about a vacuum plainly demonstrate as is shown in another place from hardness solidity is hereby also differenced from hardness in that solidity consists in repletion and so an utter exclusion of other bodies out of the space it possesses but hardness in a firm cohesion of the parts of matter making up masses of a sensible bulk so that the whole does not easily change its figure and indeed hard and soft are names that we give to things only in relation to the constitutions of our own bodies that being generally called hard by us which will put us to pain sooner than change figure by the pressure of any part of our bodies and that on the contrary soft which changes the situation of its parts upon an easy and unpainful touch but this difficulty of changing the situation of the sensible parts amongst themselves or of the figure of the whole gives no more solidity to the hardest body in the world than to the softest nor is an adamant one jot more solid than water for though the two flat sides of two pieces of marble will more easily approach each other between which there is nothing but water or air than if there be a diamond between them yet it is not that the parts of the diamond are more solid than those of water or resist more but because the parts of water being more easily separable from each other they will by a side motion be more easily removed and give way to the approach of the two pieces of marble but if they could be kept from making place by that side motion they would eternally hinder the approach of these two pieces of marble as much as the diamond and it would be as impossible by any force to surmount their resistance as to surmount the resistance of the parts of a diamond the softest body in the world will as invincibly resist the coming together of any other two bodies if it be not put out of the way but remain between them as the hardest that can be found or imagined he that shall fill a yielding soft body well with air or water will quickly find its resistance and he that thinks that nothing but bodies that are hard can keep his hands from approaching one another may be pleased to make a trial with the air inclosed in a football the experiment i have been told was made at florence with a hollow globe of gold filled with water and exactly closed which further shows the solidity of so soft a body as water for the golden globe thus filled being put into a press which was driven by the extreme force of screws the water made itself way through the pores of that very close metal and finding no room for a nearer approach of its particles within got to the outside where it rose like a dew and so fell in drops before the sides of the globe could be made to yield to the violent compression of the engine that squeezed it on solidity depend impulse resistance and protrusion by this idea of solidity is the extension of body distinguished from the extension of spacethe extension of body being nothing but the cohesion or continuity of solid separable movable parts and the extension of space the continuity of unsolid inseparable and immovable parts upon the solidity of bodies also depend their mutual impulse resistance and protrusion of pure space then and solidity there are several amongst which i confess myself one who persuade themselves they have clear and distinct ideas and that they can think on space without anything in it that resists or is protruded by body this is the idea of pure space which they think they have as clear as any idea they can have of the extension of body the idea of the distance between the oppo site parts of a concave superficies being equally as clear without as with the idea of any solid parts between and on the other side they persuade themselves that they have distinct from that of pure space the idea of something that fills space that can be protruded by the impulse of other bodies or resist their motion if there be others that have not these two ideas distinct but confound them and make but one of them i know not how men who have the same idea under different names or different ideas under the same name can in that case talk with one another any more than a man who not being blind or deaf has distinct ideas of the colour of scarlet and the sound of a trumpet could discourse concerning scarlet colour with the blind man i mentioned in another place who fancied that the idea of scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet what solidity is if any one ask me what this solidity is i send him to his senses to inform him let him put a flint or a football between his hands and then endeavour to join them and he will know if he thinks this not a sufficient explication of solidity what it is and wherein it consists i promise to tell him what it is and wherein it consists when he tells me what thinking is or wherein it consists or explains to me what extension or motion is which perhaps seems much easier the simple ideas we have are such as experience teaches them us but if beyond that we endeavour by words to make them clearer in the mind we shall succeed no better than if we went about to clear up the darkness of a blind mans mind by talking and to discourse into him the ideas of light and colours the reason of this i shall show in another place of simple ideas of divers senses ideas received both by seeing and touching the ideas we get by more than one sense are of space or extension figure rest and motion for these make perceivable impressions both on the eyes and touch and we can receive and convey into our minds the ideas of the extension figure motion and rest of bodies both by seeing and feeling but having occasion to speak more at large of these in another place i here only enumerate them i of simple ideas of reflection simple ideas are the operations of mind about its other ideas the mind receiving the ideas mentioned in the foregoing chapters from without when it turns its view inward upon itself and observes its own actions about those ideas it has takes from thence other ideas which are as capable to be the objects of its contemplation as any of those it received from foreign things the idea of perception and idea of willing we have from reflection the two great and principal actions of the mind which are most frequently considered and which are so frequent that every one that pleases may take notice of them in himself are these two perception or thinking and volition or willing the power of thinking is called the understanding and the power of volition is called the will and these two powers or abilities in the mind are denominated faculties of some of the modes of these simple ideas of reflection such as are remembrance discerning reasoning judging knowledge faith c i shall have occasion to speak hereafter ii of simple ideas of both sensation and reflection ideas of pleasure and pain there be other simple ideas which convey themselves into the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection viz pleasure or delight and its opposite pain or uneasiness power existence unity mix with almost all our other ideas delight or uneasiness one or other of them join themselves to almost all our ideas both of sensation and reflection and there is scarce any affection of our senses from with out any retired thought of our mind within which is not able to produce in us pleasure or pain by pleasure and pain i would be understood to signify whatsoever delights or molests us whether it arises from the thoughts of our minds or anything operating on our bodies for whether we call it satisfaction delight pleasure happiness c on the one side or uneasiness trouble pain torment anguish misery c on the other they are still but different degrees of the same thing and belong to the ideas of pleasure and pain delight or uneasiness which are the names i shall most commonly use for those two sorts of ideas as motives of our actions the infinite wise author of our being having given us the power over several parts of our bodies to move or keep them at rest as we think fit and also by the motion of them to move ourselves and other contiguous bodies in which consist all the actions of our body having also given a power to our minds in several instances to choose amongst its ideas which it will think on and to pursue the inquiry of this or that subject with consideration and attention to excite us to these actions of thinking and motion that we are capable ofhas been pleased to join to several thoughts and several sensations a perception of delight if this were wholly separated from all our outward sensations and inward thoughts we should have no reason to prefer one thought or action to another negligence to attention or motion to rest and so we should neither stir our bodies nor employ our minds but let our thoughts if i may so call it run adrift without any direction or design and suffer the ideas of our minds like unregarded shadows to make their appearances there as it happened without attending to them in which state man however furnished with the faculties of understanding and will would be a very idle inactive creature and pass his time only in a lazy lethargic dream it has therefore pleased our wise creator to annex to several objects and the ideas which we receive from them as also to several of our thoughts a concomitant pleasure and that in several objects to several degrees that those faculties which he had endowed us with might not remain wholly idle and unemployed by us an end and use of pain pain has the same efficacy and use to set us on work that pleasure has we being as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that as to pursue this only this is worth our consideration that pain is often produced by the same objects and ideas that produce pleasure in us this their near conjunction which makes us often feel pain in the sensations where we expected pleasure gives us new occasion of admiring the wisdom and goodness of our maker who designing the preservation of our being has annexed pain to the application of many things to our bodies to warn us of the harm that they will do and as advices to withdraw from them but he not designing our preservation barely but the preservation of every part and organ in its perfection hath in many cases annexed pain to those very ideas which delight us thus heat that is very agreeable to us in one degree by a little greater increase of it proves no ordinary torment and the most pleasant of all sensible objects light itself if there be too much of it if increased beyond a due proportion to our eyes causes a very painful sensation which is wisely and favourably so ordered by nature that when any object does by the vehemency of its operation disorder the instruments of sensation whose structures cannot but be very nice and delicate we might by the pain be warned to withdraw before the organ be quite put out of order and so be unfitted for its proper function for the future the consideration of those objects that produce it may well persuade us that this is the end or use of pain for though great light be insufferable to our eyes yet the highest degree of darkness does not at all disease them because that causing no disorderly motion in it leaves that curious organ unharmed in its natural state but yet excess of cold as well as heat pains us because it is equally destructive to that temper which is necessary to the preservation of life and the exercise of the several functions of the body and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth or if you please a motion of the insensible parts of our bodies confined within certain bounds another end beyond all this we may find another reason why god hath scattered up and down several degrees of pleasure and pain in all the things that environ and affect us and blended them together in almost all that our thoughts and senses have to do withthat we finding imperfection dissatisfaction and want of complete happiness in all the enjoyments which the creatures can afford us might be led to seek it in the enjoyment of him with whom there is fullness of joy and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore goodness of god in annexing pleasure and pain to our other ideas though what i have here said may not perhaps make the ideas of pleasure and pain clearer to us than our own experience does which is the only way that we are capable of having them yet the consideration of the reason why they are annexed to so many other ideas serving to give us due sentiments of the wisdom and goodness of the sovereign disposer of all things may not be unsuitable to the main end of these inquiries the knowledge and veneration of him being the chief end of all our thoughts and the proper business of all understandings ideas of existence and unity existence and unity are two other ideas that are suggested to the understanding by every object without and every idea within when ideas are in our minds we consider them as being actually there as well as we consider things to be actually without uswhich is that they exist or have existence and whatever we can consider as one thing whether a real being or idea suggests to the understanding the idea of unity idea of power power also is another of those simple ideas which we receive from sensation and reflection for observing in ourselves that we do and can think and that we can at pleasure move several parts of our bodies which were at rest the effects also that natural bodies are able to produce in one another occurring every moment to our senseswe both these ways get the idea of power idea of succession besides these there is another idea which though suggested by our senses yet is more constantly offered to us by what passes in our minds and that is the idea of succession for if we look immediately into ourselves and reflect on what is observable there we shall find our ideas always whilst we are awake or have any thought passing in train one going and another coming without intermission simple ideas the materials of all our knowledge these if they are not all are at least as i think the most considerable of those simple ideas which the mind has and out of which is made all its other knowledge all which it receives only by the two forementioned ways of sensation and reflection nor let any one think these too narrow bounds for the capacious mind of man to expatiate in which takes its flight further than the stars and cannot be confined by the limits of the world that extends its thoughts often even beyond the utmost expansion of matter and makes excursions into that incomprehensible inane i grant all this but desire any one to assign any simple idea which is not received from one of those inlets before mentioned or any complex idea not made out of those simple ones nor will it be so strange to think these few simple ideas sufficient to employ the quickest thought or largest capacity and to furnish the materials of all that various knowledge and more various fancies and opinions of all mankind if we consider how many words may be made out of the various composition of twentyfour letters or if going one step further we will but reflect on the variety of combinations that may be made with barely one of the abovementioned ideas viz number whose stock is inexhaustible and truly infinite and what a large and immense field doth extension alone afford the mathematicians iii some further considerations concerning our simple ideas of sensation positive ideas from privative causes concerning the simple ideas of sensation it is to be consideredthat whatsoever is so constituted in nature as to be able by affecting our senses to cause any perception in the mind doth thereby produce in the understanding a simple idea which whatever be the external cause of it when it comes to be taken notice of by our discerning faculty it is by the mind looked on and considered there to be a real positive idea in the understanding as much as any other whatsoever though perhaps the cause of it be but a privation of the subject ideas in the mind distinguished from that in things which gives rise to them thus the ideas of heat and cold light and darkness white and black motion and rest are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind though perhaps some of the causes which produce them are barely privations in those subjects from whence our senses derive those ideas these the understanding in its view of them considers all as distinct positive ideas without taking notice of the causes that produce them which is an inquiry not belonging to the idea as it is in the understanding but to the nature of the things existing without us these are two very different things and carefully to be distinguished it being one thing to perceive and know the idea of white or black and quite another to examine what kind of particles they must be and how ranged in the superficies to make any object appear white or black we may have the ideas when we are ignorant of their physical causes a painter or dyer who never inquired into their causes hath the ideas of white and black and other colours as clearly perfectly and distinctly in his understanding and perhaps more distinctly than the philosopher who hath busied himself in considering their natures and thinks he knows how far either of them is in its cause positive or privative and the idea of black is no less positive in his mind than that of white however the cause of that colour in the external object may be only a privation why a privative cause in nature may occasion a positive idea if it were the design of my present undertaking to inquire into the natural causes and manner of perception i should offer this as a reason why a privative cause might in some cases at least produce a positive idea viz that all sensation being produced in us only by different degrees and modes of motion in our animal spirits variously agitated by external objects the abatement of any former motion must as necessarily produce a new sensation as the variation or increase of it and so introduce a new idea which depends only on a different motion of the animal spirits in that organ negative names need not be meaningless but whether this be so or not i will not here determine but appeal to every ones own experience whether the shadow of a man though it consists of nothing but the absence of light and the more the absence of light is the more discernible is the shadow does not when a man looks on it cause as clear and positive idea in his mind as a man himself though covered over with clear sunshine and the picture of a shadow is a positive thing indeed we have negative names which stand not directly for positive ideas but for their absence such as insipid silence nihil c which words denote positive ideas vg taste sound being with a signification of their absence whether any ideas are due to causes really privative and thus one may truly be said to see darkness for supposing a hole perfectly dark from whence no light is reflected it is certain one may see the figure of it or it may be painted or whether the ink i write with makes any other idea is a question the privative causes i have here assigned of positive ideas are according to the common opinion but in truth it will be hard to determine whether there be really any ideas from a privative cause till it be determined whether rest be any more a privation than motion ideas in the mind qualities in bodies to discover the nature of our ideas the better and to discourse of them intelligibly it will be convenient to distinguish them as they are ideas or perceptions in our minds and as they are modifications of matter in the bodies that cause such perceptions in us that so we may not think as perhaps usually is done that they are exactly the images and resemblances of something inherent in the subject most of those of sensation being in the mind no more the likeness of something existing without us than the names that stand for them are the likeness of our ideas which yet upon hearing they are apt to excite in us our ideas and the qualities of bodies whatsoever the mind perceives in itself or is the immediate object of perception thought or understanding that i call idea and the power to produce any idea in our mind i call quality of the subject wherein that power is thus a snowball having the power to produce in us the ideas of white cold and roundthe power to produce those ideas in us as they are in the snowball i call qualities and as they are sensations or perceptions in our understandings i call them ideas which ideas if i speak of sometimes as in the things themselves i would be understood to mean those qualities in the objects which produce them in us primary qualities of bodies qualities thus considered in bodies are first such as are utterly inseparable from the body in what state soever it be and such as in all the alterations and changes it suffers all the force can be used upon it it constantly keeps and such as sense constantly finds in every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived and the mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter though less than to make itself singly be perceived by our senses vg take a grain of wheat divide it into two parts each part has still solidity extension figure and mobility divide it again and it retains still the same qualities and so divide it on till the parts become insensible they must retain still each of them all those qualities for division which is all that a mill or pestle or any other body does upon another in reducing it to insensible parts can never take away either solidity extension figure or mobility from any body but only makes two or more distinct separate masses of matter of that which was but one before all which distinct masses reckoned as so many distinct bodies after division make a certain number these i call original or primary qualities of body which i think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us viz solidity extension figure motion or rest and number secondary qualities of bodies secondly such qualities which in truth are nothing in the objects themselves but power to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities ie by the bulk figure texture and motion of their insensible parts as colours sounds tastes c these i call secondary qualities to these might be added a third sort which are allowed to be barely powers though they are as much real qualities in the subject as those which i to comply with the common way of speaking call qualities but for distinction secondary qualities for the power in fire to produce a new colour or consistency in wax or clayby its primary qualities is as much a quality in fire as the power it has to produce in me a new idea or sensation of warmth or burning which i felt not beforeby the same primary qualities viz the bulk texture and motion of its insensible parts how bodies produce ideas in us the next thing to be considered is how bodies produce ideas in us and that is manifestly by impulse the only way which we can conceive bodies to operate in by motions external and in our organism if then external objects be not united to our minds when they produce ideas therein and yet we perceive these original qualities in such of them as singly fall under our senses it is evident that some motion must be thence continued by our nerves or animal spirits by some parts of our bodies to the brains or the seat of sensation there to produce in our minds the particular ideas we have of them and since the extension figure number and motion of bodies of an observable bigness may be perceived at a distance by the sight it is evident some singly imperceptible bodies must come from them to the eyes and thereby convey to the brain some motion which produces these ideas which we have of them in us how secondary qualities produce their ideas after the same manner that the ideas of these original qualities are produced in us we may conceive that the ideas of secondary qualities are also produced viz by the operation of insensible particles on our senses for it being manifest that there are bodies and good store of bodies each whereof are so small that we cannot by any of our senses discover either their bulk figure or motionas is evident in the particles of the air and water and others extremely smaller than those perhaps as much smaller than the particles of air and water as the particles of air and water are smaller than peas or hailstoneslet us suppose at present that the differ ent motions and figures bulk and number of such particles affecting the several organs of our senses produce in us those different sensations which we have from the colours and smells of bodies vg that a violet by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter of peculiar figures and bulks and in different degrees and modifications of their motions causes the ideas of the blue colour and sweet scent of that flower to be produced in our minds it being no more impossible to conceive that god should annex such ideas to such motions with which they have no similitude than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel dividing our flesh with which that idea hath no resemblance they depend on the primary qualities what i have said concerning colours and smells may be understood also of tastes and sounds and other the like sensible qualities which whatever reality we by mistake attribute to them are in truth nothing in the objects themselves but powers to produce various sensations in us and depend on those primary qualities viz bulk figure texture and motion of parts as i have said ideas of primary qualities are resemblances of secondary not from whence i think it easy to draw this observationthat the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are resemblances of them and their patterns do really exist in the bodies themselves but the ideas produced in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all there is nothing like our ideas existing in the bodies themselves they are in the bodies we denominate from them only a power to produce those sensations in us and what is sweet blue or warm in idea is but the certain bulk figure and motion of the insensible parts in the bodies themselves which we call so examples flame is denominated hot and light snow white and cold and manna white and sweet from the ideas they produce in us which qualities are commonly thought to be the same in those bodies that those ideas are in us the one the perfect resemblance of the other as they are in a mirror and it would by most men be judged very extravagant if one should say otherwise and yet he that will consider that the same fire that at one distance produces in us the sensation of warmth does at a nearer approach produce in us the far different sensation of pain ought to bethink himself what reason he has to saythat this idea of warmth which was produced in him by the fire is actually in the fire and his idea of pain which the same fire produced in him the same way is not in the fire why are whiteness and coldness in snow and pain not when it produces the one and the other idea in us and can do neither but by the bulk figure number and motion of its solid parts the ideas of the primary alone really exist the particular bulk number figure and motion of the parts of fire or snow are really in themwhether any ones senses perceive them or no and therefore they may be called real qualities because they really exist in those bodies but light heat whiteness or coldness are no more really in them than sickness or pain is in manna take away the sensation of them let not the eyes see light or colours nor the ears hear sounds let the palate not taste nor the nose smell and all colours tastes odours and sounds as they are such particular ideas vanish and cease and are reduced to their causes ie bulk figure and motion of parts the secondary exist in things only as modes of the primary a piece of manna of a sensible bulk is able to produce in us the idea of a round or square figure and by being removed from one place to another the idea of motion this idea of motion represents it as it really is in manna moving a circle or square are the same whether in idea or existence in the mind or in the manna and this both motion and figure are really in the manna whether we take notice of them or no this everybody is ready to agree to besides manna by tie bulk figure texture and motion of its parts has a power to produce the sensations of sickness and sometimes of acute pains or gripings in us that these ideas of sickness and pain are not in the manna but effects of its operations on us and are nowhere when we feel them not this also every one readily agrees to and yet men are hardly to be brought to think that sweetness and whiteness are not really in manna which are but the effects of the operations of manna by the motion size and figure of its particles on the eyes and palate as the pain and sickness caused by manna are confessedly nothing but the effects of its operations on the stomach and guts by the size motion and figure of its insensible parts for by nothing else can a body operate as has been proved as if it could not operate on the eyes and palate and thereby produce in the mind particular distinct ideas which in itself it has not as well as we allow it can operate on the guts and stomach and thereby produce distinct ideas which in itself it has not these ideas being all effects of the operations of manna on several parts of our bodies by the size figure number and motion of its partswhy those produced by the eyes and palate should rather be thought to be really in the manna than those produced by the stomach and guts or why the pain and sickness ideas that are the effect of manna should be thought to be nowhere when they are not felt and yet the sweetness and whiteness effects of the same manna on other parts of the body by ways equally as unknown should be thought to exist in the manna when they are not seen or tasted would need some reason to explain examples let us consider the red and white colours in porphyry hinder light from striking on it and its colours vanish it no longer produces any such ideas in us upon the return of light it produces these appearances on us again can any one think any real alterations are made in the porphyry by the presence or absence of light and that those ideas of whiteness and redness are really in porphyry in the light when it is plain it has no colour in the dark it has indeed such a configuration of particles both night and day as are apt by the rays of light rebounding from some parts of that hard stone to produce in us the idea of redness and from others the idea of whiteness but whiteness or redness are not in it at any time but such a texture that hath the power to produce such a sensation in us pound an almond and the clear white colour will be altered into a dirty one and the sweet taste into an oily one what real alteration can the beating of the pestle make in any body but an alteration of the texture of it explains how water felt as cold by one hand may be warm to the other ideas being thus distinguished and understood we may be able to give an account how the same water at the same time may produce the idea of cold by one hand and of heat by the other whereas it is impossible that the same water if those ideas were really in it should at the same time be both hot and cold for if we imagine warmth as it is in our hands to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the minute particles of our nerves or animal spirits we may understand how it is possible that the same water may at the same time produce the sensations of heat in one hand and cold in the other which yet figure never does that never producingthe idea of a square by one hand which has produced the idea of a globe by another but if the sensation of heat and cold be nothing but the increase or diminution of the motion of the minute parts of our bodies caused by the corpuscles of any other body it is easy to be understood that if that motion be greater in one hand than in the other if a body be applied to the two hands which has in its minute particles a greater motion than in those of one of the hands and a less than in those of the other it will increase the motion of the one hand and lessen it in the other and so cause the different sensations of heat and cold that depend thereon an excursion into natural philosophy i have in what just goes before been engaged in physical inquiries a little further than perhaps i intended but it being necessary to make the nature of sensation a little understood and to make the difference between the qualities in bodies and the ideas produced by them in the mind to be distinctly conceived without which it were impossible to discourse intelligibly of themi hope i shall be pardoned this little excursion into natural philosophy it being necessary in our present inquiry to distinguish the primary and real qualities of bodies which are always in them viz solidity extension figure number and motion or rest and are sometimes perceived by us viz when the bodies they are in are big enough singly to be discerned from those secondary and imputed qualities which are but the powers of several combinations of those primary ones when they operate without being distinctly discernedwhereby we may also come to know what ideas are and what are not resemblances of something really existing in the bodies we denominate from them three sorts of qualities in bodies the qualities then that are in bodies rightly considered are of three sorts first the bulk figure number situation and motion or rest of their solid parts those are in them whether we perceive them or not and when they are of that size that we can discover them we have by these an idea of the thing as it is in itself as is plain in artificial things these i call primary qualities secondly the power that is in any body by reason of its insensible primary qualities to operate after a peculiar manner on any of our senses and thereby produce in us the different ideas of several colours sounds smells tastes c these are usually called sensible qualities thirdly the power that is in any body by reason of the particular constitution of its primary qualities to make such a change in the bulk figure texture and motion of another body as to make it operate on our senses differently from what it did before thus the sun has a power to make wax white and fire to make lead fluid these are usually called powers the first of these as has been said i think may be properly called real original or primary qualities because they are in the things themselves whether they are perceived or not and upon their different modifications it is that the secondary qualities depend the other two are only powers to act differently upon other things which powers result from the different modifications of those primary qualities the first are resemblances the second thought to be resemblances but are not the third neither are nor are thought so but though the two latter sorts of qualities are powers barely and nothing but powers relating to several other bodies and resulting from the different modifications of the original qualities yet they are generally otherwise thought of for the second sort viz the powers to produce several ideas in us by our senses are looked upon as real qualities in the things thus affecting us but the third sort are called and esteemed barely powers vg the idea of heat or light which we receive by our eyes or touch from the sun are commonly thought real qualities existing in the sun and something more than mere powers in it but when we consider the sun in reference to wax which it melts or blanches we look on the whiteness and softness produced in the wax not as qualities in the sun but effects produced by powers in it whereas if rightly considered these qualities of light and warmth which are perceptions in me when i am warmed or enlightened by the sun are no otherwise in the sun than the changes made in the wax when it is blanched or melted are in the sun they are all of them equally powers in the sun depending on its primary qualities whereby it is able in the one case so to alter the bulk figure texture or motion of some of the insensible parts of my eyes or hands as thereby to produce in me the idea of light or heat and in the other it is able so to alter the bulk figure texture or motion of the insensible parts of the wax as to make them fit to produce in me the distinct ideas of white and fluid why the secondary are ordinarily taken for real qualities and not for bare powers the reason why the one are ordinarily taken for real qualities and the other only for bare powers seems to be because the ideas we have of distinct colours sounds c containing nothing at all in them of bulk figure or motion we are not apt to think them the effects of these primary qualities which appear not to our senses to operate in their production and with which they have not any apparent congruity or conceivable connexion hence it is that we are so forward to imagine that those ideas are the resemblances of something really existing in the objects themselves since sensation discovers nothing of bulk figure or motion of parts in their production nor can reason show how bodies by their bulk figure and motion should produce in the mind the ideas of blue or yellow c but in the other case in the operations of bodies changing the qualities one of another we plainly discover that the quality produced hath commonly no resemblance with anything in the thing producing it wherefore we look on it as a bare effect of power for through receiving the idea of heat or light from the sun we are apt to think it is a perception and resemblance of such a quality in the sun yet when we see wax or a fair face receive change of colour from the sun we cannot imagine that to be the reception or resemblance of anything in the sun because we find not those different colours in the sun itself for our senses being able to observe a likeness or unlikeness of sensible qualities in two different external objects we forwardly enough conclude the production of any sensible quality in any subject to be an effect of bare power and not the communication of any quality which was really in the efficient when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that produced it but our senses not being able to discover any unlikeness between the idea produced in us and the quality of the object producing it we are apt to imagine that our ideas are resemblances of something in the objects and not the effects of certain powers placed in the modification of their primary qualities with which primary qualities the ideas produced in us have no resemblance secondary qualities twofold first immediately perceivable secondly mediately perceivable to conclude besides those beforementioned primary qualities in bodies viz bulk figure extension number and motion of their solid parts all the rest whereby we take notice of bodies and distinguish them one from another are nothing else but several powers in them depending on those primary qualities whereby they are fitted either by immediately operating on our bodies to produce several different ideas in us or else by operating on other bodies so to change their primary qualities as to render them capable of producing ideas in us different from what before they did the former of these i think may be called secondary qualities immediately perceivable the latter secondary qualities mediately perceivable of perception perception the first simple idea of reflection perception as it is the first faculty of the mind exercised about our ideas so it is the first and simplest idea we have from reflection and is by some called thinking in general though thinking in the propriety of the english tongue signifies that sort of operation in the mind about its ideas wherein the mind is active where it with some degree of voluntary attention considers anything for in bare naked perception the mind is for the most part only passive and what it perceives it cannot avoid perceiving reflection alone can give us the idea of what perception is what perception is every one will know better by reflecting on what he does himself when he sees hears feels c or thinks than by any discourse of mine whoever reflects on what passes in his own mind cannot miss it and if he does not reflect all the words in the world cannot make him have any notion of it arises in sensation only when the mind notices the organic impression this is certain that whatever alterations are made in the body if they reach not the mind whatever impressions are made on the outward parts if they are not taken notice of within there is no perception fire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it does a billet unless the motion be continued to the brain and there the sense of heat or idea of pain be produced in the mind wherein consists actual perception impulse on the organ insufficient how often may a man observe in himself that whilst his mind is intently employed in the contemplation of some objects and curiously surveying some ideas that are there it takes no notice of impressions of sounding bodies made upon the organ of hearing with the same alteration that uses to be for the producing the idea of sound a sufficient impulse there may be on the organ but it not reaching the observation of the mind there follows no perception and though the motion that uses to produce the idea of sound be made in the ear yet no sound is heard want of sensation in this case is not through any de fect in the organ or that the mans ears are less affected than at other times when he does hear but that which uses to produce the idea though conveyed in by the usual organ not being taken notice of in the understanding and so imprinting no idea in the mind there follows no sensation so that wherever there is sense or perception there some idea is actually produced and present in the understanding children though they may have ideas in the womb have none innate therefore i doubt not but children by the exercise of their senses about objects that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas before they are born as the unavoidable effects either of the bodies that environ them or else of those wants or diseases they suffer amongst which if one may conjecture concerning things not very capable of examination i think the ideas of hunger and warmth are two which probably are some of the first that children have and which they scarce ever part with again the effects of sensation in the womb but though it be reasonable to imagine that children receive some ideas before they come into the world yet these simple ideas are far from those innate principles which some contend for and we above have rejected these here mentioned being the effects of sensation are only from some affections of the body which happen to them there and so depend on something exterior to the mind no otherwise differing in their manner of production from other ideas derived from sense but only in the precedency of time whereas those innate principles are supposed to be quite of another nature not coming into the mind by any accidental alterations in or operations on the body but as it were original characters impressed upon it in the very first moment of its being and constitution which ideas appear first is not evident nor important as there are some ideas which we may reasonably suppose may be introduced into the minds of children in the womb subservient to the necessities of their life and being there so after they are born those ideas are the earliest imprinted which happen to be the sensible qualities which first occur to them amongst which light is not the least considerable nor of the weakest efficacy and how covetous the mind is to be furnished with all such ideas as have no pain accompanying them may be a little guessed by what is observable in children newborn who always turn their eyes to that part from whence the light comes lay them how you please but the ideas that are most familiar at first being various according to the divers circumstances of childrens first entertainment in the world the order wherein the several ideas come at first into the mind is very various and uncertain also neither is it much material to know it sensations often changed by the judgment we are further to consider concerning perception that the ideas we receive by sensation are often in grown people altered by the judgment without our taking notice of it when we set before our eyes a round globe of any uniform colour vg gold alabaster or jet it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted on our mind is of a flat circle variously shadowed with several degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes but we having by use been accustomed to perceive what kind of appearance convex bodies are wont to make in us what alterations are made in the reflections of light by the difference of the sensible figures of bodiesthe judgment presently by an habitual custom alters the appearances into their causes so that from that which is truly variety of shadow or colour collecting the figure it makes it pass for a mark of figure and frames to itself the perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously coloured as is evident in painting to which purpose i shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge the learned and worthy mr molyneux which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since and it is thissuppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and the other which is the cube which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man be made to see quaere whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answers not for though he has obtained the experience of how a globe how a cube affects his touch yet he has not yet obtained the experience that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that pressed his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it does in the cubei agree with this thinking gentleman whom i am proud to call my friend in his answer to this problem and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them though he could unerringly name them by his touch and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt this i have set down and leave with my reader as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience improvement and acquired notions where he thinks he had not the least use of or help from them and the rather because this observing gentleman further adds that having upon the occasion of my book proposed this to divers very ingenious men he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true till by hearing his reasons they were convinced this judgment apt to be mistaken for direct perception but this is not i think usual in any of our ideas but those received by sight because sight the most comprehensive of all our senses conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours which are peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion the several varieties whereof change the appearances of its proper object viz light and colours we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by the other this in many cases by a settled habitin things whereof we have frequent experience is performed so constantly and so quick that we take that for the perception of our sensation which is an idea formed by our judgment so that one viz that of sensation serves only to excite the other and is scarce taken notice of itselfas a man who reads or hears with attention and understanding takes little notice of the characters or sounds but of the ideas that are excited in him by them how by habit ideas of sensation are unconsciously changed into ideas of judgment nor need we wonder that this is done with so little notice if we consider how quick the actions of the mind are performed for as itself is thought to take up no space to have no extension so its actions seem to require no time but many of them seem to be crowded into an instant i speak this in comparison to the actions of the body any one may easily observe this in his own thoughts who will take the pains to reflect on them how as it were in an instant do our minds with one glance see all the parts of a demonstration which may very well be called a long one if we consider the time it will require to put it into words and step by step show it another secondly we shall not be so much surprised that this is done in us with so little notice if we consider how the facility which we get of doing things by a custom of doing makes them often pass in us without our notice habits especially such as are begun very early come at last to produce actions in us which often escape our observation how frequently do we in a day cover our eyes with our eyelids without perceiving that we are at all in the dark men that by custom have got the use of a byword do almost in every sentence pronounce sounds which though taken notice of by others they themselves neither hear nor observe and therefore it is not so strange that our mind should often change the idea of its sensation into that of its judgment and make one serve only to excite the other without our taking notice of it perception puts the difference between animals and vegetables this faculty of perception seems to me to be that which puts the distinction betwixt the animal kingdom and the inferior parts of nature for however vegetables have many of them some degrees of motion and upon the different application of other bodies to them do very briskly alter their figures and motions and so have obtained the name of sensitive plants from a motion which has some resemblance to that which in animals follows upon sensation yet i suppose it is all bare mechanism and no otherwise produced than the turning of a wild oatbeard by the insinuation of the particles of moisture or the shortening of a rope by the affusion of water all which is done without any sensation in the subject or the having or receiving any ideas perception in all animals perception i believe is in some degree in all sorts of animals though in some possibly the avenues provided by nature for the reception of sensations are so few and the perception they are received with so obscure and dull that it comes extremely short of the quickness and variety of sensation which is in other animals but yet it is sufficient for and wisely adapted to the state and condition of that sort of animals who are thus made so that the wisdom and goodness of the maker plainly appear in all the parts of this stupendous fabric and all the several degrees and ranks of creatures in it according to their condition we may i think from the make of an oyster or cockle reasonably conclude that it has not so many nor so quick senses as a man or several other animals nor if it had would it in that state and incapacity of transferring itself from one place to another be bettered by them what good would sight and hearing do to a creature that cannot move itself to or from the objects wherein at a distance it perceives good or evil and would not quickness of sensation be an inconvenience to an animal that must lie still where chance has once placed it and there receive the afflux of colder or warmer clean or foul water as it happens to come to it decay of perception in old age but yet i cannot but think there is some small dull perception whereby they are distinguished from perfect insensibility and that this may be so we have plain instances even in mankind itself take one in whom decrepit old age has blotted out the memory of his past knowledge and clearly wiped out the ideas his mind was formerly stored with and has by destroying his sight hearing and smell quite and his taste to a great degree stopped up almost all the passages for new ones to enter or if there be some of the inlets yet half open the impressions made are scarcely perceived or not at all retained how far such an one notwithstanding all that is boasted of innate principles is in his knowledge and intellectual faculties above the condition of a cockle or an oyster i leave to be considered and if a man had passed sixty years in such a state as it is possible he might as well as three days i wonder what difference there would be in any intellectual perfections between him and the lowest degree of animals perception the inlet of all materials of knowledge perception then being the first step and degree towards knowledge and the inlet of all the materials of it the fewer senses any man as well as any other creature hath and the fewer and duller the impressions are that are made by them and the duller the faculties are that are employed about themthe more remote are they from that knowledge which is to be found in some men but this being in great variety of degrees as may be perceived amongst men cannot certainly be discovered in the several species of animals much less in their particular individuals it suffices me only to have remarked herethat perception is the first operation of all our intellectual faculties and the inlet of all knowledge in our minds and i am apt too to imagine that it is perception in the lowest degree of it which puts the boundaries between animals and the inferior ranks of creatures but this i mention only as my conjecture by the by it being indifferent to the matter in hand which way the learned shall determine of it of retention contemplation the next faculty of the mind whereby it makes a further progress towards knowledge is that which i call retention or the keeping of those simple ideas which from sensation or reflection it hath received this is done two ways first by keeping the idea which is brought into it for some time actually in view which is called contemplation memory the other way of retention is the power to revive again in our minds those ideas which after im printing have disappeared or have been as it were laid aside out of sight and thus we do when we conceive heat or light yellow or sweetthe object being removed this is memory which is as it were the storehouse of our ideas for the narrow mind of man not being capable of having many ideas under view and consideration at once it was necessary to have a repository to lay up those ideas which at another time it might have use of but our ideas being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind which cease to be anything when there is no perception of them this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but thisthat the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has once had with this additional perception annexed to them that it has had them before and in this sense it is that our ideas are said to be in our memories when indeed they are actually nowherebut only there is an ability in the mind when it will to revive them again and as it were paint them anew on itself though some with more some with less difficulty some more lively and others more obscurely and thus it is by the assistance of this faculty that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings which though we do not actually contemplate yet we can bring in sight and make appear again and be the objects of our thoughts without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there attention repetition pleasure and pain fix ideas attention and repetition help much to the fixing any ideas in the memory but those which naturally at first make the deepest and most lasting impressions are those which are accompanied with pleasure or pain the great business of the senses being to make us take notice of what hurts or advantages the body it is wisely ordered by nature as has been shown that pain should accompany the reception of several ideas which supplying the place of consideration and reasoning in children and acting quicker than consideration in grown men makes both the old and young avoid painful objects with that haste which is necessary for their preservation and in both settles in the memory a caution for the future ideas fade in the memory concerning the several degrees of lasting wherewith ideas are imprinted on the memory we may observethat some of them have been produced in the understanding by an object affecting the senses once only and no more than once others that have more than once offered themselves to the senses have yet been little taken notice of the mind either heedless as in children or otherwise employed as in men intent only on one thing not setting the stamp deep into itself and in some where they are set on with care and repeated impressions either through the temper of the body or some other fault the memory is very weak in all these cases ideas in the mind quickly fade and often vanish quite out of the understanding leaving no more footsteps or remaining characters of themselves than shadows do flying over fields of corn and the mind is as void of them as if they had never been there causes of oblivion thus many of those ideas which were produced in the minds of children in the beginning of their sensation some of which perhaps as of some pleasures and pains were before they were born and others in their infancy if the future course of their lives they are not repeated again are quite lost without the least glimpse remaining of them this may be observed in those who by some mischance have lost their sight when they were very young in whom the ideas of colours having been but slightly taken notice of and ceasing to be repeated do quite wear out so that some years after there is no more notion nor memory of colours left in their minds than in those of people born blind the memory of some men it is true is very tenacious even to a miracle but yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas even of those which are struck deepest and in minds the most retentive so that if they be not sometimes renewed by repeated exercise of the senses or reflection on those kinds of objects which at first occasioned them the print wears out and at last there remains nothing to be seen thus the ideas as well as children of our youth often die before us and our minds represent to us those tombs to which we are approaching where though the brass and marble remain yet the inscriptions are effaced by time and the imagery moulders away the pictures drawn in our minds are laid in fading colours and if not sometimes refreshed vanish and disappear how much the constitution of our bodies and the make of our animal spirits are concerned in this and whether the temper of the brain makes this difference that in some it retains the characters drawn on it like marble in others like freestone and in others little better than sand i shall not here inquire though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory since we oftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas and the flames of a fever in a few days calcine all those images to dust and confusion which seemed to be as lasting as if graved in marble constantly repeated ideas can scarce be lost but concerning the ideas themselves it is easy to remark that those that are oftenest refreshed amongst which are those that are conveyed into the mind by more ways than one by a frequent return of the objects or actions that produce them fix themselves best in the memory and remain clearest and longest there and therefore those which are of the original qualities of bodies vis solidity extension figure motion and rest and those that almost constantly affect our bodies as heat and cold and those which are the affections of all kinds of beings as existence duration and number which almost every object that affects our senses every thought which employs our minds bring along with them these i say and the like ideas are seldom quite lost whilst the mind retains any ideas at all in remembering the mind is often active in this secondary perception as i may so call it or viewing again the ideas that are lodged in the memory the mind is oftentimes more than barely passive the appearance of those dormant pictures depending sometimes on the will the mind very often sets itself on work in search of some hidden idea and turns as it were the eye of the soul upon it though sometimes too they start up in our minds of their own accord and offer themselves to the understanding and very often are roused and tumbled out of their dark cells into open daylight by turbulent and tempestuous passions our affections bringing ideas to our memory which had otherwise lain quiet and unregarded this further is to be observed concerning ideas lodged in the memory and upon occasion revived by the mind that they are not only as the word revive imports none of them new ones but also that the mind takes notice of them as of a former impression and renews its acquaintance with them as with ideas it had known before so that though ideas formerly imprinted are not all constantly in view yet in remembrance they are constantly known to be such as have been formerly imprinted ie in view and taken notice of before by the understanding two defects in the memory oblivion and slowness memory in an intellectual creature is necessary in the next degree to perception it is of so great moment that where it is wanting all the rest of our faculties are in a great measure useless and we in our thoughts reasonings and knowledge could not proceed beyond present objects were it not for the assistance of our memories wherein there may be two defects first that it loses the idea quite and so far it produces perfect ignorance for since we can know nothing further than we have the idea of it when that is gone we are in perfect ignorance secondly that it moves slowly and retrieves not the ideas that it has and are laid up in store quick enough to serve the mind upon occasion this if it be to a great degree is stupidity and he who through this default in his memory has not the ideas that are really preserved there ready at hand when need and occasion calls for them were almost as good be without them quite since they serve him to little purpose the dull man who loses the opportunity whilst he is seeking in his mind for those ideas that should serve his turn is not much more happy in his knowledge than one that is perfectly ignorant it is the business therefore of the memory to furnish to the mind those dormant ideas which it has present occasion for in the having them ready at hand on all occasions consists that which we call invention fancy and quickness of parts a defect which belongs to the memory of man as finite these are defects we may observe in the memory of one man compared with another there is another defect which we may conceive to be in the memory of man in generalcompared with some superior created intellectual beings which in this faculty may so far excel man that they may have constantly in view the whole scene of all their former actions wherein no one of the thoughts they have ever had may slip out of their sight the omniscience of god who knows all things past present and to come and to whom the thoughts of mens hearts always lie open may satisfy us of the possibility of this for who can doubt but god may communicate to those glorious spirits his immediate attendants any of his perfections in what proportions he pleases as far as created finite beings can be capable it is reported of that prodigy of parts monsieur pascal that till the decay of his health had impaired his memory he forgot nothing of what he had done read or thought in any part of his rational age this is a privilege so little known to most men that it seems almost incredible to those who after the ordinary way measure all others by themselves but yet when considered may help us to enlarge our thoughts towards greater perfections of it in superior ranks of spirits for this of monsieur pascal was still with the narrowness that human minds are confined to hereof having great variety of ideas only by succession not all at once whereas the several degrees of angels may probably have larger views and some of them be endowed with capacities able to retain together and constantly set before them as in one picture all their past knowledge at once this we may conceive would be no small advantage to the knowledge of a thinking manif all his past thoughts and reasonings could be always present to him and therefore we may suppose it one of those ways wherein the knowledge of separate spirits may exceedingly surpass ours brutes have memory this faculty of laying up and retaining the ideas that are brought into the mind several other animals seem to have to a great degree as well as man for to pass by other instances birds learning of tunes and the endeavours one may observe in them to hit the notes right put it past doubt with me that they have perception and retain ideas in their memories and use them for patterns for it seems to me impossible that they should endeavour to conform their voices to notes as it is plain they do of which they had no ideas for though i should grant sound may mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal spirits in the brains of those birds whilst the tune is actually playing and that motion may be continued on to the muscles of the wings and so the bird mechanically be driven away by certain noises because this may tend to the birds preservation yet that can never be supposed a reason why it should cause mechanicallyeither whilst the tune is playing much less after it has ceasedsuch a motion of the organs in the birds voice as should conform it to the notes of a foreign sound which imitation can be of no use to the birds preservation but which is more it cannot with any appearance of reason be supposed much less proved that birds without sense and memory can approach their notes nearer and nearer by degrees to a tune played yesterday which if they have no idea of in their memory is now nowhere nor can be a pattern for them to imitate or which any repeated essays can bring them nearer to since there is no reason why the sound of a pipe should leave traces in their brains which not at first but by their afterendeavours should produce the like sounds and why the sounds they make themselves should not make traces which they should follow as well as those of the pipe is impossible to conceive of discerning and other operations of the mind no knowledge without discernment another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of discerning and distinguishing between the several ideas it has it is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities it would be capable of very little knowledge though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now and the mind were continually employed in thinking on this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several even very general propositions which have passed for innate truthsbecause men overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent impute it wholly to native uniform impressions whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind whereby it perceives two ideas to be the same or different but of this more hereafter the difference of wit and judgment how much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense or want of acuteness exercise or attention in the understanding or hastiness and precipitancy natural to some tempers i will not here examine it suffices to take notice that this is one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself it is of that consequence to its other knowledge that so far as this faculty is in itself dull or not rightly made use of for the distinguishing one thing from anotherso far our notions are confused and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled if in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts in this of having them unconfused and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another where there is but the least difference consists in a great measure the exactness of judgment and clearness of reason which is to be observed in one man above another and hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observationthat men who have a great deal of wit and prompt memories have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason for wit lying most in the assemblage of ideas and putting those together with quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy judgment on the contrary lies quite on the other side in separating carefully one from another ideas wherein can be found the least difference thereby to avoid being misled by similitude and by affinity to take one thing for another this is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit which strikes so lively on the fancy and therefore is so acceptable to all people because its beauty appears at first sight and there is required no labor of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it the mind without looking any further rests satisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy and it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it by the severe rules of truth and good reason whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them clearness done hinders confusion to the well distinguishing our ideas it chiefly contributes that they be clear and determinate and when they are so it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them though the senses should as sometimes they do convey them from the same object differently on different occasions and so seem to err for though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste which at another time would produce a sweet one yet the idea of bitter in that mans mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one and at another time another idea by the taste than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet or white and round that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time and the ideas of orangecolour and azure that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephriticum are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies comparing the comparing them one with another in respect of extent degrees time place or any other circumstances is another operation of the mind about its ideas and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of ideas comprehended under relation which of how vast an extent it is i shall have occasion to consider hereafter brutes compare but imperfectly how far brutes partake in this faculty is not easy to determine i imagine they have it not in any great degree for though they probably have several ideas distinct enough yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding when it has sufficiently distinguished any ideas so as to perceive them to be perfectly different and so consequently two to cast about and consider in what circumstances they are capable to be compared and therefore i think beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves the other power of comparing which may be observed in men belonging to general ideas and useful only to abstract reasonings we may probably conjecture beasts have not compounding the next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas is composition whereby it puts together several of those simple ones it has received from sensation and reflection and combines them into complex ones under this of composition may be reckoned also that of enlarging wherein though the composition does not so much appear as in more complex ones yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas together though of the same kind thus by adding several units together we make the idea of a dozen and putting together the repeated ideas of several perches we frame that of a furlong brutes compound but little in this also i suppose brutes come far short of man for though they take in and retain together several combinations of simple ideas as possibly the shape smell and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him yet i do not think they do of themselves ever compound them and make complex ideas and perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas it is only one simple one that directs them in the knowledge of several things which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine for i have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse play with and be fond of young foxes as much as and in place of her puppies if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them and those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once appear not to have any knowledge of their number for though they are mightily concerned for any of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or hearing yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their absence or without noise they appear not to miss them or to have any sense that their number is lessened naming when children have by repeated sensations got ideas fixed in their memories they begin by degrees to learn the use of signs and when they have got the skill to apply the organs of speech to the framing of articulate sounds they begin to make use of words to signify their ideas to others these verbal signs they sometimes borrow from others and sometimes make themselves as one may observe among the new and unusual names children often give to things in the first use of language abstraction the use of words then being to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas and those ideas being taken from particular things if every particular idea that we take in should have a distinct name names must be endless to prevent this the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearancesseparate from all other existences and the circumstances of real existence as time place or any other concomitant ideas this is called abstraction whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind and their names general names applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas such precise naked appearances in the mind without considering how whence or with what others they came there the understanding lays up with names commonly annexed to them as the standards to rank real existences into sorts as they agree with these patterns and to denominate them accordingly thus the same colour being observed today in chalk or snow which the mind yesterday received from milk it considers that appearance alone makes it a representative of all of that kind and having given it the name whiteness it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with and thus universals whether ideas or terms are made brutes abstract not if it may be doubted whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to any degree this i think i may be positive inthat the power of abstracting is not at all in them and that the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to for it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting or making general ideas since they have no use of words or any other general signs brutes abstract not yet are not bare machines nor can it be imputed to their want of fit organs to frame articulate sounds that they have no use or knowledge of general words since many of them we find can fashion such sounds and pronounce words distinctly enough but never with any such application and on the other side men who through some defect in the organs want words yet fail not to express their universal ideas by signs which serve them instead of general words a faculty which we see beasts come short in and therefore i think we may suppose that it is in this that the species of brutes are discriminated from man and it is that proper difference wherein they are wholly separated and which at last widens to so vast a distance for if they have any ideas at all and are not bare machines as some would have them we cannot deny them to have some reason it seems as evident to me that they do some of them in certain instances reason as that they have sense but it is only in particular ideas just as they received them from their senses they are the best of them tied up within those narrow bounds and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction idiots and madmen how far idiots are concerned in the want or weakness of any or all of the foregoing faculties an exact observation of their several ways of faultering would no doubt discover for those who either perceive but dully or retain the ideas that come into their minds but ill who cannot readily excite or compound them will have little matter to think on those who cannot distinguish compare and abstract would hardly be able to understand and make use of language or judge or reason to any tolerable degree but only a little and imperfectly about things present and very familiar to their senses and indeed any of the forementioned faculties if wanting or out of order produce suitable defects in mens understandings and knowledge difference between idiots and madmen in fine the defect in naturals seems to proceed from want of quickness activity and motion in the intellectual faculties whereby they are deprived of reason whereas madmen on the other side seem to suffer by the other extreme for they do not appear to me to have lost the faculty of reasoning but having joined together some ideas very wrongly they mistake them for truths and they err as men do that argue right from wrong principles for by the violence of their imaginations having taken their fancies for realities they make right deductions from them thus you shall find a distracted man fancying himself a king with a right inference require suitable attendance respect and obedience others who have thought themselves made of glass have used the caution necessary to preserve such brittle bodies hence it comes to pass that a man who is very sober and of a right understanding in all other things may in one particular be as frantic as any in bedlam if either by any sudden very strong impression or long fixing his fancy upon one sort of thoughts incoherent ideas have been cemented together so powerfully as to remain united but there are degrees of madness as of folly the disorderly jumbling ideas together is in some more and some less in short herein seems to lie the difference between idiots and madmen that madmen put wrong ideas together and so make wrong propositions but argue and reason right from them but idiots make very few or no propositions and reason scarce at all method followed in this explication of faculties these i think are the first faculties and operations of the mind which it makes use of in understanding and though they are exercised about all its ideas in general yet the instances i have hitherto given have been chiefly in simple ideas and i have subjoined the explication of these faculties of the mind to that of simple ideas before i come to what i have to say concerning complex ones for these following reasons first because several of these faculties being exercised at first principally about simple ideas we might by following nature in its ordinary method trace and discover them in their rise progress and gradual improvements secondly because observing the faculties of the mind how they operate about simple ideaswhich are usually in most mens minds much more clear precise and distinct than complex oneswe may the better examine and learn how the mind extracts denominates compares and exercises in its other operations about those which are complex wherein we are much more liable to mistake thirdly because these very operations of the mind about ideas received from sensations are themselves when reflected on another set of ideas derived from that other source of our knowledge which i call reflection and therefore fit to be considered in this place after the simple ideas of sensation of compounding comparing abstracting c i have but just spoken having occasion to treat of them more at large in other places the true beginning of human knowledge and thus i have given a short and i think true history of the first beginnings of human knowledgewhence the mind has its first objects and by what steps it makes its progress to the laying in and storing up those ideas out of which is to be framed all the knowledge it is capable of wherein i must appeal to experience and observation whether i am in the right the best way to come to truth being to examine things as really they are and not to conclude they are as we fancy of ourselves or have been taught by others to imagine appeal to experience to deal truly this is the only way that i can discover whereby the ideas of things are brought into the understanding if other men have either innate ideas or infused principles they have reason to enjoy them and if they are sure of it it is impossible for others to deny them the privilege that they have above their neighbours i can speak but of what i find in myself and is agreeable to those notions which if we will examine the whole course of men in their several ages countries and educations seem to depend on those foundations which i have laid and to correspond with this method in all the parts and degrees thereof dark room i pretend not to teach but to inquire and therefore cannot but confess here againthat external and internal sensation are the only passages i can find of knowledge to the understanding these alone as far as i can discover are the windows by which light is let into this dark room for methinks the understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light with only some little openings left to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things without would the pictures coming into such a dark room but stay there and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all objects of sight and the ideas of them these are my guesses concerning the means whereby the understanding comes to have and retain simple ideas and the modes of them with some other operations about them i proceed now to examine some of these simple ideas and their modes a little more particularly of complex ideas made by the mind out of simple ones we have hitherto considered those ideas in the reception whereof the mind is only passive which are those simple ones received from sensation and reflection before mentioned whereof the mind cannot make one to itself nor have any idea which does not wholly consist of them but as the mind is wholly passive in the reception of all its simple ideas so it exerts several acts of its own whereby out of its simple ideas as the materials and foundations of the rest the others are framed the acts of the mind wherein it exerts its power over its simple ideas are chiefly these three combining several simple ideas into one compound one and thus all complex ideas are made the second is bringing two ideas whether simple or complex together and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once without uniting them into one by which way it gets all its ideas of relations the third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence this is called abstraction and thus all its general ideas are made this shows mans power and its ways of operation to be much the same in the material and intellectual world for the materials in both being such as he has no power over either to make or destroy all that man can do is either to unite them together or to set them by one another or wholly separate them i shall here begin with the first of these in the consideration of complex ideas and come to the other two in their due places as simple ideas are observed to exist in several combinations united together so the mind has a power to consider several of them united together as one idea and that not only as they are united in external objects but as itself has joined them together ideas thus made up of several simple ones put together i call complexsuch as are beauty gratitude a man an army the universe which though complicated of various simple ideas or complex ideas made up of simple ones yet are when the mind pleases considered each by itself as one entire thing and signified by one name made voluntarily in this faculty of repeating and joining together its ideas the mind has great power in varying and multiplying the objects of its thoughts infinitely beyond what sensation or reflection furnished it with but all this still confined to those simple ideas which it received from those two sources and which are the ultimate materials of all its compositions for simple ideas are all from things themselves and of these the mind can have no more nor other than what are suggested to it it can have no other ideas of sensible qualities than what come from without by the senses nor any ideas of other kind of operations of a thinking substance than what it finds in itself but when it has once got these simple ideas it is not confined barely to observation and what offers itself from without it can by its own power put together those ideas it has and make new complex ones which it never received so united complex ideas are either of modes substances or relations complex ideas however compounded and decompounded though their number be infinite and the variety endless wherewith they fill and entertain the thoughts of men yet i think they may be all reduced under these three heads modes substances relations ideas of modes first modes i call such complex ideas which however compounded contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves but are considered as dependences on or affections of substances such as are the ideas signified by the words triangle gratitude murder c and if in this i use the word mode in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification i beg pardon it being unavoidable in discourses differing from the ordinary received notions either to make new words or to use old words in somewhat a new signification the later whereof in our present case is perhaps the more tolerable of the two simple and mixed modes of simple ideas of these modes there are two sorts which deserve distinct consideration first there are some which are only variations or different combinations of the same simple idea without the mixture of any otheras a dozen or score which are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units added together and these i call simple modes as being contained within the bounds of one simple idea secondly there are others compounded of simple ideas of several kinds put together to make one complex onevg beauty consisting of a certain composition of colour and figure causing delight to the beholder theft which being the concealed change of the possession of anything without the consent of the propri etor contains as is visible a combination of several ideas of several kinds and these i call mixed modes ideas of substances single or collective secondly the ideas of substances are such combinations of simple ideas as are taken to represent distinct particular things subsisting by themselves the supposed or confused idea of substance such as it is is always the first and chief thus if to substance be joined the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour with certain degrees of weight hardness ductility and fusibility we have the idea of lead and a combination of the ideas of a certain sort of figure with the powers of motion thought and reasoning joined to substance the ordinary idea of a man now of substances also there are two sorts of ideas one of single substances as they exist separately as of a man or a sheep the other of several of those put together as an army of men or flock of sheepwhich collective ideas of several substances thus put together are as much each of them one single idea as that of a man or an unit ideas of relation thirdly the last sort of complex ideas is that we call relation which consists in the consideration and comparing one idea with another of these several kinds we shall treat in their order the abstrusest ideas we can have are all from two sources if we trace the progress of our minds and with attention observe how it repeats adds together and unites its simple ideas received from sensation or reflection it will lead us further than at first perhaps we should have imagined and i believe we shall find if we warily observe the originals of our notions that even the most abstruse ideas how remote soever they may seem from sense or from any operations of our own minds are yet only such as the understanding frames to itself by repeating and joining together ideas that it had either from objects of sense or from its own operations about them so that those even large and abstract ideas are derived from sensation or reflection being no other than what the mind by the ordinary use of its own faculties employed about ideas received from objects of sense or from the operations it observes in itself about them may and does attain unto this i shall endeavour to show in the ideas we have of space time and infinity and some few others that seem the most remote from those originals complex ideas of simple modes and first of the simple modes of the idea of space simple modes of simple ideas though in the foregoing part i have often mentioned simple ideas which are truly the materials of all our knowledge yet having treated of them there rather in the way that they come into the mind than as distinguished from others more compounded it will not be perhaps amiss to take a view of some of them again under this consideration and examine those different modifications of the same idea which the mind either finds in things existing or is able to make within itself without the help of any extrinsical object or any foreign suggestion those modifications of any one simple idea which as has been said i call simple modes are as perfectly different and distinct ideas in the mind as those of the greatest distance or contrariety for the idea of two is as distinct from that of one as blueness from heat or either of them from any number and yet it is made up only of that simple idea of an unit repeated and repetitions of this kind joined together make those distinct simple modes of a dozen a gross a million idea of space i shall begin with the simple idea of space i have showed above chap v that we get the idea of space both by our sight and touch which i think is so evident that it would be as needless to go to prove that men perceive by their sight a distance between bodies of different colours or between the parts of the same body as that they see colours themselves nor is it less obvious that they can do so in the dark by feeling and touch space and extension this space considered barely in length between any two beings without considering anything else between them is called distance if considered in length breadth and thickness i think it may be called capacity the term extension is usually applied to it in what manner soever considered immensity each different distance is a different modification of space and each idea of any different distance or space is a simple mode of this idea men for the use and by the custom of measuring settle in their minds the ideas of certain stated lengthssuch as are an inch foot yard fathom mile diameter of the earth c which are so many distinct ideas made up only of space when any such stated lengths or measures of space are made familiar to mens thoughts they can in their minds repeat them as often as they will without mixing or joining to them the idea of body or anything else and frame to themselves the ideas of long square or cubic feet yards or fathoms here amongst the bodies of the universe or else beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies and by adding these still one to another enlarge their ideas of space as much as they please the power of repeating or doubling any idea we have of any distance and adding it to the former as often as we will without being ever able to come to any stop or stint let us enlarge it as much as we will is that which gives us the idea of immensity figure there is another modification of this idea which is nothing but the relation which the parts of the termination of extension or circumscribed space have amongst themselves this the touch discovers in sensible bodies whose extremities come within our reach and the eye takes both from bodies and colours whose boundaries are within its view where observing how the extremities terminateeither in straight lines which meet at discernible angles or in crooked lines wherein no angles can be perceived by considering these as they relate to one another in all parts of the extremities of any body or space it has that idea we call figure which affords to the mind infinite variety for besides the vast number of different figures that do really exist in the coherent masses of matter the stock that the mind has in its power by varying the idea of space and thereby making still new compositions by repeating its own ideas and joining them as it pleases is perfectly inexhaustible and so it can multiply figures in infinitum endless variety of figures for the mind having a power to repeat the idea of any length directly stretched out and join it to another in the same direction which is to double the length of that straight line or else join another with what inclination it thinks fit and so make what sort of angle it pleases and being able also to shorten any line it imagines by taking from it one half one fourth or what part it pleases without being able to come to an end of any such divisions it can make an angle of any bigness so also the lines that are its sides of what length it pleases which joining again to other lines of different lengths and at different angles till it has wholly enclosed any space it is evident that it can multiply figures both in their shape and capacity in infinitum all which are but so many different simple modes of space the same that it can do with straight lines it can also do with crooked or crooked and straight together and the same it can do in lines it can also in superficies by which we may be led into farther thoughts of the endless variety of figures that the mind has a power to make and thereby to multiply the simple modes of space place another idea coming under this head and belonging to this tribe is that we call place as in simple space we consider the relation of distance between any two bodies or points so in our idea of place we consider the relation of distance betwixt anything and any two or more points which are considered as keeping the same distance one with another and so considered as at rest for when we find anything at the same distance now which it was yesterday from any two or more points which have not since changed their distance one with another and with which we then compared it we say it hath kept the same place but if it hath sensibly altered its distance with either of those points we say it hath changed its place though vulgarly speaking in the common notion of place we do not always exactly observe the distance from these precise points but from larger portions of sensible objects to which we consider the thing placed to bear relation and its distance from which we have some reason to observe place relative to particular bodies thus a company of chessmen standing on the same squares of the chess board where we left them we say they are all in the same place or unmoved though perhaps the chessboard hath been in the mean time carried out of one room into another because we compared them only to the parts of the chessboard which keep the same distance one with another the chessboard we also say is in the same place it was if it remain in the same part of the cabin though perhaps the ship which it is in sails all the while and the ship is said to be in the same place supposing it kept the same distance with the parts of the neighbouring land though perhaps the earth hath turned round and so both chessmen and board and ship have every one changed place in respect of remoter bodies which have kept the same distance one with another but yet the distance from certain parts of the board being that which determines the place of the chessmen and the distance from the fixed parts of the cabin with which we made the comparison being that which determined the place of the chessboard and the fixed parts of the earth that by which we determined the place of the shipthese things may be said to be in the same place in those respects though their distance from some other things which in this matter we did not consider being varied they have undoubtedly changed place in that respect and we ourselves shall think so when we have occasion to compare them with those other place relative to a present purpose but this modification of distance we call place being made by men for their common use that by it they might be able to design the particular position of things where they had occasion for such designation men consider and determine of this place by reference to those adjacent things which best served to their present purpose without considering other things which to another purpose would better determine the place of the same thing thus in the chessboard the use of the designation of the place of each chessman being determined only within that chequered piece of wood it would cross that purpose to measure it by anything else but when these very chessmen are put up in a bag if any one should ask where the black king is it would be proper to determine the place by the part of the room it was in and not by the chessboard there being another use of designing the place it is now in than when in play it was on the chessboard and so must be determined by other bodies so if any one should ask in what place are the verses which report the story of nisus and euryalus it would be very improper to determine this place by saying they were in such a part of the earth or in bodleys library but the right designation of the place would be by the parts of virgils works and the proper answer would be that these verses were about the middle of the ninth book of his aeneids and that they have been always constantly in the same place ever since virgil was printed which is true though the book itself hath moved a thousand times the use of the idea of place here being to know in what part of the book that story is that so upon occasion we may know where to find it and have recourse to it for use place of the universe that our idea of place is nothing else but such a relative position of anything as i have before mentioned i think is plain and will be easily admitted when we consider that we can have no idea of the place of the universe though we can of all the parts of it because beyond that we have not the idea of any fixed distinct particular beings in reference to which we can imagine it to have any relation of distance but all beyond it is one uniform space or expansion wherein the mind finds no variety no marks for to say that the world is somewhere means no more than that it does exist this though a phrase borrowed from place signifying only its existence not location and when one can find out and frame in his mind clearly and distinctly the place of the universe he will be able to tell us whether it moves or stands still in the undistinguishable inane of infinite space though it be true that the word place has sometimes a more confused sense and stands for that space which anybody takes up and so the universe is in a place the idea therefore of place we have by the same means that we get the idea of space whereof this is but a particular limited consideration viz by our sight and touch by either of which we receive into our minds the ideas of extension or distance extension and body not the same there are some that would persuade us that body and extension are the same thing who either change the signification of words which i would not suspect them ofthey having so severely condemned the philosophy of others because it hath been too much placed in the uncertain meaning or deceitful obscurity of doubtful or insignificant terms if therefore they mean by body and extension the same that other people do viz by body something that is solid and extended whose parts are separable and movable different ways and by extension only the space that lies between the extremities of those solid coherent parts and which is possessed by themthey confound very different ideas one with another for i appeal to every mans own thoughts whether the idea of space be not as distinct from that of solidity as it is from the idea of scarlet colour it is true solidity cannot exist without extension neither can scarlet colour exist without extension but this hinders not but that they are distinct ideas many ideas require others as necessary to their existence or conception which yet are very distinct ideas motion can neither be nor be conceived without space and yet motion is not space nor space motion space can exist without it and they are very distinct ideas and so i think are those of space and solidity solidity is so inseparable an idea from body that upon that depends its filling of space its contact impulse and communication of motion upon impulse and if it be a reason to prove that spirit is different from body because thinking includes not the idea of extension in it the same reason will be as valid i suppose to prove that space is not body because it includes not the idea of solidity in it space and solidity being as distinct ideas as thinking and extension and as wholly separable in the mind one from another body then and extension it is evident are two distinct ideas for extension not solidity first extension includes no solidity nor resistance to the motion of body as body does the parts of space inseparable both really and mentally secondly the parts of pure space are inseparable one from the other so that the continuity cannot be separated neither really nor mentally for i demand of any one to remove any part of it from another with which it is continued even so much as in thought to divide and separate actually is as i think by removing the parts one from another to make two superficies where before there was a continuity and to divide mentally is to make in the mind two superficies where before there was a continuity and consider them as removed one from the other which can only be done in things considered by the mind as capable of being separated and by separation of acquiring new distinct superficies which they then have not but are capable of but neither of these ways of separation whether real or mental is as i think compatible to pure space it is true a man may consider so much of such a space as is answerable or commensurate to a foot with out considering the rest which is indeed a partial consideration but not so much as mental separation or division since a man can no more mentally divide without considering two superficies separate one from the other than he can actually divide without making two superficies disjoined one from the other but a partial consideration is not separating a man may consider light in the sun without its heat or mobility in body without its extension without thinking of their separation one is only a partial consideration terminating in one alone and the other is a consideration of both as existing separately the parts of space immovable thirdly the parts of pure space are immovable which follows from their inseparability motion being nothing but change of distance between any two things but this cannot be between parts that are inseparable which therefore must needs be at perpetual rest one amongst another thus the determined idea of simple space distinguishes it plainly and sufficiently from body since its parts are inseparable immovable and without resistance to the motion of body the definition of extension explains it not if any one ask me what this space i speak of is i will tell him when he tells me what his extension is for to say as is usually done that extension is to have partes extra partes is to say only that extension is extension for what am i the better informed in the nature of extension when i am told that extension is to have parts that are extended exterior to parts that are extended ie extension consists of extended parts as if one asking what a fibre was i should answer himthat it was a thing made up of several fibres would he thereby be enabled to understand what a fibre was better than he did before or rather would he not have reason to think that my design was to make sport with him rather than seriously to instruct him division of beings into bodies and spirits proves not space and body the same those who contend that space and body are the same bring this dilemmaeither this space is something or nothing if nothing be between two bodies they must necessarily touch if it be allowed to be something they ask whether it be body or spirit to which i answer by another question who told them that there was or could be nothing but solid beings which could not think and thinking beings that were not extendedwhich is all they mean by the terms body and spirit substance which we know not no proof against space without body if it be demanded as usually it is whether this space void of body be substance or accident i shall readily answer i know not nor shall be ashamed to own my ignorance till they that ask show me a clear distinct idea of substance different meanings of substance i endeavour as much as i can to deliver myself from those fallacies which we are apt to put upon ourselves by taking words for things it helps not our ignorance to feign a knowledge where we have none by making a noise with sounds without clear and distinct significations names made at pleasure neither alter the nature of things nor make us understand them but as they are signs of and stand for determined ideas and i desire those who lay so much stress on the sound of these two syllables substance to consider whether applying it as they do to the infinite incomprehensible god to finite spirits and to body it be in the same sense and whether it stands for the same idea when each of those three so different beings are called substances if so whether it will thence followthat god spirits and body agreeing in the same common nature of substance differ not any otherwise than in a bare different modification of that substance as a tree and a pebble being in the same sense body and agreeing in the common nature of body differ only in a bare modification of that common matter which will be a very harsh doctrine if they say that they apply it to god finite spirit and matter in three different significations and that it stands for one idea when god is said to be a substance for another when the soul is called substance and for a third when body is called soif the name substance stands for three several distinct ideas they would do well to make known those distinct ideas or at least to give three distinct names to them to prevent in so important a notion the confusion and errors that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of so doubtful a term which is so far from being suspected to have three distinct that in ordinary use it has scarce one clear distinct signification and if they can thus make three distinct ideas of substance what hinders why another may not make a fourth substance and accidents of little use in philosophy they who first ran into the notion of accidents as a sort of real beings that needed something to inhere in were forced to find out the word substance to support them had the poor indian philosopher who imagined that the earth also wanted something to bear it up but thought of this word substance he needed not to have been at the trouble to find an elephant to support it and a tortoise to support his elephant the word substance would have done it effectually and he that inquired might have taken it for as good an answer from an indian philosopherthat substance without knowing what it is is that which supports the earth as we take it for a sufficient answer and good doctrine from our european philosophersthat substance without knowing what it is is that which supports accidents so that of substance we have no idea of what it is but only a confused obscure one of what it does sticking on and underpropping whatever a learned man may do here an intelligent american who inquired into the nature of things would scarce take it for a satisfactory account if desiring to learn our architecture he should be told that a pillar is a thing supported by a basis and a basis something that supported a pillar would he not think himself mocked instead of taught with such an account as this and a stranger to them would be very liberally instructed in the nature of books and the things they contained if he should be told that all learned books consisted of paper and letters and that letters were things inhering in paper and paper a thing that held forth letters a notable way of having clear ideas of letters and paper but were the latin words inhaerentia and substantio put into the plain english ones that answer them and were called sticking on and underpropping they would better discover to us the very great clearness there is in the doctrine of substance and accidents and show of what use they are in deciding of questions in philosophy a vacuum beyond the utmost bounds of body but to return to our idea of space if body be not supposed infinite which i think no one will affirm i would ask whether if god placed a man at the extremity of corporeal beings he could not stretch his hand beyond his body if he could then he would put his arm where there was before space without body and if there he spread his fingers there would still be space between them without body if he could not stretch out his hand it must be because of some external hindrance for we suppose him alive with such a power of moving the parts of his body that he hath now which is not in itself impossible if god so pleased to have it or at least it is not impossible for god so to move him and then i askwhether that which hinders his hand from moving outwards be substance or accident something or nothing and when they have resolved that they will be able to resolve themselveswhat that is which is or may be between two bodies at a distance that is not body and has no solidity in the mean time the argument is at least as good that where nothing hinders as beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies a body put in motion may move on as where there is nothing be tween there two bodies must necessarily touch for pure space between is sufficient to take away the necessity of mutual contact but bare space in the way is not sufficient to stop motion the truth is these men must either own that they think body infinite though they are loth to speak it out or else affirm that space is not body for i would fain meet with that thinking man that can in his thoughts set any bounds to space more than he can to duration or by thinking hope to arrive at the end of either and therefore if his idea of eternity be infinite so is his idea of immensity they are both finite or infinite alike the power of annihilation proves a vacuum farther those who assert the impossibility of space existing without matter must not only make body infinite but must also deny a power in god to annihilate any part of matter no one i suppose will deny that god can put an end to all motion that is in matter and fix all the bodies of the universe in a perfect quiet and rest and continue them so long as he pleases whoever then will allow that god can during such a general rest annihilate either this book or the body of him that reads it must necessarily admit the possibility of a vacuum for it is evident that the space that was filled by the parts of the annihilated body will still remain and be a space without body for the circumambient bodies being in perfect rest are a wall of adamant and in that state make it a perfect impossibility for any other body to get into that space and indeed the necessary motion of one particle of matter into the place from whence another particle of matter is removed is but a consequence from the supposition of plenitude which will therefore need some better proof than a supposed matter of fact which experiment can never make out our own clear and distinct ideas plainly satisfying us that there is no necessary connexion between space and solidity since we can conceive the one without the other and those who dispute for or against a vacuum do thereby confess they have distinct ideas of vacuum and plenum ie that they have an idea of extension void of solidity though they deny its existence or else they dispute about nothing at all for they who so much alter the signification of words as to call extension body and consequently make the whole essence of body to be nothing but pure extension without solidity must talk absurdly whenever they speak of vacuum since it is impossible for extension to be without extension for vacuum whether we affirm or deny its existence signifies space without body whose very existence no one can deny to be possible who will not make matter infinite and take from god a power to annihilate any particle of it motion proves a vacuum but not to go so far as beyond the utmost bounds of body in the universe nor appeal to gods omnipotency to find a vacuum the motion of bodies that are in our view and neighbourhood seems to me plainly to evince it for i desire any one so to divide a solid body of any dimension he pleases as to make it possible for the solid parts to move up and down freely every way within the bounds of that superficies if there be not left in it a void space as big as the least part into which he has divided the said solid body and if where the least particle of the body divided is as big as a mustardseed a void space equal to the bulk of a mustardseed be requisite to make room for the free motion of the parts of the divided body within the bounds of its superficies where the particles of matter are less than a mustardseed there must also be a space void of solid matter as big as part of a mustardseed for if it hold in the one it will hold in the other and so on in infinitum and let this void space be as little as it will it destroys the hypothesis of plenitude for if there can be a space void of body equal to the smallest separate particle of matter now existing in nature it is still space without body and makes as great a difference between space and body as if it were mega chasma a distance as wide as any in nature and therefore if we suppose not the void space necessary to motion equal to the least parcel of the divided solid matter but to or of it the same consequence will always follow of space without matter the ideas of space and body distinct but the question being herewhether the idea of space or exten sion be the same with the idea of body it is not necessary to prove the real existence of a vacuum but the idea of it which it is plain men have when they inquire and dispute whether there be a vacuum or no for if they had not the idea of space without body they could not make a question about its existence and if their idea of body did not include in it something more than the bare idea of space they could have no doubt about the plenitude of the world and it would be as absurd to demand whether there were space without body as whether there were space without space or body without body since these were but different names of the same idea extension being inseparable from body proves it not the same it is true the idea of extension joins itself so inseparably with all visible and most tangible qualities that it suffers us to see no one or feel very few external objects without taking in impressions of extension too this readiness of extension to make itself be taken notice of so constantly with other ideas has been the occasion i guess that some have made the whole essence of body to consist in extension which is not much to be wondered at since some have had their minds by their eyes and touch the busiest of all our senses so filled with the idea of extension and as it were wholly possessed with it that they allowed no existence to anything that had not extension i shall not now argue with those men who take the measure and possibility of all being only from their narrow and gross imaginations but having here to do only with those who conclude the essence of body to be extension because they say they cannot imagine any sensible quality of any body without extensioni shall desire them to consider that had they reflected on their ideas of tastes and smells as much as on those of sight and touch nay had they examined their ideas of hunger and thirst and several other pains they would have found that they included in them no idea of extension at all which is but an affection of body as well as the rest discoverable by our senses which are scarce acute enough to look into the pure essences of things essences of things if those ideas which are con stantly joined to all others must therefore be concluded to be the essence of those things which have constantly those ideas joined to them and are inseparable from them then unity is without doubt the essence of everything for there is not any object of sensation or reflection which does not carry with it the idea of one but the weakness of this kind of argument we have already shown sufficiently ideas of space and solidity distinct to conclude whatever men shall think concerning the existence of a vacuum this is plain to methat we have as clear an idea of space distinct from solidity as we have of solidity distinct from motion or motion from space we have not any two more distinct ideas and we can as easily conceive space without solidity as we can conceive body or space without motion though it be never so certain that neither body nor motion can exist without space but whether any one will take space to be only a relation resulting from the existence of other beings at a distance or whether they will think the words of the most knowing king solomon the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee or those more emphatical ones of the inspired philosopher st paul in him we live move and have our being are to be understood in a literal sense i leave every one to consider only our idea of space is i think such as i have mentioned and distinct from that of body for whether we consider in matter itself the distance of its coherent solid parts and call it in respect of those solid parts extension or whether considering it as lying between the extremities of any body in its several dimensions we call it length breadth and thickness or else considering it as lying between any two bodies or positive beings without any consideration whether there be any matter or not between we call it distancehowever named or considered it is always the same uniform simple idea of space taken from objects about which our senses have been conversant whereof having settled ideas in our minds we can revive repeat and add them one to another as often as we will and consider the space or distance so imagined either as filled with solid parts so that another body cannot come there without displac ing and thrusting out the body that was there before or else as void of solidity so that a body of equal dimensions to that empty or pure space may be placed in it without the removing or expulsion of anything that was there but to avoid confusion in discourses concerning this matter it were possibly to be wished that the name extension were applied only to matter or the distance of the extremities of particular bodies and the term expansion to space in general with or without solid matter possessing itso as to say space is expanded and body extended but in this every one has his liberty i propose it only for the more clear and distinct way of speaking men differ little in clear simple ideas the knowing precisely what our words stand for would i imagine in this as well as a great many other cases quickly end the dispute for i am apt to think that men when they come to examine them find their simple ideas all generally to agree though in discourse with one another they perhaps confound one another with different names i imagine that men who abstract their thoughts and do well examine the ideas of their own minds cannot much differ in thinking however they may perplex themselves with words according to the way of speaking to the several schools or sects they have been bred up in though amongst unthinking men who examine not scrupulously and carefully their own ideas and strip them not from the marks men use for them but confound them with words there must be endless dispute wrangling and jargon especially if they be learned bookish men devoted to some sect and accustomed to the language of it and have learned to talk after others but if it should happen that any two thinking men should really have different ideas i do not see how they could discourse or argue with another here i must not be mistaken to think that every floating imagination in mens brains is presently of that sort of ideas i speak of it is not easy for the mind to put off those confused notions and prejudices it has imbibed from custom inadvertency and common conversation it requires pains and assiduity to examine its ideas till it resolves them into those clear and distinct simple ones out of which they are compounded and to see which amongst its simple ones have or have not a necessary connexion and dependence one upon another till a man doth this in the primary and original notions of things he builds upon floating and uncertain principles and will often find himself at a loss idea of duration and its simple modes duration is fleeting extension there is another sort of distance or length the idea whereof we get not from the permanent parts of space but from the fleeting and perpetually perishing parts of succession this we call duration the simple modes whereof are any different lengths of it whereof we have distinct ideas as hours days years c time and eternity its idea from reflection on the train of our ideas the answer of a great man to one who asked what time was si non rogas intelligo which amounts to this the more i set myself to think of it the less i understand it might perhaps persuade one that time which reveals all other things is itself not to be discovered duration time and eternity are not without reason thought to have something very abstruse in their nature but however remote these may seem from our comprehension yet if we trace them right to their originals i doubt not but one of those sources of all our knowledge viz sensation and reflection will be able to furnish us with these ideas as clear and distinct as many others which are thought much less obscure and we shall find that the idea of eternity itself is derived from the same common original with the rest of our ideas nature and origin of the idea of duration to understand time and eternity aright we ought with attention to consider what idea it is we have of duration and how we came by it it is evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own mind that there is a train of ideas which constantly succeed one another in his understanding as long as he is awake reflection on these appearances of several ideas one after another in our minds is that which furnishes us with the idea of succession and the distance between any parts of that succession or between the appearance of any two ideas in our minds is that we call duration for whilst we are thinking or whilst we receive successively several ideas in our minds we know that we do exist and so we call the existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves or anything else commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds the duration of ourselves or any such other thing coexistent with our thinking proof that its idea is got from reflection on the train of our ideas that we have our notion of succession and duration from this original viz from reflection on the train of ideas which we find to appear one after another in our own minds seems plain to me in that we have no perception of duration but by considering the train of ideas that take their turns in our understandings when that succession of ideas ceases our perception of duration ceases with it which every one clearly experiments in himself whilst he sleeps soundly whether an hour or a day a month or a year of which duration of things while he sleeps or thinks not he has no perception at all but it is quite lost to him and the moment wherein he leaves off to think till the moment he begins to think again seems to him to have no distance and so i doubt not it would be to a waking man if it were possible for him to keep only one idea in his mind without variation and the succession of others and we see that one who fixes his thoughts very intently on one thing so as to take but little notice of the succession of ideas that pass in his mind whilst he is taken up with that earnest contemplation lets slip out of his account a good part of that duration and thinks that time shorter than it is but if sleep commonly unites the distant parts of duration it is because during that time we have no succession of ideas in our minds for if a man during his sleep dreams and variety of ideas make themselves perceptible in his mind one after another he hath then during such dreaming a sense of duration and of the length of it by which it is to me very clear that men derive their ideas of duration from their reflections on the train of the ideas they observe to succeed one another in their own understandings without which observation they can have no notion of duration whatever may happen in the world the idea of duration applicable to things whilst we sleep indeed a man having from reflecting on the succession and number of his own thoughts got the notion or idea of duration he can apply that notion to things which exist while he does not think as he that has got the idea of extension from bodies by his sight or touch can apply it to distances where no body is seen or felt and therefore though a man has no perception of the length of duration which passed whilst he slept or thought not yet having observed the revolution of days and nights and found the length of their duration to be in appearance regular and constant he can upon the supposition that that revolution has proceeded after the same manner whilst he was asleep or thought not as it used to do at other times he can i say imagine and make allowance for the length of duration whilst he slept but if adam and eve when they were alone in the world instead of their ordinary nights sleep had passed the whole twentyfour hours in one continued sleep the duration of that twentyfour hours had been irrecoverably lost to them and been for ever left out of their account of time the idea of succession not from motion thus by reflecting on the appearing of various ideas one after another in our understandings we get the notion of succession which if any one should think we did rather get from our observation of motion by our senses he will perhaps be of my mind when he considers that even motion produces in his mind an idea of succession no otherwise than as it produces there a continued train of distinguishable ideas for a man looking upon a body really moving perceives yet no motion at all unless that motion produces a constant train of successive ideas vg a man becalmed at sea out of sight of land in a fair day may look on the sun or sea or ship a whole hour together and perceive no motion at all in either though it be certain that two and perhaps all of them have moved during that time a great way but as soon as he perceives either of them to have changed distance with some other body as soon as this motion produces any new idea in him then he perceives that there has been motion but wherever a man is with all things at rest about him without perceiving any motion at allif during this hour of quiet he has been thinking he will perceive the various ideas of his own thoughts in his own mind appearing one after another and thereby observe and find succession where he could observe no motion very slow motions unperceived and this i think is the reason why motions very slow though they are constant are not perceived by us because in their remove from one sensible part towards another their change of distance is so slow that it causes no new ideas in us but a good while one after another and so not causing a constant train of new ideas to follow one another immediately in our minds we have no perception of motion which consisting in a constant succession we cannot perceive that succession without a constant succession of varying ideas arising from it very swift motions unperceived on the contrary things that move so swift as not to affect the senses distinctly with several distinguishable distances of their motion and so cause not any train of ideas in the mind are not also perceived for anything that moves round about in a circle in less times than our ideas are wont to succeed one another in our minds is not perceived to move but seems to be a perfect entire circle of that matter or colour and not a part of a circle in motion the train of ideas has a certain degree of quickness hence i leave it to others to judge whether it be not probable that our ideas do whilst we are awake succeed one another in our minds at certain distances not much unlike the images in the inside of a lantern turned round by the heat of a candle this appearance of theirs in train though perhaps it may be sometimes faster and sometimes slower yet i guess varies not very much in a waking man there seem to be certain bounds to the quickness and slowness of the succession of those ideas one to another in our minds beyond which they can neither delay nor hasten real succession in swift motions without sense of succession the reason i have for this odd conjecture is from observing that in the impressions made upon any of our senses we can but to a certain degree perceive any succession which if exceeding quick the sense of succession is lost even in cases where it is evident that there is a real succession let a cannonbullet pass through a room and in its way take with it any limb or fleshy parts of a man it is as clear as any demonstration can be that it must strike successively the two sides of the room it is also evident that it must touch one part of the flesh first and another after and so in succession and yet i believe nobody who ever felt the pain of such a shot or heard the blow against the two distant walls could perceive any succession either in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke such a part of duration as this wherein we perceive no succession is that which we call an instant and is that which takes up the time of only one idea in our minds without the succession of another wherein therefore we perceive no succession at all in slow motions this also happens where the motion is so slow as not to supply a constant train of fresh ideas to the senses as fast as the mind is capable of receiving new ones into it and so other ideas of our own thoughts having room to come into our minds between those offered to our senses by the moving body there the sense of motion is lost and the body though it really moves yet not changing perceivable distance with some other bodies as fast as the ideas of our own minds do naturally follow one another in train the thing seems to stand still as is evident in the hands of clocks and shadows of sundials and other constant but slow motions where though after certain intervals we perceive by the change of distance that it hath moved yet the motion itself we perceive not this train the measure of other successions so that to me it seems that the constant and regular succession of ideas in a waking man is as it were the measure and standard of all other successions whereof if any one either exceeds the pace of our ideas as where two sounds or pains c take up in their succession the duration of but one idea or else where any motion or succession is so slow as that it keeps not pace with the ideas in our minds or the quickness in which they take their turns as when any one or more ideas in their ordinary course come into our mind between those which are offered to the sight by the different perceptible distances of a body in motion or between sounds or smells following one anotherthere also the sense of a constant continued succession is lost and we perceive it not but with certain gaps of rest between the mind cannot fix long on one invariable idea if it be so that the ideas of our minds whilst we have any there do constantly change and shift in a continual succession it would be impossible may any one say for a man to think long of any one thing by which if it be meant that a man may have one selfsame single idea a long time alone in his mind without any variation at all i think in matter of fact it is not possible for which not knowing how the ideas of our minds are framed of what materials they are made whence they have their light and how they come to make their appearances i can give no other reason but experience and i would have any one try whether he can keep one unvaried single idea in his mind without any other for any considerable time together proof for trial let him take any figure any degree of light or whiteness or what other he pleases and he will i suppose find it difficult to keep all other ideas out of his mind but that some either of another kind or various considerations of that idea each of which considerations is a new idea will constantly succeed one another in his thoughts let him be as wary as he can the extent of our power over the succession of our ideas all that is in a mans power in this case i think is only to mind and observe what the ideas are that take their turns in his understanding or else to direct the sort and call in such as he hath a desire or use of but hinder the constant succession of fresh ones i think he cannot though he may commonly choose whether he will heedfully observe and consider them ideas however made include no sense of motion whether these several ideas in a mans mind be made by certain motions i will not here dispute but this i am sure that they include no idea of motion in their appearance and if a man had not the idea of motion otherwise i think he would have none at all which is enough to my present purpose and sufficiently shows that the notice we take of the ideas of our own minds appearing there one after another is that which gives us the idea of succession and duration without which we should have no such ideas at all it is not then motion but the constant train of ideas in our minds whilst we are waking that furnishes us with the idea of duration whereof motion no otherwise gives us any perception than as it causes in our minds a constant succession of ideas as i have before showed and we have as clear an idea of succession and duration by the train of other ideas succeeding one another in our minds without the idea of any motion as by the train of ideas caused by the uninterrupted sensible change of distance between two bodies which we have from motion and therefore we should as well have the idea of duration were there no sense of motion at all time is duration set out by measures having thus got the idea of duration the next thing natural for the mind to do is to get some measure of this common duration whereby it might judge of its different lengths and consider the distinct order wherein several things exist without which a great part of our knowledge would be confused and a great part of history be rendered very useless this consideration of duration as set out by certain periods and marked by certain measures or epochs is that i think which most properly we call time a good measure of time must divide its whole duration into equal periods in the measuring of extension there is nothing more required but the application of the standard or measure we make use of to the thing of whose extension we would be informed but in the measuring of duration this cannot be done because no two different parts of succession can be put together to measure one another and nothing being a measure of duration but duration as nothing is of extension but extension we cannot keep by us any standing unvarying measure of duration which consists in a constant fleeting succession as we can of certain lengths of extension as inches feet yards c marked out in permanent parcels of matter nothing then could serve well for a convenient measure of time but what has divided the whole length of its duration into apparently equal portions by constantly repeated periods what portions of duration are not distinguished or considered as distinguished and measured by such periods come not so properly under the notion of time as appears by such phrases as these viz before all time and when time shall be no more the revolutions of the sun and moon the properest measures of time for mankind the diurnal and annual revolutions of the sun as having been from the beginning of nature constant regular and universally observable by all mankind and supposed equal to one another have been with reason made use of for the measure of duration but the distinction of days and years having depended on the motion of the sun it has brought this mistake with it that it has been thought that motion and duration were the measure one of another for men in the measuring of the length of time having been accustomed to the ideas of minutes hours days months years c which they found themselves upon any mention of time or duration presently to think on all which portions of time were measured out by the motion of those heavenly bodies they were apt to confound time and motion or at least to think that they had a nece ssary connexionone with another whereas any constant periodical appearance or alteration of ideas in seemingly equidistant spaces of duration if constant and universally observable would have as well distinguished the intervals of time as those that have been made use of for supposing the sun which some have taken to be a fire had been lighted up at the same distance of time that it now every day comes about to the same meridian and then gone out again about twelve hours after and that in the space of an annual revolution it had sensibly increased in brightness and heat and so decreased againwould not such regular appearances serve to measure out the distances of duration to all that could observe it as well without as with motion for if the appearances were constant universally observable in equidistant periods they would serve mankind for measure of time as well were the motion away but not by their motion but periodical appearances for the freezing of water or the blowing of a plant returning at equidistant periods in all parts of the earth would as well serve men to reckon their years by as the motions of the sun and in effect we see that some people in america counted their years by the coming of certain birds amongst them at their certain seasons and leaving them at others for a fit of an ague the sense of hunger or thirst a smell or a taste or any other idea returning constantly at equidistant periods and making itself universally be taken notice of would not fail to measure out the course of succession and distinguish the distances of time thus we see that men born blind count time well enough by years whose revolutions yet they cannot distinguish by motions that they perceive not and i ask whether a blind man who distinguished his years either by the heat of summer or cold of winter by the smell of any flower of the spring or taste of any fruit of the autumn would not have a better measure of time than the romans had before the reformation of their calendar by julius caesar or many other people whose years notwithstanding the motion of the sun which they pretended to make use of are very irregular and it adds no small difficulty to chronology that the exact lengths of the years that several nations counted by are hard to be known they differing very much one from another and i think i may say all of them from the precise motion of the sun and if the sun moved from the creation to the flood constantly in the equator and so equally dispersed its light and heat to all the habitable parts of the earth in days all of the same length without its annual variations to the tropics as a late ingenious author supposes i do not think it very easy to imagine that notwithstanding the motion of the sun men should in the antediluvian world from the beginning count by years or measure their time by periods that had no sensible marks very obvious to distinguish them by no two parts of duration can be certainly known to be equal but perhaps it will be saidwithout a regular motion such as of the sun or some other how could it ever be known that such periods were equal to which i answerthe equality of any other returning appearances might be known by the same way that that of days was known or presumed to be so at first which was only by judging of them by the train of ideas which had passed in mens minds in the intervals by which train of ideas discovering inequality in the natural days but none in the artificial days the artificial days or nuchtheerha were guessed to be equal which was sufficient to make them serve for a measure though exacter search has since discovered inequality in the diurnal revolutions of the sun and we know not whether the annual also be not unequal these yet by their presumed and apparent equality serve as well to reckon time by though not to measure the parts of duration exactly as if they could be proved to be exactly equal we must therefore carefully distinguish betwixt duration itself and the measures we make use of to judge of its length duration in itself is to be considered as going on in one constant equal uniform course but none of the measures of it which we make use of can be known to do so nor can we be assured that their assigned parts or periods are equal in duration one to another for two successive lengths of duration however measured can never be demonstrated to be equal the motion of the sun which the world used so long and so confidently for an exact measure of duration has as i said been found in its several parts unequal and though men have of late made use of a pendulum as a more steady and regular motion than that of the sun or to speak more truly of the earthyet if any one should be asked how he certainly knows that the two successive swings of a pendulum are equal it would be very hard to satisfy him that they are infallibly so since we cannot be sure that the cause of that motion which is unknown to us shall always operate equally and we are sure that the medium in which the pendulum moves is not constantly the same either of which varying may alter the equality of such periods and thereby destroy the certainty and exactness of the measure by motion as well as any other periods of other appearances the notion of duration still remaining clear though our measures of it cannot any of them be demonstrated to be exact since then no two portions of succession can be brought together it is impossible ever certainly to know their equality all that we can do for a measure of time is to take such as have continual successive appearances at seemingly equidistant periods of which seeming equality we have no other measure but such as the train of our own ideas have lodged in our memories with the concurrence of other probable reasons to persuade us of their equality time not the measure of motion one thing seems strange to methat whilst all men manifestly measured time by the motion of the great and visible bodies of the world time yet should be defined to be the measure of motion whereas it is obvious to every one who reflects ever so little on it that to measure motion space is as necessary to be considered as time and those who look a little farther will find also the bulk of the thing moved necessary to be taken into the computation by any one who will estimate or measure motion so as to judge right of it nor indeed does motion any otherwise conduce to the measuring of duration than as it constantly brings about the return of certain sensible ideas in seeming equidistant periods for if the motion of the sun were as unequal as of a ship driven by unsteady winds sometimes very slow and at others irregularly very swift or if being constantly equally swift it yet was not circular and produced not the same appearancesit would not at all help us to measure time any more than the seeming unequal motion of a comet does minutes hours days and years not necessary measures of duration minutes hours days and years are then no more necessary to time or duration than inches feet yards and miles marked out in any matter are to extension for though we in this part of the universe by the constant use of them as of periods set out by the revolutions of the sun or as known parts of such periods have fixed the ideas of such lengths of duration in our minds which we apply to all parts of time whose lengths we would consider yet there may be other parts of the universe where they no more use there measures of ours than in japan they do our inches feet or miles but yet something analogous to them there must be for without some regular periodical returns we could not measure ourselves or signify to others the length of any duration though at the same time the world were as full of motion as it is now but no part of it disposed into regular and apparently equidistant revolutions but the different measures that may be made use of for the account of time do not at all alter the notion of duration which is the thing to be measured no more than the different standards of a foot and a cubit alter the notion of extension to those who make use of those different measures our measure of time applicable to duration before time the mind having once got such a measure of time as the annual revolution of the sun can apply that measure to duration wherein that measure itself did not exist and with which in the reality of its being it had nothing to do for should one say that abraham was born in the two thousand seven hundred and twelfth year of the julian period it is altogether as intelligible as reckoning from the beginning of the world though there were so far back no motion of the sun nor any motion at all for though the julian period be supposed to begin several hundred years before there were really either days nights or years marked out by any revolutions of the sunyet we reckon as right and thereby measure durations as well as if really at that time the sun had existed and kept the same ordinary motion it doth now the idea of duration equal to an annual revolution of the sun is as easily applicable in our thoughts to duration where no sun or motion was as the idea of a foot or yard taken from bodies here can be applied in our thoughts to duration where no sun or motion was as the idea of a foot or yard taken from bodies here can be applied in our thoughts to distances beyond the confines of the world where are no bodies at all as we can measure space in our thoughts where there is no body for supposing it were miles or millions of miles from this place to the remotest body of the universe for being finite it must be at a certain distance as we suppose it to be years from this time to the first existence of any body in the beginning of the worldwe can in our thoughts apply this measure of a year to duration before the creation or beyond the duration of bodies or motion as we can this measure of a mile to space beyond the utmost bodies and by the one measure duration where there was no motion as well as by the other measure space in our thoughts where there is no body the assumption that the world is neither boundless nor eternal if it be objected to me here that in this way of explaining of time i have begged what i should not viz that the world is neither eternal nor infinite i answer that to my present purpose it is not needful in this place to make use of arguments to evince the world to be finite both in duration and extension but it being at least as conceivable as the contrary i have certainly the liberty to suppose it as well as any one hath to suppose the contrary and i doubt not but that every one that will go about it may easily conceive in his mind the beginning of motion though not of all duration and so may come to a step and non ultra in his consideration of motion so also in his thoughts he may set limits to body and the extension belonging to it but not to space where no body is the utmost bounds of space and duration being beyond the reach of thought as well as the utmost bounds of number are beyond the largest comprehension of the mind and all for the same reason as we shall see in another place eternity by the same means therefore and from the same original that we come to have the idea of time we have also that idea which we call eternity viz having got the idea of succession and duration by reflecting on the train of our own ideas caused in us either by the natural appearances of those ideas coming constantly of themselves into our waking thoughts or else caused by external objects successively affecting our senses and having from the revolutions of the sun got the ideas of certain lengths of durationwe can in our thoughts add such lengths of duration to one another as often as we please and apply them so added to durations past or to come and this we can continue to do on without bounds or limits and proceed in infinitum and apply thus the length of the annual motion of the sun to duration supposed before the suns or any other motion had its being which is no more difficult or absurd than to apply the notion i have of the moving of a shadow one hour today upon the sundial to the duration of something last night vg the burning of a candle which is now absolutely separate from all actual motion and it is as impossible for the duration of that flame for an hour last night to coexist with any motion that now is or for ever shall be as for any part of duration that was before the beginning of the world to coexist with the motion of the sun now but yet this hinders not but that having the idea of the length of the motion of the shadow on a dial between the marks of two hours i can as distinctly measure in my thoughts the duration of that candlelight last night as i can the duration of anything that does now exist and it is no more than to think that had the sun shone then on the dial and moved after the same rate it doth now the shadow on the dial would have passed from one hourline to another whilst that flame of the candle lasted our measures of duration dependent on our ideas the notion of an hour day or year being only the idea i have of the length of certain periodical regular motions neither of which motions do ever all at once exist but only in the ideas i have of them in my memory derived from my senses or reflection i can with the same ease and for the same reason apply it in my thoughts to duration antecedent to all manner of motion as well as to anything that is but a minute or a day antecedent to the motion that at this very moment the sun is in all things past are equally and perfectly at rest and to this way of consideration of them are all one whether they were before the beginning of the world or but yesterday the measuring of any duration by some motion depending not at all on the real coexistence of that thing to that motion or any other periods of revolution but the having a clear idea of the length of some periodical known motion or other in terval of duration in my mind and applying that to the duration of the thing i would measure the duration of anything need not be coexistent with the motion we measure it by hence we see that some men imagine the duration of the world from its first existence to this present year to have been years or equal to annual revolutions of the sun and others a great deal more as the egyptians of old who in the time of alexander counted years from the reign of the sun and the chinese now who account the world years old or more which longer duration of the world according to their computation though i should not believe to be true yet i can equally imagine it with them and as truly understand and say one is longer than the other as i understand that methusalems life was longer than enochs and if the common reckoning of should be true as it may be as well as any other assigned it hinders not at all my imagining what others mean when they make the world one thousand years older since every one may with the same facility imagine i do not say believe the world to be years old as and may as well conceive the duration of years as whereby it appears that to the measuring the duration of anything by time it is not requisite that that thing should be coexistent to the motion we measure by or any other periodical revolution but it suffices to this purpose that we have the idea of the length of any regular periodical appearances which we can in our minds apply to duration with which the motion or appearance never coexisted infinity in duration for as in the history of the creation delivered by moses i can imagine that light existed three days before the sun was or had any motion barely by thinking that the duration of light before the sun was created was so long as if the sun had moved then as it doth now would have been equal to three of his diurnal revolutions so by the same way i can have an idea of the chaos or angels being created before there was either light or any continued motion a minute an hour a day a year or one thousand years for if i can but consider duration equal to one minute before either the being or motion of any body i can add one minute more till i come to sixty and by the same way of adding minutes hours or years ie such or such parts of the suns revolutions or any other period whereof i have the idea proceed in infinitum and suppose a duration exceeding as many such periods as i can reckon let me add whilst i will which i think is the notion we have of eternity of whose infinity we have no other notion than we have of the infinity of number to which we can add for ever without end origin of our ideas of duration and of the measures of it and thus i think it is plain that from those two fountains of all knowledge before mentioned viz reflection and sensation we got the ideas of duration and the measures of it for first by observing what passes in our minds how our ideas there in train constantly some vanish and others begin to appear we come by the idea of succession secondly by observing a distance in the parts of this succession we get the idea of duration thirdly by sensation observing certain appearances at certain regular and seeming equidistant periods we get the ideas of certain lengths or measures of duration as minutes hours days years c fourthly by being able to repeat those measures of time or ideas of stated length of duration in our minds as often as we will we can come to imagine duration where nothing does really endure or exist and thus we imagine tomorrow next year or seven years hence fifthly by being able to repeat ideas of any length of time as of a minute a year or an age as often as we will in our own thoughts and adding them one to another without ever coming to the end of such addition any nearer than we can to the end of number to which we can always add we come by the idea of eternity as the future eternal duration of our souls as well as the eternity of that infinite being which must necessarily have always existed sixthly by considering any part of infinite duration as set out by periodical measures we come by the idea of what we call time in general ideas of duration and expansion considered together both capable of greater and less though we have in the precedent chapters dwelt pretty long on the considerations of space and duration yet they being ideas of general concernment that have something very abstruse and peculiar in their nature the comparing them one with another may perhaps be of use for their illustration and we may have the more clear and distinct conception of them by taking a view of them together distance or space in its simple abstract conception to avoid confusion i call expansion to distinguish it from extension which by some is used to express this distance only as it is in the solid parts of matter and so includes or at least intimates the idea of body whereas the idea of pure distance includes no such thing i prefer also the word expansion to space because space is often applied to distance of fleeting successive parts which never exist together as well as to those which are permanent in both these viz expansion and duration the mind has this common idea of continued lengths capable of greater or less quantities for a man has as clear an idea of the difference of the length of an hour and a day as of an inch and a foot expansion not bounded by matter the mind having got the idea of the length of any part of expansion let it be a span or a pace or what length you will can as has been said repeat that idea and so adding it to the former enlarge its idea of length and make it equal to two spans or two paces and so as often as it will till it equals the distance of any parts of the earth one from another and increase thus till it amounts to the distance of the sun or remotest star by such a progression as this setting out from the place where it is or any other place it can proceed and pass beyond all those lengths and find nothing to stop its going on either in or without body it is true we can easily in our thoughts come to the end of solid extension the extremity and bounds of all body we have no difficulty to arrive at but when the mind is there it finds nothing to hinder its progress into this endless expansion of that it can neither find nor conceive any end nor let any one say that beyond the bounds of body there is nothing at all unless he will confine god within the limits of matter solomon whose understanding was filled and enlarged with wisdom seems to have other thoughts when he says heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee and he i think very much magnifies to himself the capacity of his own understanding who persuades himself that he can extend his thoughts further than god exists or imagine any expansion where he is not nor duration by motion just so is it in duration the mind having got the idea of any length of duration can double multiply and enlarge it not only beyond its own but beyond the existence of all corporeal beings and all the measures of time taken from the great bodies of all the world and their motions but yet every one easily admits that though we make duration boundless as certainly it is we cannot yet extend it beyond all being god every one easily allows fills eternity and it is hard to find a reason why any one should doubt that he likewise fills immensity his infinite being is certainly as boundless one way as another and methinks it ascribes a little too much to matter to say where there is no body there is nothing why men more easily admit infinite duration than infinite expansion hence i think we may learn the reason why every one familiarly and without the least hesitation speaks of and supposes eternity and sticks not to ascribe infinity to duration but it is with more doubting and reserve that many admit or suppose the infinity of space the reason whereof seems to me to be this that duration and extension being used as names of affections belonging to other beings we easily conceive in god infinite duration and we cannot avoid doing so but not attributing to him extension but only to matter which is finite we are apter to doubt of the existence of expansion without matter of which alone we commonly suppose it an attribute and therefore when men pursue their thoughts of space they are apt to stop at the confines of body as if space were there at an end too and reached no further or if their ideas upon consideration carry them further yet they term what is beyond the limits of the universe imaginary space as if it were nothing because there is no body existing in it whereas duration antecedent to all body and to the motions which it is measured by they never term imaginary because it is never supposed void of some other real existence and if the names of things may at all direct our thoughts towards the original of mens ideas as i am apt to think they may very much one may have occasion to think by the name duration that the continuation of existence with a kind of resistance to any destructive force and the continuation of solidity which is apt to be confounded with and if we will look into the minute anatomical parts of matter is little different from hardness were thought to have some analogy and gave occasion to words so near of kin as durare and durum esse and that durare is applied to the idea of hardness as well as that of existence we see in horace epod xvi ferro duravit secula but be that as it will this is certain that whoever pursues his own thoughts will find them sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body into the infinity of space or expansion the idea whereof is distinct and separate from body and all other things which may to those who please be a subject of further meditation time to duration is as place to expansion time in general is to duration as place to expansion they are so much of those boundless oceans of eternity and immensity as is set out and distinguished from the rest as it were by landmarks and so are made use of to denote the position of finite real beings in respect one to another in those uniform infinite oceans of duration and space these rightly considered are only ideas of determinate distances from certain known points fixed in distinguishable sensible things and supposed to keep the same distance one from another from such points fixed in sensible beings we reckon and from them we measure our portions of those infinite quantities which so considered are that which we call time and place for duration and space being in themselves uniform and boundless the order and position of things without such known settled points would be lost in them and all things would lie jumbled in an incurable confusion time and place are taken for so much of either as are set out by the existence and motion of bodies time and place taken thus for determinate distinguishable portions of those infinite abysses of space and duration set out or supposed to be distinguished from the rest by marks and known boundaries have each of them a twofold acceptation first time in general is commonly taken for so much of infinite duration as is measured by and coexistent with the existence and motions of the great bodies of the universe as far as we know anything of them and in this sense time begins and ends with the frame of this sensible world as in these phrases before mentioned before all time or when time shall be no more place likewise is taken sometimes for that portion of infinite space which is possessed by and comprehended within the material world and is thereby distinguished from the rest of expansion though this may be more properly called extension than place within these two are confined and by the observable parts of them are measured and determined the particular time or duration and the particular extension and place of all corporeal beings sometimes for so much of either as we design by measures taken from the bulk or motion of bodies secondly sometimes the word time is used in a larger sense and is applied to parts of that infinite duration not that were really distinguished and measured out by this real existence and periodical motions of bodies that were appointed from the beginning to be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and are accordingly our measures of time but such other portions too of that infinite uniform duration which we upon any occasion do suppose equal to certain lengths of measured time and so consider them as bounded and determined for if we should suppose the creation or fall of the angels was at the beginning of the julian period we should speak properly enough and should be understood if we said it is a longer time since the creation of angels than the creation of the world by years whereby we would mark out so much of that undistinguished duration as we suppose equal to and would have admitted annual revolutions of the sun moving at the rate it now does and thus likewise we sometimes speak of place distance or bulk in the great inane beyond the confines of the world when we consider so much of that space as is equal to or capable to receive a body of any assigned dimensions as a cubic foot or do suppose a point in it at such a certain distance from any part of the universe they belong to all finite beings where and when are questions belonging to all finite existences and are by us always reckoned from some known parts of this sensible world and from some certain epochs marked out to us by the motions observable in it without some such fixed parts or periods the order of things would be lost to our finite understandings in the boundless invariable oceans of duration and expansion which comprehend in them all finite beings and in their full extent belong only to the deity and therefore we are not to wonder that we comprehend them not and do so often find our thoughts at a loss when we would consider them either abstractly in themselves or as any way attributed to the first incomprehensible being but when applied to any particular finite beings the extension of any body is so much of that infinite space as the bulk of the body takes up and place is the position of any body when considered at a certain distance from some other as the idea of the particular duration of anything is an idea of that portion of infinite duration which passes during the existence of that thing so the time when the thing existed is the idea of that space of duration which passed between some known and fixed period of duration and the being of that thing one shows the distance of the extremities of the bulk or existence of the same thing as that it is a foot square or lasted two years the other shows the distance of it in place or existence from other fixed points of space or duration as that it was in the middle of lincolns inn fields or the first degree of taurus and in the year of our lord or the th year of the julian period all which distances we measure by preconceived ideas of certain lengths of space and durationas inches feet miles and degrees and in the other minutes days and years c all the parts of extension are extension and all the parts of duration are duration there is one thing more wherein space and duration have a great conformity and that is though they are justly reckoned amongst our simple ideas yet none of the distinct ideas we have of either is without all manner of composition it is the very nature of both of them to consist of parts but their parts being all of the same kind and without the mixture of any other idea hinder them not from having a place amongst simple ideas could the mind as in number come to so small a part of extension or duration as excluded divisibility that would be as it were the indivisible unit or idea by repetition of which it would make its more enlarged ideas of extension and duration but since the mind is not able to frame an idea of any space without parts instead thereof it makes use of the common measures which by familiar use in each country have imprinted themselves on the memory as inches and feet or cubits and parasangs and so seconds minutes hours days and years in durationthe mind makes use i say of such ideas as these as simple ones and these are the component parts of larger ideas which the mind upon occasion makes by the addition of such known lengths which it is acquainted with on the other side the ordinary smallest measure we have of either is looked on as an unit in number when the mind by division would reduce them into less fractions though on both sides both in addition and division either of space or duration when the idea under consideration becomes very big or very small its precise bulk becomes very obscure and confused and it is the number of its repeated additions or divisions that alone remains clear and distinct as will easily appear to any one who will let his thoughts loose in the vast expansion of space or divisibility of matter every part of duration is duration too and every part of extension is extension both of them capable of addition or division in infinitum but the least portions of either of them whereof we have clear and distinct ideas may perhaps be fittest to be considered by us as the simple ideas of that kind out of which our complex modes of space extension and duration are made up and into which they can again be distinctly resolved such a small part in duration may be called a moment and is the time of one idea in our minds in the train of their ordinary succession there the other wanting a proper name i know not whether i may be allowed to call a sensible point meaning thereby the least particle of matter or space we can discern which is ordinarily about a minute and to the sharpest eyes seldom less than thirty seconds of a circle whereof the eye is the centre their parts inseparable expansion and duration have this further agreement that though they are both considered by us as having parts yet their parts are not separable one from another no not even in thought though the parts of bodies from whence we take our measure of the one and the parts of motion or rather the succession of ideas in our minds from whence we take the measure of the other may be interrupted and separated as the one is often by rest and the other is by sleep which we call rest too duration is as a line expansion as a solid but there is this manifest difference between themthat the ideas of length which we have of expansion are turned every way and so make figure and breadth and thickness but duration is but as it were the length of one straight line extended in infinitum not capable of multiplicity variation or figure but is one common measure of all existence whatsoever wherein all things whilst they exist equally partake for this present moment is common to all things that are now in being and equally comprehends that part of their existence as much as if they were all but one single being and we may truly say they all exist in the same moment of time whether angels and spirits have any analogy to this in respect to expansion is beyond my comprehension and perhaps for us who have understandings and comprehensions suited to our own preservation and the ends of our own being but not to the reality and extent of all other beings it is near as hard to conceive any existence or to have an idea of any real being with a perfect negation of all manner of expansion as it is to have the idea of any real existence with a perfect negation of all manner of duration and therefore what spirits have to do with space or how they communicate in it we know not all that we know is that bodies do each singly possess its proper portion of it according to the extent of solid parts and thereby exclude all other bodies from having any share in that particular portion of space whilst it remains there duration has never two parts together expansion altogether duration and time which is a part of it is the idea we have of perishing distance of which no two parts exist together but follow each other in succession an expansion is the idea of lasting distance all whose parts exist together and are not capable of succession and therefore though we cannot conceive any duration without succession nor can put it together in our thoughts that any being does now exist tomorrow or possess at once more than the present moment of duration yet we can conceive the eternal duration of the almighty far different from that of man or any other finite being because man comprehends not in his knowledge or power all past and future things his thoughts are but of yesterday and he knows not what tomorrow will bring forth what is once past he can never recall and what is yet to come he cannot make present what i say of man i say of all finite beings who though they may far exceed man in knowledge and power yet are no more than the meanest creature in comparison with god himself finite or any magnitude holds not any proportion to infinite gods infinite duration being accompanied with infinite knowledge and infinite power he sees all things past and to come and they are no more distant from his knowledge no further removed from his sight than the present they all lie under the same view and there is nothing which he cannot make exist each moment he pleases for the existence of all things depending upon his good pleasure all things exist every moment that he thinks fit to have them exist to conclude expansion and duration do mutually embrace and comprehend each other every part of space being in every part of duration and every part of duration in every part of expansion such a com bination of two distinct ideas is i suppose scarce to be found in all that great variety we do or can conceive and may afford matter to further speculation idea of number number the simplest and most universal idea amongst all the ideas we have as there is none suggested to the mind by more ways so there is none more simple than that of unity or one it has no shadow of variety or composition in it every object our senses are employed about every idea in our understandings every thought of our minds brings this idea along with it and therefore it is the most intimate to our thoughts as well as it is in its agreement to all other things the most universal idea we have for number applies itself to men angels actions thoughts everything that either doth exist or can be imagined its modes made by addition by repeating this idea in our minds and adding the repetitions together we come by the complex ideas of the modes of it thus by adding one to one we have the complex idea of a couple by putting twelve units together we have the complex idea of a dozen and so of a score or a million or any other number each mode distinct the simple modes of number are of all other the most distinct every the least variation which is an unit making each combination as clearly different from that which approacheth nearest to it as the most remote two being as distinct from one as two hundred and the idea of two as distinct from the idea of three as the magnitude of the whole earth is from that of a mite this is not so in other simple modes in which it is not so easy nor perhaps possible for us to distinguish betwixt two approaching ideas which yet are really different for who will undertake to find a difference between the white of this paper and that of the next degree to it or can form distinct ideas of every the least excess in extension therefore demonstrations in numbers the most precise the clearness and distinctness of each mode of number from all others even those that approach nearest makes me apt to think that demonstrations in numbers if they are not more evident and exact than in extension yet they are more general in their use and more determinate in their application because the ideas of numbers are more precise and distinguishable than in extension where every equality and excess are not so easy to be observed or measured because our thoughts cannot in space arrive at any determined smallness beyond which it cannot go as an unit and therefore the quantity or proportion of any the least excess cannot be discovered which is clear otherwise in number where as has been said is as distinguishable from go as from though be the next immediate excess to but it is not so in extension where whatsoever is more than just a foot or an inch is not distinguishable from the standard of a foot or an inch and in lines which appear of an equal length one may be longer than the other by innumerable parts nor can any one assign an angle which shall be the next biggest to a right one names necessary to numbers by the repeating as has been said the idea of an unit and joining it to another unit we make thereof one collective idea marked by the name two and whosoever can do this and proceed on still adding one more to the last collective idea which he had of any number and gave a name to it may count or have ideas for several collections of units distinguished one from another as far as he hath a series of names for following numbers and a memory to retain that series with their several names all numeration being but still the adding of one unit more and giving to the whole together as comprehended in one idea a new or distinct name or sign whereby to know it from those before and after and distinguish it from every smaller or greater multitude of units so that he that can add one to one and so to two and so go on with his tale taking still with him the distinct names belonging to every progression and so again by subtracting an unit from each collection retreat and lessen them is capable of all the ideas of numbers within the compass of his language or for which he hath names though not perhaps of more for the several simple modes of numbers being in our minds but so many combinations of units which have no variety nor are capable of any other difference but more or less names or marks for each distinct combination seem more necessary than in any other sort of ideas for without such names or marks we can hardly well make use of numbers in reckoning especially where the combination is made up of any great multitude of units which put together without a name or mark to distinguish that precise collection will hardly be kept from being a heap in confusion another reason for the necessity of names to numbers this i think to be the reason why some americans i have spoken with who were otherwise of quick and rational parts enough could not as we do by any means count to nor had any distinct idea of that number though they could reckon very well to because their language being scanty and accommodated only to the few necessaries of a needy simple life unacquainted either with trade or mathematics had no words in it to stand for so that when they were discoursed with of those greater numbers they would show the hairs of their head to express a great multitude which they could not number which inability i suppose proceeded from their want of names the tououpinambos had no names for numbers above any number beyond that they made out by showing their fingers and the fingers of others who were present and i doubt not but we ourselves might distinctly number in words a great deal further than we usually do would we find out but some fit denominations to signify them by whereas in the way we take now to name them by millions of millions of millions c it is hard to go beyond eighteen or at most four and twenty decimal progressions without confusion but to show how much distinct names conduce to our well reckoning or having useful ideas of numbers let us see all these following figures in one continued line as the marks of one number v g nonillions octillions septillions sextillions quintrillions quartrillions trillions billions millions units the ordinary way of naming this number in english will be the often repeating of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions which is the denomination of the second six figures in which way it will be very hard to have any distinguishing notions of this number but whether by giving every six figures a new and orderly denomination these and perhaps a great many more figures in progression might not easily be counted distinctly and ideas of them both got more easily to ourselves and more plainly signified to others i leave it to be considered this i mention only to show how necessary distinct names are to numbering without pretending to introduce new ones of my invention why children number not earlier thus children either for want of names to mark the several progressions of numbers or not having yet the faculty to collect scattered ideas into complex ones and range them in a regular order and so retain them in their memories as is necessary to reckoning do not begin to number very early nor proceed in it very far or steadily till a good while after they are well furnished with good store of other ideas and one may often observe them discourse and reason pretty well and have very clear conceptions of several other things before they can tell twenty and some through the default of their memories who cannot retain the several combinations of numbers with their names annexed in their distinct orders and the dependence of so long a train of numeral progressions and their relation one to another are not able all their lifetime to reckon or regularly go over any moderate series of numbers for he that will count twenty or have any idea of that number must know that nineteen went before with the distinct name or sign of every one of them as they stand marked in their order for wherever this fails a gap is made the chain breaks and the progress in numbering can go no further so that to reckon right it is required that the mind distinguish carefully two ideas which are different one from another only by the addition or subtraction of one unit that it retain in memory the names or marks of the several combinations from an unit to that number and that not confusedly and at random but in that exact order that the numbers follow one another in either of which if it trips the whole business of numbering will be disturbed and there will remain only the confused idea of multitude but the ideas necessary to distinct numeration will not be attained to number measures all measureables this further is observable in number that it is that which the mind makes use of in measuring all things that by us are measurable which principally are expansion and duration and our idea of infinity even when applied to those seems to be nothing but the infinity of number for what else are our ideas of eternity and immensity but the repeated additions of certain ideas of imagined parts of duration and expansion with the infinity of number in which we can come to no end of addition for such an inexhaustible stock number of all other our ideas most clearly furnishes us with as is obvious to every one for let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he pleases this multitude how great soever lessens not one jot the power of adding to it or brings him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number where still there remains as much to be added as if none were taken out and this endless addition or addibility if any one like the word better of numbers so apparent to the mind is that i think which gives us the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity of which more in the following chapter of infinity infinity in its original intention attributed to space duration and number he that would know what kind of idea it is to which we give the name of infinity cannot do it better than by considering to what infinity is by the mind more immediately attributed and then how the mind comes to frame it finite and infinite seem to me to be looked upon by the mind as the modes of quantity and to be attributed primarily in their first designation only to those things which have parts and are capable of increase or diminution by the addition or subtraction of any the least part and such are the ideas of space duration and number which we have considered in the foregoing chapters it is true that we cannot but be assured that the great god of whom and from whom are all things is incomprehensibly infinite but yet when we apply to that first and supreme being our idea of infinite in our weak and narrow thoughts we do it primarily in respect to his duration and ubiquity and i think more figuratively to his power wisdom and goodness and other attributes which are properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible c for when we call them infinite we have no other idea of this infinity but what carries with it some reflection on and imitation of that number or extent of the acts or objects of gods power wisdom and goodness which can never be supposed so great or so many which these attributes will not always surmount and exceed let us multiply them in our thoughts as far as we can with all the infinity of endless number i do not pretend to say how these attributes are in god who is infinitely beyond the reach of our narrow capacities they do without doubt contain in them all possible perfection but this i say is our way of conceiving them and these our ideas of their infinity the idea of finite easily got finite then and infinite being by the mind looked on as modifications of expansion and duration the next thing to be considered ishow the mind comes by them as for the idea of finite there is no great difficulty the obvious portions of extension that affect our senses carry with them into the mind the idea of finite and the ordinary periods of succession whereby we measure time and duration as hours days and years are bounded lengths the difficulty is how we come by those boundless ideas of eternity and immensity since the objects we converse with come so much short of any approach or proportion to that largeness how we come by the idea of infinity every one that has any idea of any stated lengths of space as a foot finds that he can repeat that idea and joining it to the former make the idea of two feet and by the addition of a third three feet and so on without ever coming to an end of his additions whether of the same idea of a foot or if he pleases of doubling it or any other idea he has of any length as a mile or diameter of the earth or of the orbis magnus for whichever of these he takes and how often soever he doubles or any otherwise multiplies it he finds that after he has continued his doubling in his thoughts and enlarged his idea as much as he pleases he has no more reason to stop nor is one jot nearer the end of such addition than he was at first setting out the power of enlarging his idea of space by further additions remaining still the same he hence takes the idea of infinite space our idea of space boundless this i think is the way whereby the mind gets the idea of infinite space it is a quite different consideration to examine whether the mind has the idea of such a boundless space actually existing since our ideas are not always proofs of the existence of things but yet since this comes here in our way i suppose i may say that we are apt to think that space in itself is actually boundless to which imagination the idea of space or expansion of itself naturally leads us for it being considered by us either as the extension of body or as existing by itself without any solid matter taking it up for of such a void space we have not only the idea but i have proved as i think from the motion of body its necessary existence it is impossible the mind should be ever able to find or suppose any end of it or be stopped anywhere in its progress in this space how far soever it extends its thoughts any bounds made with body even adamantine walls are so far from putting a stop to the mind in its further progress in space and extension that it rather facilitates and enlarges it for so far as that body reaches so far no one can doubt of extension and when we are come to the utmost extremity of body what is there that can there put a stop and satisfy the mind that it is at the end of space when it perceives that it is not nay when it is satisfied that body itself can move into it for if it be necessary for the motion of body that there should be an empty space though ever so little here amongst bodies and if it be possible for body to move in or through that empty spacenay it is impossible for any particle of matter to move but into an empty space the same possibility of a bodys moving into a void space beyond the utmost bounds of body as well as into a void space interspersed amongst bodies will always remain clear and evident the idea of empty pure space whether within or beyond the confines of all bodies being exactly the same differing not in nature though in bulk and there being nothing to hinder body from moving into it so that wherever the mind places itself by any thought either amongst or remote from all bodies it can in this uniform idea of space nowhere find any bounds any end and so must necessarily conclude it by the very nature and idea of each part of it to be actually infinite and so of duration as by the power we find in ourselves of repeating as often as we will any idea of space we get the idea of immensity so by being able to repeat the idea of any length of duration we have in our minds with all the endless addition of number we come by the idea of eternity for we find in ourselves we can no more come to an end of such repeated ideas than we can come to the end of number which every one perceives he cannot but here again it is another question quite different from our having an idea of eternity to know whether there were any real being whose duration has been eternal and as to this i say he that considers something now existing must necessarily come to something eternal but having spoke of this in another place i shall say here no more of it but proceed on to some other considerations of our idea of infinity why other ideas are not capable of infinity if it be so that our idea of infinity be got from the power we observe in ourselves of repeating without end our own ideas it may be demandedwhy we do not attribute infinity to other ideas as well as those of space and duration since they may be as easily and as often repeated in our minds as the other and yet nobody ever thinks of infinite sweetness or infinite whiteness though he can repeat the idea of sweet or white as frequently as those of a yard or a day to which i answerall the ideas that are considered as having parts and are capable of increase by the addition of any equal or less parts afford us by their repetition the idea of infinity because with this endless repetition there is continued an enlargement of which there can be no end but in other ideas it is not so for to the largest idea of extension or duration that i at present have the addition of any the least part makes an increase but to the perfectest idea i have of the whitest whiteness if i add another of a less or equal whiteness and of a whiter than i have i cannot add the idea it makes no increase and enlarges not my idea at all and therefore the different ideas of whiteness c are called degrees for those ideas that consist of parts are capable of being augmented by every addition of the least part but if you take the idea of white which one parcel of snow yielded yesterday to our sight and another idea of white from another parcel of snow you see today and put them together in your mind they embody as it were and run into one and the idea of whiteness is not at all increased and if we add a less degree of whiteness to a greater we are so far from increasing that we diminish it those ideas that consist not of parts cannot be augmented to what proportion men please or be stretched beyond what they have received by their senses but space duration and number being capable of increase by repetition leave in the mind an idea of endless room for more nor can we conceive anywhere a stop to a further addition or progression and so those ideas alone lead our minds towards the thought of infinity difference between infinity of space and space infinite though our idea of infinity arise from the contemplation of quantity and the endless increase the mind is able to make in quantity by the repeated additions of what portions thereof it pleases yet i guess we cause great confusion in our thoughts when we join infinity to any supposed idea of quantity the mind can be thought to have and so discourse or reason about an infinite quantity as an infinite space or an infinite duration for as our idea of infinity being as i think an endless growing idea but the idea of any quantity the mind has being at that time terminated in that idea for be it as great as it will it can be no greater than it isto join infinity to it is to adjust a standing measure to a growing bulk and therefore i think it is not an insignificant subtilty if i say that we are carefully to distinguish between the idea of the infinity of space and the idea of a space infinite the first is nothing but a supposed endless progression of the mind over what repeated ideas of space it pleases but to have actually in the mind the idea of a space infinite is to suppose the mind already passed over and actually to have a view of all those repeated ideas of space which an endless repetition can never totally represent to it which carries in it a plain contradiction we have no idea of infinite space this perhaps will be a little plainer if we consider it in numbers the infinity of numbers to the end of whose addition every one perceives there is no approach easily appears to any one that reflects on it but how clear soever this idea of the infinity of number be there is nothing yet more evident than the absurdity of the actual idea of an infinite number whatsoever positive ideas we have in our minds of any space duration or number let them be ever so great they are still finite but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder from which we remove all bounds and wherein we allow the mind an endless progression of thought without ever completing the idea there we have our idea of infinity which though it seems to be pretty clear when we consider nothing else in it but the negation of an end yet when we would frame in our minds the idea of an infinite space or duration that idea is very obscure and confused because it is made up of two parts very different if not inconsistent for let a man frame in his mind an idea of any space or number as great as he will it is plain the mind rests and terminates in that idea which is contrary to the idea of infinity which consists in a supposed endless progression and therefore i think it is that we are so easily confounded when we come to argue and reason about infinite space or duration c because the parts of such an idea not being perceived to be as they are inconsistent the one side or other always perplexes whatever consequences we draw from the other as an idea of motion not passing on would perplex any one who should argue from such an idea which is not better than an idea of motion at rest and such another seems to me to be the idea of a space or which is the same thing a number infinite ie of a space or number which the mind actually has and so views and terminates in and of a space or number which in a constant and endless enlarging and progression it can in thought never attain to for how large soever an idea of space i have in my mind it is no larger than it is that instant that i have it though i be capable the next instant to double it and so on in infinitum for that alone is infinite which has no bounds and that the idea of infinity in which our thoughts can find none number affords us the clearest idea of infinity but of all other ideas it is number as i have said which i think furnishes us with the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity we are capable of for even in space and duration when the mind pursues the idea of infinity it there makes use of the ideas and repetitions of numbers as of millions and millions of miles or years which are so many distinct ideaskept best by number from running into a confused heap wherein the mind loses itself and when it has added together as many millions c as it pleases of known lengths of space or duration the clearest idea it can get of infinity is the confused incomprehensible remainder of endless addible numbers which affords no prospect of stop or boundary our different conceptions of the infinity of number contrasted with those of duration and expansion it will perhaps give us a little further light into the idea we have of infinity and discover to us that it is nothing but the infinity of number applied to determinate parts of which we have in our minds the distinct ideas if we consider that number is not generally thought by us infinite whereas duration and extension are apt to be so which arises from hencethat in number we are at one end as it were for there being in number nothing less than an unit we there stop and are at an end but in addition or increase of number we can set no bounds and so it is like a line whereof one end terminating with us the other is extended still forwards beyond all that we can conceive but in space and duration it is otherwise for in duration we consider it as if this line of number were extended both waysto an unconceivable undeterminate and infinite length which is evident to any one that will but reflect on what consideration he hath of eternity which i suppose will find to be nothing else but the turning this infinity of number both ways a parte ante and a parte post as they speak for when we would consider eternity a parte ante what do we but beginning from ourselves and the present time we are in repeat in our minds the ideas of years or ages or any other assignable portion of duration past with a prospect of proceeding in such addition with all the infinity of number and when we would consider eternity a parte post we just after the same rate begin from ourselves and reckon by multiplied periods yet to come still extending that line of number as before and these two being put together are that infinite duration we call eternity which as we turn our view either way forwards or backwards appears infinite because we still turn that way the infinite end of number ie the power still of adding more how we conceive the infinity of space the same happens also in space wherein conceiving ourselves to be as it were in the centre we do on all sides pursue those indeterminable lines of number and reckoning any way from ourselves a yard mile diameter of the earth or orbis magnusby the infinity of number we add others to them as often as we will and having no more reason to set bounds to those repeated ideas than we have to set bounds to number we have that indeterminable idea of immensity infinite divisibility and since in any bulk of matter our thoughts can never arrive at the utmost divisibility therefore there is an apparent infinity to us also in that which has the infinity also of number but with this differencethat in the former considerations of the infinity of space and duration we only use addition of numbers whereas this is like the division of an unit into its fractions wherein the mind also can proceed in infinitum as well as in the former additions it being indeed but the addition still of new numbers though in the addition of the one we can have no more the positive idea of a space infinitely great than in the division of the other we can have the positive idea of a body infinitely littleour idea of infinity being as i may say a growing or fugitive idea still in a boundless progression that can stop nowhere no positive idea of infinity though it be hard i think to find anyone so absurd as to say he has the positive idea of an actual infinite numberthe infinity whereof lies only in a power still of adding any combination of units to any former number and that as long and as much as one will the like also being in the infinity of space and duration which power leaves always to the mind room for endless additionsyet there be those who imagine they have positive ideas of infinite duration and space it would i think be enough to destroy any such positive idea of infinite to ask him that has itwhether he could add to it or no which would easily show the mistake of such a positive idea we can i think have no positive idea of any space or duration which is not made up of and commensurate to repeated numbers of feet or yards or days and years which are the common measures whereof we have the ideas in our minds and whereby we judge of the greatness of this sort of quantities and therefore since an infinite idea of space or duration must needs be made up of infinite parts it can have no other infinity than that of number capable still of further addition but not an actual positive idea of a number infinite for i think it is evident that the addition of finite things together as are all lengths whereof we have the positive ideas can never otherwise produce the idea of infinite than as number does which consisting of additions of finite units one to another suggests the idea of infinite only by a power we find we have of still increasing the sum and adding more of the same kind without coming one jot nearer the end of such progression how we cannot have a positive idea of infinity in quantity they who would prove their idea of infinite to be positive seem to me to do it by a pleasant argument taken from the negation of an end which being negative the negation of it is positive he that considers that the end is in body but the extremity or superficies of that body will not perhaps be forward to grant that the end is a bare negative and he that perceives the end of his pen is black or white will be apt to think that the end is something more than a pure negation nor is it when applied to duration the bare negation of existence but more properly the last moment of it but if they will have the end to be nothing but the bare negation of existence i am sure they cannot deny but the beginning is the first instant of being and is not by any body conceived to be a bare negation and therefore by their own argument the idea of eternal a parte ante or of a duration without a beginning is but a negative idea what is positive what negative in our idea of infinite the idea of infinite has i confess something of positive in all those things we apply to it when we would think of infinite space or duration we at first step usually make some very large idea as perhaps of millions of ages or miles which possibly we double and multiply several times all that we thus amass together in our thoughts is positive and the assemblage of a great number of positive ideas of space or duration but what still remains beyond this we have no more a positive distinct notion of than a mariner has of the depth of the sea where having let down a large portion of his soundingline he reaches no bottom whereby he knows the depth to be so many fathoms and more but how much the more is he hath no distinct notion at all and could he always supply new line and find the plummet always sink without ever stopping he would be something in the posture of the mind reaching after a complete and positive idea of infinity in which case let this line be ten or ten thousand fathoms long it equally discovers what is beyond it and gives only this confused and comparative idea that this is not all but one may yet go farther so much as the mind comprehends of any space it has a positive idea of but in endeavour ing to make it infiniteit being always enlarging always advancingthe idea is still imperfect and incomplete so much space as the mind takes a view of in its contemplation of greatness is a clear picture and positive in the understanding but infinite is still greater then the idea of so much is positive and clear the idea of greater is also clear but it is but a comparative idea the idea of so much greater as cannot be comprehended and this is plainly negative not positive for he has no positive clear idea of the largeness of any extension which is that sought for in the idea of infinite that has not a comprehensive idea of the dimensions of it and such nobody i think pretends to in what is infinite for to say a man has a positive clear idea of any quantity without knowing how great it is is as reasonable as to say he has the positive clear idea of the number of the sands on the seashore who knows not how many there be but only that they are more than twenty for just such a perfect and positive idea has he of an infinite space or duration who says it is larger than the extent or duration of ten one hundred one thousand or any other number of miles or years whereof he has or can have a positive idea which is all the idea i think we have of infinite so that what lies beyond our positive idea towards infinity lies in obscurity and has the indeterminate confusion of a negative idea wherein i know i neither do nor can comprehend all i would it being too large for a finite and narrow capacity and that cannot but be very far from a positive complete idea wherein the greatest part of what i would comprehend is left out under the undeterminate intimation of being still greater for to say that having in any quantity measured so much or gone so far you are not yet at the end is only to say that that quantity is greater so that the negation of an end in any quantity is in other words only to say that it is bigger and a total negation of an end is but carrying this bigger still with you in all the progressions of your thoughts shall make in quantity and adding this idea of still greater to all the ideas you have or can be supposed to have of quantity now whether such an idea as that be positive i leave any one to consider we have no positive idea of an infinite duration i ask those who say they have a positive idea of eternity whether their idea of duration includes in it succession or not if it does not they ought to show the difference of their notion of duration when applied to an eternal being and to a finite since perhaps there may be others as well as i who will own to them their weakness of understanding in this point and acknowledge that the notion they have of duration forces them to conceive that whatever has duration is of a longer continuance today than it was yesterday if to avoid succession in external existence they return to the punctum stans of the schools i suppose they will thereby very little mend the matter or help us to a more clear and positive idea of infinite duration there being nothing more inconceivable to me than duration without succession besides that punctum stans if it signify anything being not quantum finite or infinite cannot belong to it but if our weak apprehensions cannot separate succession from any duration whatsoever our idea of eternity can be nothing but of infinite succession of moments of duration wherein anything does exist and whether any one has or can have a positive idea of an actual infinite number i leave him to consider till his infinite number be so great that he himself can add no more to it and as long as he can increase it i doubt he himself will think the idea he hath of it a little too scanty for positive infinity no complete idea of eternal being i think it unavoidable for every considering rational creature that will but examine his own or any other existence to have the notion of an eternal wise being who had no beginning and such an idea of infinite duration i am sure i have but this negation of a beginning being but the negation of a positive thing scarce gives me a positive idea of infinity which whenever i endeavour to extend my thoughts to i confess myself at a loss and i find i cannot attain any clear comprehension of it no positive idea of infinite space he that thinks he has a positive idea of infinite space will when he considers it find that he can no more have a positive idea of the greatest than he has of the least space for in this latter which seems the easier of the two and more within our comprehension we are capable only of a comparative idea of smallness which will always be less than any one whereof we have the positive idea all our positive ideas of any quantity whether great or little have always bounds though our comparative idea whereby we can always add to the one and take from the other hath no bounds for that which remains either great or little not being comprehended in that positive idea which we have lies in obscurity and we have no other idea of it but of the power of enlarging the one and diminishing the other without ceasing a pestle and mortar will as soon bring any particle of matter to indivisibility as the acutest thought of a mathematician and a surveyor may as soon with his chain measure out infinite space as a philosopher by the quickest flight of mind reach it or by thinking comprehend it which is to have a positive idea of it he that thinks on a cube of an inch diameter has a clear and positive idea of it in his mind and so can frame one of and so on till he has the idea in his thoughts of something very little but yet reaches not the idea of that incomprehensible littleness which division can produce what remains of smallness is as far from his thoughts as when he first began and therefore he never comes at all to have a clear and positive idea of that smallness which is consequent to infinite divisibility what is positive what negative in our idea of infinite every one that looks towards infinity does as i have said at first glance make some very large idea of that which he applies it to let it be space or duration and possibly he wearies his thoughts by multiplying in his mind that first large idea but yet by that he comes no nearer to the having a positive clear idea of what remains to make up a positive infinite than the country fellow had of the water which was yet to come and pass the channel of the river where he stood rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis at ille labitur et labetur in omne volubilis oevum some think they have a positive idea of eternity and not of infinite space there are some i have met that put so much difference between infinite duration and infinite space that they persuade themselves that they have a positive idea of eternity but that they have not nor can have any idea of infinite space the reason of which mistake i suppose to be thisthat finding by a due contemplation of causes and effects that it is necessary to admit some eternal being and so to consider the real existence of that being as taken up and commensurate to their idea of eternity but on the other side not finding it necessary but on the contrary apparently absurd that body should be infinite they forwardly conclude that they can have no idea of infinite space because they can have no idea of infinite matter which consequence i conceive is very ill collected because the existence of matter is no ways necessary to the existence of space no more than the existence of motion or the sun is necessary to duration though duration used to be measured by it and i doubt not but that a man may have the idea of ten thousand miles square without any body so big as well as the idea of ten thousand years without any body so old it seems as easy to me to have the idea of space empty of body as to think of the capacity of a bushel without corn or the hollow of a nutshell without a kernel in it it being no more necessary that there should be existing a solid body infinitely extended because we have an idea of the infinity of space than it is necessary that the world should be eternal because we have an idea of infinite duration and why should we think our idea of infinite space requires the real existence of matter to support it when we find that we have as clear an idea of an infinite duration to come as we have of infinite duration past though i suppose nobody thinks it conceivable that anything does or has existed in that future duration nor is it possible to join our idea of future duration with present or past existence any more than it is possible to make the ideas of yesterday today and tomorrow to be the same or bring ages past and future together and make them contemporary but if these men are of the mind that they have clearer ideas of infinite duration than of infinite space because it is past doubt that god has existed from all eternity but there is no real matter coextended with infinite space yet those philosophers who are of opinion that infinite space is possessed by gods infinite omnipresence as well as infinite duration by his eternal existence must be allowed to have as clear an idea of infinite space as of infinite duration though neither of them i think has any positive idea of infinity in either case for whatsoever positive ideas a man has in his mind of any quantity he can repeat it and add it to the former as easy as he can add together the ideas of two days or two paces which are positive ideas of lengths he has in his mind and so on as long as he pleases whereby if a man had a positive idea of infinite either duration or space he could add two infinities together nay make one infinite infinitely bigger than anotherabsurdities too gross to be confuted supposed positive ideas of infinity cause of mistakes but yet if after all this there be men who persuade themselves that they have clear positive comprehensive ideas of infinity it is fit they enjoy their privilege and i should be very glad with some others that i know who acknowledge they have none such to be better informed by their communication for i have been hitherto apt to think that the great and inextricable difficulties which perpetually involve all discourses concerning infinitywhether of space duration or divisibility have been the certain marks of a defect in our ideas of infinity and the disproportion the nature thereof has to the comprehension of our narrow capacities for whilst men talk and dispute of infinite space or duration as if they had as complete and positive ideas of them as they have of the names they use for them or as they have of a yard or an hour or any other determinate quantity it is no wonder if the incomprehensible nature of the thing they discourse of or reason about leads them into perplexities and contradictions and their minds be overlaid by an object too large and mighty to be surveyed and managed by them all these are modes of ideas got from sensation and reflection if i have dwelt pretty long on the consideration of duration space and number and what arises from the contemplation of theminfinity it is possibly no more than the matter requires there being few simple ideas whose modes give more exercise to the thoughts of men than those do i pretend not to treat of them in their full latitude it suffices to my design to show how the mind receives them such as they are from sensation and reflection and how even the idea we have of infinity how remote soever it may seem to be from any object of sense or operation of our mind has nevertheless as all our other ideas its original there some mathematicians perhaps of advanced speculations may have other ways to introduce into their minds ideas of infinity but this hinders not but that they themselves as well as all other men got the first ideas which they had of infinity from sensation and reflection in the method we have here set down other simple modes other simple modes of simple ideas of sensation though i have in the foregoing chapters shown how from simple ideas taken in by sensation the mind comes to extend itself even to infinity which however it may of all others seem most remote from any sensible perception yet at last hath nothing in it but what is made out of simple ideas received into the mind by the senses and afterwards there put together by the faculty the mind has to repeat its own ideasthough i say these might be instances enough of simple modes of the simple ideas of sensation and suffice to show how the mind comes by them yet i shall for methods sake though briefly give an account of some few more and then proceed to more complex ideas simple modes of motion to slide roll tumble walk creep run dance leap skip and abundance of others that might be named are words which are no sooner heard but every one who understands english has presently in his mind distinct ideas which are all but the different modifications of motion modes of motion answer those of extension swift and slow are two different ideas of motion the measures whereof are made of the distances of time and space put together so they are complex ideas comprehending time and space with motion modes of sounds the like variety have we in sounds every articulate word is a different modification of sound by which we see that from the sense of hearing by such modifications the mind may be furnished with distinct ideas to almost an infinite number sounds also besides the distinct cries of birds and beasts are modified by diversity of notes of different length put together which make that complex idea called a tune which a musician may have in his mind when he hears or makes no sound at all by reflecting on the ideas of those sounds so put together silently in his own fancy modes of colours those of colours are also very various some we take notice of as the different degrees or as they were termed shades of the same colour but since we very seldom make assemblages of colours either for use or delight but figure is taken in also and has its part in it as in painting weaving needleworks c those which are taken notice of do most commonly belong to mixed modes as being made up of ideas of divers kinds viz figure and colour such as beauty rainbow c modes of tastes all compounded tastes and smells are also modes made up of the simple ideas of those senses but they being such as generally we have no names for are less taken notice of and cannot be set down in writing and therefore must be left without enumeration to the thoughts and experience of my reader some simple modes have no names in general it may be observed that those simple modes which are considered but as different degrees of the same simple idea though they are in themselves many of them very distinct ideas yet have ordinarily no distinct names nor are much taken notice of as distinct ideas where the difference is but very small between them whether men have neglected these modes and given no names to them as wanting measures nicely to distinguish them or because when they were so distinguished that knowledge would not be of general or necessary use i leave it to the thoughts of others it is sufficient to my purpose to show that all our simple ideas come to our minds only by sensation and reflection and that when the mind has them it can variously repeat and compound them and so make new complex ideas but though white red or sweet c have not been modified or made into complex ideas by several combinations so as to be named and thereby ranked into species yet some others of the simple ideas viz those of unity duration and motion c above instanced in as also power and thinking have been thus modified to a great variety of complex ideas with names belonging to them why some modes have and others have not names the reason whereof i suppose has been thisthat the great concernment of men being with men one amongst another the knowledge of men and their actions and the signifying of them to one another was most necessary and therefore they made ideas of actions very nicely modified and gave those complex ideas names that they might the more easily record and discourse of those things they were daily conversant in without long ambages and circumlocutions and that the things they were continually to give and receive information about might be the easier and quicker understood that this is so and that men in framing different complex ideas and giving them names have been much governed by the end of speech in general which is a very short and expedite way of conveying their thoughts one to another is evident in the names which in several arts have been found out and applied to several complex ideas of modified actions belonging to their several trades for dispatch sake in their direction or discourses about them which ideas are not generally framed in the minds of men not conversant about these operations and thence the words that stand for them by the greatest part of men of the same language are not understood vg coltshire drilling filtration cohobation are words standing for certain complex ideas which being seldom in the minds of any but those few whose particular employments do at every turn suggest them to their thoughts those names of them are not generally understood but by smiths and chymists who having framed the complex ideas which these words stand for and having given names to them or received them from others upon hearing of these names in communication readily conceive those ideas in their mindsas by cohobation all the simple ideas of distilling and the pouring the liquor distilled from anything back upon the remaining matter and distilling it again thus we see that there are great varieties of simple ideas as of tastes and smells which have no names and of modes many more which either not having been generally enough observed or else not being of any great use to be taken notice of in the affairs and converse of men they have not had names given to them and so pass not for species this we shall have occasion hereafter to consider more at large when we come to speak of words of the modes of thinking sensation remembrance contemplation c modes of thinking when the mind turns its view inwards upon itself and contemplates its own actions thinking is the first that occurs in it the mind observes a great variety of modifications and from thence receives distinct ideas thus the perception or thought which actually accompanies and is annexed to any impression on the body made by an external object being distinct from all other modifications of thinking furnishes the mind with a distinct idea which we call sensationwhich is as it were the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by the senses the same idea when it again recurs without the operation of the like object on the external sensory is remembrance if it be sought after by the mind and with pain and endeavour found and brought again in view it is recollection if it be held there long under attentive consideration it is contemplation when ideas float in our mind without any reflection or regard of the understanding it is that which the french call reverie our language has scarce a name for it when the ideas that offer themselves for as i have observed in another place whilst we are awake there will always be a train of ideas succeeding one an other in our minds are taken notice of and as it were registered in the memory it is attention when the mind with great earnestness and of choice fixes its view on any idea considers it on all sides and will not be called off by the ordinary solicitation of other ideas it is that we call intention or study sleep without dreaming is rest from all these and dreaming itself is the having of ideas whilst the outward senses are stopped so that they receive not outward objects with their usual quickness in the mind not suggested by any external objects or known occasion nor under any choice or conduct of the understanding at all and whether that which we call ecstasy be not dreaming with the eyes open i leave to be examined other modes of thinking these are some few instances of those various modes of thinking which the mind may observe in itself and so have as distinct ideas of as it hath of white and red a square or a circle i do not pretend to enumerate them all nor to treat at large of this set of ideas which are got from reflection that would be to make a volume it suffices to my present purpose to have shown here by some few examples of what sort these ideas are and how the mind comes by them especially since i shall have occasion hereafter to treat more at large of reasoning judging volition and knowledge which are some of the most considerable operations of the mind and modes of thinking the various degrees of attention in thinking but perhaps it may not be an unpardonable digression nor wholly impertinent to our present design if we reflect here upon the different state of the mind in thinking which those instances of attention reverie and dreaming c before mentioned naturally enough suggest that there are ideas some or other always present in the mind of a waking man every ones experience convinces him though the mind employs itself about them with several degrees of attention sometimes the mind fixes itself with so much earnestness on the contemplation of some objects that it turns their ideas on all sides marks their relations and circumstances and views every part so nicely and with such intention that it shuts out all other thoughts and takes no notice of the ordinary impressions made then on the senses which at another season would produce very sensible perceptions at other times it barely observes the train of ideas that succeed in the understanding without directing and pursuing any of them and at other times it lets them pass almost quite unregarded as faint shadows that make no impression hence it is probable that thinking is the action not the essence of the soul this difference of intention and remission of the mind in thinking with a great variety of degrees between earnest study and very near minding nothing at all every one i think has experimented in himself trace it a little further and you find the mind in sleep retired as it were from the senses and out of the reach of those motions made on the organs of sense which at other times produce very vivid and sensible ideas i need not for this instance in those who sleep out whole stormy nights without hearing the thunder or seeing the lightning or feeling the shaking of the house which are sensible enough to those who are waking but in this retirement of the mind from the senses it often retains a yet more loose and incoherent manner of thinking which we call dreaming and last of all sound sleep closes the scene quite and puts an end to all appearances this i think almost every one has experience of in himself and his own observation without difficulty leads him thus far that which i would further conclude from hence is that since the mind can sensibly put on at several times several degrees of thinking and be sometimes even in a waking man so remiss as to have thoughts dim and obscure to that degree that they are very little removed from none at all and at last in the dark retirements of sound sleep loses the sight perfectly of all ideas whatsoever since i say this is evidently so in matter of fact and constant experience i ask whether it be not probable that thinking is the action and not the essence of the soul since the operations of agents will easily admit of intention and remission but the essences of things are not conceived capable of any such variation but this by the by of modes of pleasure and pain pleasure and pain simple ideas amongst the simple ideas which we receive both from sensation and reflection pain and pleasure are two very considerable ones for as in the body there is sensation barely in itself or accompanied with pain or pleasure so the thought or perception of the mind is simply so or else accompanied also with pleasure or pain delight or trouble call it how you please these like other simple ideas cannot be described nor their names defined the way of knowing them is as of the simple ideas of the senses only by experience for to define them by the presence of good or evil is no otherwise to make them known to us than by making us reflect on what we feel in ourselves upon the several and various operations of good and evil upon our minds as they are differently applied to or considered by us good and evil what things then are good or evil only in reference to pleasure or pain that we call good which is apt to cause or increase pleasure or diminish pain in us or else to procure or preserve us the possession of any other good or absence of any evil and on the contrary we name that evil which is apt to produce or increase any pain or diminish any pleasure in us or else to procure us any evil or deprive us of any good by pleasure and pain i must be understood to mean of body or mind as they are commonly distinguished though in truth they be only different constitutions of the mind sometimes occasioned by disorder in the body sometimes by thoughts of the mind our passions moved by good and evil pleasure and pain and that which causes themgood and evil are the hinges on which our passions turn and if we reflect on ourselves and observe how these under various considerations operate in us what modifications or tempers of mind what internal sensations if i may so call them they produce in us we may thence form to ourselves the ideas of our passions love thus any one reflecting upon the thought he has of the delight which any present or absent thing is apt to produce in him has the idea we call love for when a man declares in autumn when he is eating them or in spring when there are none that he loves grapes it is no more but that the taste of grapes delights him let an alteration of health or constitution destroy the delight of their taste and he then can be said to love grapes no longer hatred on the contrary the thought of the pain which anything present or absent is apt to produce in us is what we call hatred were it my business here to inquire any further than into the bare ideas of our passions as they depend on different modifications of pleasure and pain i should remark that our love and hatred of inanimate insensible beings is commonly founded on that pleasure and pain which we receive from their use and application any way to our senses though with their destruction but hatred or love to beings capable of happiness or misery is often the uneasiness or delight which we find in ourselves arising from a consideration of their very being or happiness thus the being and welfare of a mans children or friends producing constant delight in him he is said constantly to love them but it suffices to note that our ideas of love and hatred are but the dispositions of the mind in respect of pleasure and pain in general however caused in us desire the uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence of anything whose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it is that we call desire which is greater or less as that uneasiness is more or less vehement where by the by it may perhaps be of some use to remark that the chief if not only spur to human industry and action is uneasiness for whatsoever good is proposed if its absence carries no displeasure or pain with it if a man be easy and content without it there is no desire of it nor endeavour after it there is no more but a bare velleity the term used to signify the lowest degree of desire and that which is next to none at all when there is so little uneasiness in the absence of anything that it carries a man no further than some faint wishes for it without any more effectual or vigorous use of the means to attain it desire also is stopped or abated by the opinion of the im possibility or unattainableness of the good proposed as far as the uneasiness is cured or allayed by that consideration this might carry our thoughts further were it seasonable in this place joy is a delight of the mind from the consideration of the present or assured approaching possession of a good and we are then possessed of any good when we have it so in our power that we can use it when we please thus a man almost starved has joy at the arrival of relief even before he has the pleasure of using it and a father in whom the very wellbeing of his children causes delight is always as long as his children are in such a state in the possession of that good for he needs but to reflect on it to have that pleasure sorrow is uneasiness in the mind upon the thought of a good lost which might have been enjoyed longer or the sense of a present evil hope is that pleasure in the mind which every one finds in himself upon the thought of a probable future enjoyment of a thing which is apt to delight him fear is an uneasiness of the mind upon the thought of future evil likely to befal us despair is the thought of the unattainableness of any good which works differently in mens minds sometimes producing uneasiness or pain sometimes rest and indolency anger is uneasiness or discomposure of the mind upon the receipt of any injury with a present purpose of revenge envy is an uneasiness of the mind caused by the consideration of a good we desire obtained by one we think should not have had it before us what passions all men have these two last envy and anger not being caused by pain and pleasure simply in themselves but having in them some mixed considerations of ourselves and others are not therefore to be found in all men because those other parts of valuing their merits or intending revenge is wanting in them but all the rest terminating purely in pain and pleasure are i think to be found in all men for we love desire rejoice and hope only in respect of pleasure we hate fear and grieve only in respect of pain ultimately in fine all these passions are moved by things only as they appear to be the causes of pleasure and pain or to have pleasure or pain some way or other annexed to them thus we extend our hatred usually to the subject at least if a sensible or voluntary agent which has produced pain in us because the fear it leaves is a constant pain but we do not so constantly love what has done us good because pleasure operates not so strongly on us as pain and because we are not so ready to have hope it will do so again but this by the by pleasure and pain what by pleasure and pain delight and uneasiness i must all along be understood as i have above intimated to mean not only bodily pain and pleasure but whatsoever delight or uneasiness is felt by us whether arising from any grateful or unacceptable sensation or reflection removal or lessening of either it is further to be considered that in reference to the passions the removal or lessening of a pain is considered and operates as a pleasure and the loss or diminishing of a pleasure as a pain shame the passions too have most of them in most persons operations on the body and cause various changes in it which not being always sensible do not make a necessary part of the idea of each passion for shame which is an uneasiness of the mind upon the thought of having done something which is indecent or will lessen the valued esteem which others have for us has not always blushing accompanying it these instances to show how our ideas of the passions are got from sensation and reflection i would not be mistaken here as if i meant this as a discourse of the passions they are many more than those i have here named and those i have taken notice of would each of them require a much larger and more accurate discourse i have only mentioned these here as so many instances of modes of pleasure and pain resulting in our minds from various considerations of good and evil i might perhaps have instanced in other modes of pleasure and pain more simple than these as the pain of hunger and thirst and the pleasure of eating and drinking to remove them the pain of teeth set on edge the pleasure of music pain from captious uninstructive wrangling and the pleasure of rational conversation with a friend or of welldirected study in the search and discovery of truth but the passions being of much more concernment to us i rather made choice to instance in them and show how the ideas we have of them are derived from sensation or reflection of power this idea how got the mind being every day informed by the senses of the alteration of those simple ideas it observes in things without and taking notice how one comes to an end and ceases to be and another begins to exist which was not before reflecting also on what passes within itself and observing a constant change of its ideas sometimes by the impression of outward objects on the senses and sometimes by the determination of its own choice and concluding from what it has so constantly observed to have been that the like changes will for the future be made in the same things by like agents and by the like waysconsiders in one thing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed and in another the possibility of making that change and so comes by that idea which we call power thus we say fire has a power to melt gold ie to destroy the consistency of its insensible parts and consequently its hardness and make it fluid and gold has a power to be melted that the sun has a power to blanch wax and wax a power to be blanched by the sun whereby the yellowness is destroyed and whiteness made to exist in its room in which and the like cases the power we consider is in reference to the change of perceivable ideas for we cannot observe any alteration to be made in or operation upon anything but by the observable change of its sensible ideas nor conceive any alteration to be made but by conceiving a change of some of its ideas power active and passive power thus considered is twofold viz as able to make or able to receive any change the one may be called active and the other passive power whether matter be not wholly destitute of active power as its author god is truly above all passive power and whether the intermediate state of created spirits be not that alone which is capable of both active and passive power may be worth consideration i shall not now enter into that inquiry my present business being not to search into the original of power but how we come by the idea of it but since active powers make so great a part of our complex ideas of natural substances as we shall see hereafter and i mention them as such according to common apprehension yet they being not perhaps so truly active powers as our hasty thoughts are apt to represent them i judge it not amiss by this intimation to direct our minds to the consideration of god and spirits for the clearest idea of active power power includes relation i confess power includes in it some kind of relation a relation to action or change as indeed which of our ideas of what kind soever when attentively considered does not for our ideas of extension duration and number do they not all contain in them a secret relation of the parts figure and motion have something relative in them much more visibly and sensible qualities as colours and smells c what are they but the powers of different bodies in relation to our perception c and if considered in the things themselves do they not depend on the bulk figure texture and motion of the parts all which include some kind of relation in them our idea therefore of power i think may well have a place amongst other simple ideas and be considered as one of them being one of those that make a principal ingredient in our complex ideas of substances as we shall hereafter have occasion to observe the clearest idea of active power had from spirit we are abundantly furnished with the idea of passive power by almost all sorts of sensible things in most of them we cannot avoid observing their sensible qualities nay their very substances to be in a continual flux and therefore with reason we look on them as liable still to the same change nor have we of active power which is the more proper signification of the word power fewer instances since whatever change is observed the mind must collect a power somewhere able to make that change as well as a possibility in the thing itself to receive it but yet if we will consider it attentively bodies by our senses do not afford us so clear and distinct an idea of active power as we have from reflection on the operations of our minds for all power relating to action and there being but two sorts of action whereof we have an idea viz thinking and motion let us consider whence we have the clearest ideas of the powers which produce these actions of thinking body affords us no idea at all it is only from reflection that we have that neither have we from body any idea of the beginning of motion a body at rest affords us no idea of any active power to move and when it is set in motion itself that motion is rather a passion than an action in it for when the ball obeys the motion of a billiardstick it is not any action of the ball but bare passion also when by impulse it sets another ball in motion that lay in its way it only communicates the motion it had received from another and loses in itself so much as the other received which gives us but a very obscure idea of an active power of moving in body whilst we observe it only to transfer but not produce any motion for it is but a very obscure idea of power which reaches not the production of the action but the continuation of the passion for so is motion in a body impelled by another the continuation of the alteration made in it from rest to motion being little more an action than the continuation of the alteration of its figure by the same blow is an action the idea of the beginning of motion we have only from reflection on what passes in ourselves where we find by experience that barely by willing it barely by a thought of the mind we can move the parts of our bodies which were before at rest so that it seems to me we have from the observation of the operation of bodies by our senses but a very imperfect obscure idea of active power since they afford us not any idea in themselves of the power to begin any action either motion or thought but if from the impulse bodies are observed to make one upon another any one thinks he has a clear idea of power it serves as well to my purpose sensation being one of those ways whereby the mind comes by its ideas only i thought it worth while to consider here by the way whether the mind doth not receive its idea of active power clearer from reflection on its own operations than it doth from any external sensation will and understanding two powers in mind or spirit this at least i think evidentthat we find in ourselves a power to begin or forbear continue or end several actions of our minds and motions of our bodies barely by a thought or preference of the mind ordering or as it were commanding the doing or not doing such or such a particular action this power which the mind has thus to order the consideration of any idea or the forbearing to consider it or to prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest and vice versa in any particular instance is that which we call the will the actual exercise of that power by directing any particular action or its forbearance is that which we call volition or willing the forbearance of that action consequent to such order or command of the mind is called voluntary and whatsoever action is performed without such a thought of the mind is called involuntary the power of perception is that which we call the understanding perception which we make the act of the understanding is of three sorts the perception of ideas in our minds the perception of the signification of signs the perception of the connexion or repugnancy agreement or disagreement that there is between any of our ideas all these are attributed to the understanding or perceptive power though it be the two latter only that use allows us to say we understand faculties not real beings these powers of the mind viz of perceiving and of preferring are usually called by another name and the ordinary way of speaking is that the understanding and will are two faculties of the mind a word proper enough if it be used as all words should be so as not to breed any confusion in mens thoughts by being supposed as i suspect it has been to stand for some real beings in the soul that performed those actions of understanding and volition for when we say the will is the commanding and superior faculty of the soul that it is or is not free that it determines the inferior faculties that it follows the dictates of the understanding cthough these and the like expressions by those that carefully attend to their own ideas and conduct their thoughts more by the evidence of things than the sound of words may be understood in a clear and distinct senseyet i suspect i say that this way of speaking of faculties has misled many into a confused notion of so many distinct agents in us which had their several provinces and authorities and did command obey and perform several actions as so many distinct beings which has been no small occasion of wrangling obscurity and uncertainty in questions relating to them whence the ideas of liberty and necessity every one i think finds in himself a power to begin or forbear continue or put an end to several actions in himself from the consideration of the extent of this power of the mind over the actions of the man which everyone finds in himself arise the ideas of liberty and necessity liberty what all the actions that we have any idea of reducing themselves as has been said to these two viz thinking and motion so far as a man has power to think or not to think to move or not to move according to the preference or direction of his own mind so far is a man free wherever any performance or forbearance are not equally in a mans power wherever doing or not doing will not equally follow upon the preference of his mind directing it there he is not free though perhaps the action may be voluntary so that the idea of liberty is the idea of a power in any agent to do or forbear any particular action according to the determination or thought of the mind whereby either of them is preferred to the other where either of them is not in the power of the agent to be produced by him according to his volition there he is not at liberty that agent is under necessity so that liberty cannot be where there is no thought no volition no will but there may be thought there may be will there may be volition where there is no liberty a little consideration of an obvious instance or two may make this clear supposes understanding and will a tennisball whether in motion by the stroke of a racket or lying still at rest is not by any one taken to be a free agent if we inquire into the reason we shall find it is because we conceive not a tennisball to think and consequently not to have any volition or preference of motion to rest or vice versa and therefore has not liberty is not a free agent but all its both motion and rest come under our idea of necessary and are so called likewise a man falling into the water a bridge breaking under him has not herein liberty is not a free agent for though he has volition though he prefers his not falling to falling yet the forbearance of that motion not being in his power the stop or cessation of that motion follows not upon his volition and therefore therein he is not free so a man striking himself or his friend by a convulsive motion of his arm which it is not in his power by volition or the direction of his mind to stop or forbear nobody thinks he has in this liberty every one pities him as acting by necessity and constraint belongs not to volition again suppose a man be carried whilst fast asleep into a room where is a person he longs to see and speak with and be there locked fast in beyond his power to get out he awakes and is glad to find himself in so desirable company which he stays willingly in ie prefers his stay to going away i ask is not this stay voluntary i think nobody will doubt it and yet being locked fast in it is evident he is not at liberty not to stay he has not freedom to be gone so that liberty is not an idea belonging to volition or preferring but to the person having the power of doing or forbearing to do according as the mind shall choose or direct our idea of liberty reaches as far as that power and no farther for wherever restraint comes to check that power or compulsion takes away that indifferency of ability to act or to forbear acting there liberty and our notion of it presently ceases voluntary opposed to involuntary not to necessary we have instances enough and often more than enough in our own bodies a mans heart beats and the blood circulates which it is not in his power by any thought or volition to stop and therefore in respect of these motions where rest depends not on his choice nor would follow the determination of his mind if it should prefer it he is not a free agent convulsive motions agitate his legs so that though he wills it ever so much he cannot by any power of his mind stop their motion as in that odd disease called chorea sancti viti but he is perpetually dancing he is not at liberty in this action but under as much necessity of moving as a stone that falls or a tennisball struck with a racket on the other side a palsy or the stocks hinder his legs from obeying the determination of his mind if it would thereby transfer his body to another place in all these there is want of freedom though the sitting still even of a paralytic whilst he prefers it to a removal is truly voluntary voluntary then is not opposed to necessary but to involuntary for a man may prefer what he can do to what he cannot do the state he is in to its absence or change though necessity has made it in itself unalterable liberty what as it is in the motions of the body so it is in the thoughts of our minds where any one is such that we have power to take it up or lay it by according to the preference of the mind there we are at liberty a waking man being under the necessity of having some ideas constantly in his mind is not at liberty to think or not to think no more than he is at liberty whether his body shall touch any other or no but whether he will remove his contemplation from one idea to another is many times in his choice and then he is in respect of his ideas as much at liberty as he is in respect of bodies he rests on he can at pleasure remove himself from one to another but yet some ideas to the mind like some motions to the body are such as in certain circumstances it cannot avoid nor obtain their absence by the utmost effort it can use a man on the rack is not at liberty to lay by the idea of pain and divert himself with other contemplations and sometimes a boisterous passion hurries our thoughts as a hurricane does our bodies without leaving us the liberty of thinking on other things which we would rather choose but as soon as the mind regains the power to stop or continue begin or forbear any of these motions of the body without or thoughts within according as it thinks fit to prefer either to the other we then consider the man as a free agent again necessity what wherever thought is wholly wanting or the power to act or forbear according to the direction of thought there necessity takes place this in an agent capable of volition when the beginning or continuation of any action is contrary to that preference of his mind is called compulsion when the hindering or stopping any action is contrary to his volition it is called restraint agents that have no thought no volition at all are in everything necessary agents liberty belongs not to the will if this be so as i imagine it is i leave it to be considered whether it may not help to put an end to that long agitated and i think unreasonable because unintelligible question viz whether mans will be free or no for if i mistake not it follows from what i have said that the question itself is altogether improper and it is as insignificant to ask whether mans will be free as to ask whether his sleep be swift or his virtue square liberty being as little applicable to the will as swiftness of motion is to sleep or squareness to virtue every one would laugh at the absurdity of such a question as either of these because it is obvious that the modifications of motion belong not to sleep nor the difference of figure to virtue and when one well considers it i think he will as plainly perceive that liberty which is but a power belongs only to agents and cannot be an attribute or modification of the will which is also but a power volition such is the difficulty of explaining and giving clear notions of internal actions by sounds that i must here warn my reader that ordering directing choosing preferring c which i have made use of will not distinctly enough express volition unless he will reflect on what he himself does when he wills for example preferring which seems perhaps best to express the act of volition does it not precisely for though a man would prefer flying to walking yet who can say he ever wills it volition it is plain is an act of the mind knowingly exerting that dominion it takes itself to have over any part of the man by employing it in or withholding it from any particular action and what is the will but the faculty to do this and is that faculty anything more in effect than a power the power of the mind to determine its thought to the producing continuing or stopping any action as far as it depends on us for can it be denied that whatever agent has a power to think on its own actions and to prefer their doing or omission either to other has that faculty called will will then is nothing but such a power liberty on the other side is the power a man has to do or forbear doing any particular action according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in the mind which is the same thing as to say according as he himself wills it powers belonging to agents it is plain then that the will is nothing but one power or ability and freedom another power or ability so that to ask whether the will has freedom is to ask whether one power has another power one ability another ability a question at first sight too grossly absurd to make a dispute or need an answer for who is it that sees not that powers belong only to agents and are attributes only of substances and not of powers themselves so that this way of putting the question viz whether the will be free is in effect to ask whether the will be a substance an agent or at least to suppose it since freedom can properly be attributed to nothing else if freedom can with any propriety of speech be applied to power it may be attributed to the power that is in a man to produce or forbear producing motion in parts of his body by choice or preference which is that which denominates him free and is freedom itself but if any one should ask whether freedom were free he would be suspected not to understand well what he said and he would be thought to deserve midass ears who knowing that rich was a denomination for the possession of riches should demand whether riches themselves were rich how the will instead of the man is called free however the name faculty which men have given to this power called the will and whereby they have been led into a way of talking of the will as acting may by an appropriation that disguises its true sense serve a little to palliate the absurdity yet the will in truth signifies nothing but a power or ability to prefer or choose and when the will under the name of a faculty is considered as it is barely as an ability to do something the absurdity in saying it is free or not free will easily discover itself for if it be reasonable to suppose and talk of faculties as distinct beings that can act as we do when we say the will orders and the will is free it is fit that we should make a speaking faculty and a walking faculty and a dancing faculty by which these actions are produced which are but several modes of motion as well as we make the will and understanding to be faculties by which the actions of choosing and perceiving are produced which are but several modes of thinking and we may as properly say that it is the singing faculty sings and the dancing faculty dances as that the will chooses or that the understanding conceives or as is usual that the will directs the understanding or the understanding obeys or obeys not the will it being altogether as proper and intelligible to say that the power of speaking directs the power of singing or the power of singing obeys or disobeys the power of speaking this way of talking causes confusion of thought this way of talking nevertheless has prevailed and as i guess produced great confusion for these being all different powers in the mind or in the man to do several actions he exerts them as he thinks fit but the power to do one action is not operated on by the power of doing another action for the power of thinking operates not on the power of choosing nor the power of choosing on the power of thinking no more than the power of dancing operates on the power of singing or the power of singing on the power of dancing as any one who reflects on it will easily perceive and yet this is it which we say when we thus speak that the will operates on the understanding or the understanding on the will powers are relations not agents i grant that this or that actual thought may be the occasion of volition or exercising the power a man has to choose or the actual choice of the mind the cause of actual thinking on this or that thing as the actual singing of such a tune may be the cause of dancing such a dance and the actual dancing of such a dance the occasion of singing such a tune but in all these it is not one power that operates on another but it is the mind that operates and exerts these powers it is the man that does the action it is the agent that has power or is able to do for powers are relations not agents and that which has the power or not the power to operate is that alone which is or is not free and not the power itself for freedom or not freedom can belong to nothing but what has or has not a power to act liberty belongs not to the will the attributing to faculties that which belonged not to them has given occasion to this way of talking but the introducing into discourses concerning the mind with the name of faculties a notion of their operating has i suppose as little advanced our knowledge in that part of ourselves as the great use and mention of the like invention of faculties in the operations of the body has helped us in the knowledge of physic not that i deny there are faculties both in the body and mind they both of them have their powers of operating else neither the one nor the other could operate for nothing can operate that is not able to operate and that is not able to operate that has no power to operate nor do i deny that those words and the like are to have their place in the common use of languages that have made them current it looks like too much affectation wholly to lay them by and philosophy itself though it likes not a gaudy dress yet when it appears in public must have so much complacency as to be clothed in the ordinary fashion and language of the country so far as it can consist with truth and perspicuity but the fault has been that faculties have been spoken of and represented as so many distinct agents for it being asked what it was that digested the meat in our stomachs it was a ready and very satisfactory answer to say that it was the digestive faculty what was it that made anything come out of the body the expulsive faculty what moved the motive faculty and so in the mind the intellectual faculty or the understanding understood and the elective faculty or the will willed or commanded this is in short to say that the ability to digest digested and the ability to move moved and the ability to understand understood for faculty ability and power i think are but different names of the same things which ways of speaking when put into more intelligible words will i think amount to thus muchthat digestion is performed by something that is able to digest motion by something able to move and understanding by something able to understand and in truth it would be very strange if it should be otherwise as strange as it would be for a man to be free without being able to be free but to the agent or man to return then to the inquiry about liberty i think the question is not proper whether the will be free but whether a man be free thus i think first that so far as any one can by the direction or choice of his mind preferring the existence of any action to the nonexistence of that action and vice versa make it to exist or not exist so far he is free for if i can by a thought directing the motion of my finger make it move when it was at rest or vice versa it is evident that in respect of that i am free and if i can by a like thought of my mind preferring one to the other produce either words or silence i am at liberty to speak or hold my peace and as far as this power reaches of acting or not acting by the determination of his own thought preferring either so far is a man free for how can we think any one freer than to have the power to do what he will and so far as any one can by preferring any action to its not being or rest to any action produce that action or rest so far can he do what he will for such a preferring of action to its absence is the willing of it and we can scarce tell how to imagine any being freer than to be able to do what he wills so that in respect of actions within the reach of such a power in him a man seems as free as it is possible for freedom to make him in respect of willing a man is not free but the inquisitive mind of man willing to shift off from himself as far as he can all thoughts of guilt though it be by putting himself into a worse state than that of fatal necessity is not content with this freedom unless it reaches further than this will not serve the turn and it passes for a good plea that a man is not free at all if he be not as free to will as he is to act what he wills concerning a mans liberty there yet therefore is raised this further question whether a man be free to will which i think is what is meant when it is disputed whether the will be free and as to that i imagine how a man cannot be free to will secondly that willing or volition being an action and freedom consisting in a power of acting or not acting a man in respect of willing or the act of volition when any action in his power is once proposed to his thoughts as presently to be done cannot be free the reason whereof is very manifest for it being unavoidable that the action depending on his will should exist or not exist and its existence or not existence following perfectly the determination and preference of his will he cannot avoid willing the existence or nonexistence of that action it is absolutely necessary that he will the one or the other ie prefer the one to the other since one of them must necessarily follow and that which does follow follows by the choice and determination of his mind that is by his willing it for if he did not will it it would not be so that in respect of the act of willing a man in such a case is not free liberty consisting in a power to act or not to act which in regard of volition a man upon such a proposal has not for it is unavoidably necessary to prefer the doing or forbearance of an action in a mans power which is once so proposed to his thoughts a man must necessarily will the one or the other of them upon which preference or volition the action or its forbearance certainly follows and is truly voluntary but the act of volition or preferring one of the two being that which he cannot avoid a man in respect of that act of willing is under a necessity and so cannot be free unless necessity and freedom can consist together and a man can be free and bound at once besides to make a man free after this manner by making the action of willing to depend on his will there must be another antecedent will to determine the acts of this will and another to determine that and so in infinitum for wherever one stops the actions of the last will cannot be free nor is any being as far i can com prehend beings above me capable of such a freedom of will that it can forbear to will ie to prefer the being or not being of anything in its power which it has once considered as such liberty is freedom to execute what is willed this then is evident that a man is not at liberty to will or not to will anything in his power that he once considers of liberty consisting in a power to act or to forbear acting and in that only for a man that sits still is said yet to be at liberty because he can walk if he wills it a man that walks is at liberty also not because he walks or moves but because he can stand still if he wills it but if a man sitting still has not a power to remove himself he is not at liberty so likewise a man falling down a precipice though in motion is not at liberty because he cannot stop that motion if he would this being so it is plain that a man that is walking to whom it is proposed to give off walking is not at liberty whether he will determine himself to walk or give off walking or not he must necessarily prefer one or the other of them walking or not walking and so it is in regard of all other actions in our power so proposed which are the far greater number for considering the vast number of voluntary actions that succeed one another every moment that we are awake in the course of our lives there are but few of them that are thought on or proposed to the will till the time they are to be done and in all such actions as i have shown the mind in respect of willing has not a power to act or not to act wherein consists liberty the mind in that case has not a power to forbear willing it cannot avoid some determination concerning them let the consideration be as short the thought as quick as it will it either leaves the man in the state he was before thinking or changes it continues the action or puts an end to it whereby it is manifest that it orders and directs one in preference to or with neglect of the other and thereby either the continuation or change becomes unavoidably voluntary the will determined by something without it since then it is plain that in most cases a man is not at liberty whether he will or no for when an action in his power is proposed to his thoughts he cannot forbear volition he must determine one way or the other the next thing demanded iswhether a man be at liberty to will which of the two he pleases motion or rest this question carries the absurdity of it so manifestly in itself that one might thereby sufficiently be convinced that liberty concerns not the will for to ask whether a man be at liberty to will either motion or rest speaking or silence which he pleases is to ask whether a man can will what he wills or be pleased with what he is pleased with a question which i think needs no answer and they who can make a question of it must suppose one will to determine the acts of another and another to determine that and so on in infinitum the ideas of liberty and volition must be defined to avoid these and the like absurdities nothing can be of greater use than to establish in our minds determined ideas of the things under consideration if the ideas of liberty and volition were well fixed in our understandings and carried along with us in our minds as they ought through all the questions that are raised about them i suppose a great part of the difficulties that perplex mens thoughts and entangle their understandings would be much easier resolved and we should perceive where the confused signification of terms or where the nature of the thing caused the obscurity freedom first then it is carefully to be remembered that freedom consists in the dependence of the existence or not existence of any action upon our volition of it and not in the dependence of any action or its contrary on our preference a man standing on a cliff is at liberty to leap twenty yards downwards into the sea not because he has a power to do the contrary action which is to leap twenty yards upwards for that he cannot do but he is therefore free because he has a power to leap or not to leap but if a greater force than his either holds him fast or tumbles him down he is no longer free in that case because the doing or forbearance of that particular action is no longer in his power he that is a close prisoner in a room twenty feet square being at the north side of his chamber is at liberty to walk twenty feet southward because he can walk or not walk it but is not at the same time at liberty to do the contrary ie to walk twenty feet northward in this then consists freedom viz in our being able to act or not to act according as we shall choose or will what volition and action mean secondly we must remember that volition or willing is an act of the mind directing its thought to the production of any action and thereby exerting its power to produce it to avoid multiplying of words i would crave leave here under the word action to comprehend the forbearance too of any action proposed sitting still or holding ones peace when walking or speaking are proposed though mere forbearances requiring as much the determination of the will and being as often weighty in their consequences as the contrary actions may on that consideration well enough pass for actions too but this i say that i may not be mistaken if for brevitys sake i speak thus what determines the will thirdly the will being nothing but a power in the mind to direct the operative faculties of a man to motion or rest as far as they depend on such direction to the question what is it determines the will the true and proper answer is the mind for that which determines the general power of directing to this or that particular direction is nothing but the agent itself exercising the power it has that particular way if this answer satisfies not it is plain the meaning of the question what determines the will is thiswhat moves the mind in every particular instance to determine its general power of directing to this or that particular motion or rest and to this i answer the motive for continuing in the same state or action is only the present satisfaction in it the motive to change is always some uneasiness nothing setting us upon the change of state or upon any new action but some uneasiness this is the great motive that works on the mind to put it upon action which for shortness sake we will call determining of the will which i shall more at large explain will and desire must not be confounded but in the way to it it will be necessary to premise that though i have above endeavoured to express the act of volition by choosing preferring and the like terms that signify desire as well as volition for want of other words to mark that act of the mind whose proper name is willing or volition yet it being a very simple act whosoever desires to understand what it is will better find it by reflecting on his own mind and observing what it does when it wills than by any variety of articulate sounds whatsoever this caution of being careful not to be misled by expressions that do not enough keep up the difference between the will and several acts of the mind that are quite distinct from it i think the more necessary because i find the will often confounded with several of the affections especially desire and one put for the other and that by men who would not willingly be thought not to have had very distinct notions of things and not to have writ very clearly about them this i imagine has been no small occasion of obscurity and mistake in this matter and therefore is as much as may be to be avoided for he that shall turn his thoughts inwards upon what passes in his mind when he wills shall see that the will or power of volition is conversant about nothing but our own actions terminates there and reaches no further and that volition is nothing but that particular determination of the mind whereby barely by a thought the mind endeavours to give rise continuation or stop to any action which it takes to be in its power this well considered plainly shows that the will is perfectly distinguished from desire which in the very same action may have a quite contrary tendency from that which our will sets us upon a man whom i cannot deny may oblige me to use persuasions to another which at the same time i am speaking i may wish may not prevail on him in this case it is plain the will and desire run counter i will the action that tends one way whilst my desire tends another and that the direct contrary way a man who by a violent fit of the gout in his limbs finds a doziness in his head or a want of appetite in his stomach removed desires to be eased too of the pain of his feet or hands for wherever there is pain there is a desire to be rid of it though yet whilst he apprehends that the removal of the pain may translate the noxious humour to a more vital part his will is never determined to any one action that may serve to remove this pain whence it is evident that desiring and willing are two distinct acts of the mind and consequently that the will which is but the power of volition is much more distinct from desire uneasiness determines the will to return then to the inquiry what is it that determines the will in regard to our actions and that upon second thoughts i am apt to imagine is not as is generally supposed the greater good in view but some and for the most part the most pressing uneasiness a man is at present under this is that which successively determines the will and sets us upon those actions we perform this uneasiness we may call as it is desire which is an uneasiness of the mind for want of some absent good all pain of the body of what sort soever and disquiet of the mind is uneasiness and with this is always joined desire equal to the pain or uneasiness felt and is scarce distinguishable from it for desire being nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent good in reference to any pain felt ease is that absent good and till that ease be attained we may call it desire nobody feeling pain that he wishes not to be eased of with a desire equal to that pain and inseparable from it besides this desire of ease from pain there is another of absent positive good and here also the desire and uneasiness are equal as much as we desire any absent good so much are we in pain for it but here all absent good does not according to the greatness it has or is acknowledged to have cause pain equal to that greatness as all pain causes desire equal to itself because the absence of good is not always a pain as the presence of pain is and therefore absent good may be looked on and considered without desire but so much as there is anywhere of desire so much there is of uneasiness desire is uneasiness that desire is a state of uneasiness every one who reflects on himself will quickly find who is there that has not felt in desire what the wise man says of hope which is not much different from it that it being deferred makes the heart sick and that still proportionable to the greatness of the desire which sometimes raises the uneasiness to that pitch that it makes people cry out give me children give me the thing desired or i die life itself and all its enjoyments is a burden cannot be borne under the lasting and unremoved pressure of such an uneasiness the uneasiness of desire determines the will good and evil present and absent it is true work upon the mind but that which immediately determines the will from time to time to every voluntary action is the uneasiness of desire fixed on some absent good either negative as indolence to one in pain or positive as enjoyment of pleasure that it is this uneasiness that determines the will to the successive voluntary actions whereof the greatest part of our lives is made up and by which we are conducted through different courses to different ends i shall endeavour to show both from experience and the reason of the thing this is the spring of action when a man is perfectly content with the state he is inwhich is when he is perfectly without any uneasinesswhat industry what action what will is there left but to continue in it of this every mans observation will satisfy him and thus we see our allwise maker suitably to our constitution and frame and knowing what it is that determines the will has put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst and other natural desires that return at their seasons to move and determine their wills for the preservation of themselves and the continuation of their species for i think we may conclude that if the bare contemplation of these good ends to which we are carried by these several uneasinesses had been sufficient to determine the will and set us on work we should have had none of these natural pains and perhaps in this world little or no pain at all it is better to marry than to burn says st paul where we may see what it is that chiefly drives men into the enjoyments of a conjugal life a little burning felt pushes us more powerfully than greater pleasures in prospect draw or allure the greatest positive good determines not the will but present uneasiness alone it seems so established and settled a maxim by the general consent of all mankind that good the greater good determines the will that i do not at all wonder that when i first published my thoughts on this subject i took it for granted and i imagine that by a great many i shall be thought more excusable for having then done so than that now i have ventured to recede from so received an opinion but yet upon a stricter inquiry i am forced to conclude that good the greater good though apprehended and acknowledged to be so does not determine the will until our desire raised proportionably to it makes us uneasy in the want of it convince a man never so much that plenty has its advantages over poverty make him see and own that the handsome conveniences of life are better than nasty penury yet as long as he is content with the latter and finds no uneasiness in it he moves not his will never is determined to any action that shall bring him out of it let a man be ever so well persuaded of the advantages of virtue that it is as necessary to a man who has any great aims in this world or hopes in the next as food to life yet till he hungers or thirsts after righteousness till he feels an uneasiness in the want of it his will will not be determined to any action in pursuit of this confessed greater good but any other uneasiness he feels in himself shall take place and carry his will to other actions on the other side let a drunkard see that his health decays his estate wastes discredit and diseases and the want of all things even of his beloved drink attends him in the course he follows yet the returns of uneasiness to miss his companions the habitual thirst after his cups at the usual time drives him to the tavern though he has in his view the loss of health and plenty and perhaps of the joys of another life the least of which is no inconsiderable good but such as he confesses is far greater than the tickling of his palate with a glass of wine or the idle chat of a soaking club it is not want of viewing the greater good for he sees and acknowledges it and in the intervals of his drinking hours will take resolutions to pursue the greater good but when the uneasiness to miss his accustomed delight returns the great acknowledged good loses its hold and the present uneasiness determines the will to the accustomed action which thereby gets stronger footing to prevail against the next occasion though he at the same time makes secret promises to himself that he will do so no more this is the last time he will act against the attainment of those greater goods and thus he is from time to time in the state of that unhappy complainer video meliora proboque deteriora sequor which sentence allowed for true and made good by constant experience may in this and possibly no other way be easily made intelligible because the removal of uneasiness is the first step to happiness if we inquire into the reason of what experience makes so evident in fact and examine why it is uneasiness alone operates on the will and determines it in its choice we shall find that we being capable but of one determination of the will to one action at once the present uneasiness that we are under does naturally determine the will in order to that happiness which we all aim at in all our actions for as much as whilst we are under any uneasiness we cannot apprehend ourselves happy or in the way to it pain and uneasiness being by every one concluded and felt to be inconsistent with happiness spoiling the relish even of those good things which we have a little pain serving to mar all the pleasure we rejoiced in and therefore that which of course determines the choice of our will to the next action will always bethe removing of pain as long as we have any left as the first and necessary step towards happiness because uneasiness alone is present another reason why it is uneasiness alone determines the will is this because that alone is present and it is against the nature of things that what is absent should operate where it is not it may be said that absent good may by contemplation be brought home to the mind and made present the idea of it indeed may be in the mind and viewed as present there but nothing will be in the mind as a present good able to counterbalance the removal of any uneasiness which we are under till it raises our desire and the uneasiness of that has the prevalency in determining the will till then the idea in the mind of whatever is good is there only like other ideas the object of bare unactive speculation but operates not on the will nor sets us on work the reason whereof i shall show by and by how many are to be found that have had lively representations set before their minds of the unspeakable joys of heaven which they acknowledge both possible and probable too who yet would be content to take up with their happiness here and so the prevailing uneasiness of their desires let loose after the enjoyments of this life take their turns in the determining their wills and all that while they take not one step are not one jot moved towards the good things of another life considered as ever so great because all who allow the joys of heaven possible pursue them not were the will determined by the views of good as it appears in contemplation greater or less to the understanding which is the state of all absent good and that which in the received opinion the will is supposed to move to and to be moved byi do not see how it could ever get loose from the infinite eternal joys of heaven once proposed and considered as possible for all absent good by which alone barely proposed and coming in view the will is thought to be determined and so to set us on action being only possible but not infallibly certain it is unavoidable that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all the successive actions it directs and then we should keep constantly and steadily in our course towards heaven without ever standing still or directing our actions to any other end the eternal condition of a future state infinitely outweighing the expectation of riches or honour or any other worldly pleasure which we can propose to ourselves though we should grant these the more probable to be obtained for nothing future is yet in possession and so the expectation even of these may deceive us if it were so that the greater good in view determines the will so great a good once proposed could not but seize the will and hold it fast to the pursuit of this infinitely greatest good without ever letting it go again for the will having a power over and directing the thoughts as well as other actions would if it were so hold the contemplation of the mind fixed to that good but any great uneasiness is never neglected this would be the state of the mind and regular tendency of the will in all its determinations were it determined by that which is considered and in view the greater good but that it is not so is visible in experience the infinitely greatest confessed good being often neglected to satisfy the successive uneasiness of our desires pursuing trifles but though the greatest allowed even everlasting unspeakable good which has sometimes moved and affected the mind does not stedfastly hold the will yet we see any very great and prevailing uneasiness having once laid hold on the will let it not go by which we may be convinced what it is that determines the will thus any vehement pain of the body the ungovernable passion of a man violently in love or the impatient desire of revenge keeps the will steady and intent and the will thus determined never lets the understanding lay by the object but all the thoughts of the mind and powers of the body are uninterruptedly employed that way by the determination of the will influenced by that topping uneasiness as long as it lasts whereby it seems to me evident that the will or power of setting us upon one action in preference to all others is determined in us by uneasiness and whether this be not so i desire every one to observe in himself desire accompanies all uneasiness i have hitherto chiefly instanced in the uneasiness of desire as that which determines the will because that is the chief and most sensible and the will seldom orders any action nor is there any voluntary action performed without some desire accompanying it which i think is the reason why the will and desire are so often confounded but yet we are not to look upon the uneasiness which makes up or at least accompanies most of the other passions as wholly excluded in the case aversion fear anger envy shame c have each their uneasinesses too and thereby influence the will these passions are scarce any of them in life and practice simple and alone and wholly unmixed with others though usually in discourse and contemplation that carries the name which operates strongest and appears most in the present state of the mind nay there is i think scarce any of the passions to be found without desire joined with it i am sure wherever there is uneasiness there is desire for we constantly desire happiness and whatever we feel of uneasiness so much it is certain we want of happiness even in our own opinion let our state and condition otherwise be what it will besides the present moment not being our eternity whatever our enjoyment be we look beyond the present and desire goes with our foresight and that still carries the will with it so that even in joy itself that which keeps up the action whereon the enjoyment depends is the desire to continue it and fear to lose it and whenever a greater uneasiness than that takes place in the mind the will presently is by that determined to some new action and the present delight neglected the most pressing uneasiness naturally determines the will but we being in this world beset with sundry uneasinesses distracted with different desires the next inquiry naturally will bewhich of them has the precedency in determining the will to the next action and to that the answer isthat ordinarily which is the most pressing of those that are judged capable of being then removed for the will being the power of directing our operative faculties to some action for some end cannot at any time be moved towards what is judged at that time unattainable that would be to suppose an intelligent being designedly to act for an end only to lose its labour for so it is to act for what is judged not attainable and therefore very great uneasinesses move not the will when they are judged not capable of a cure they in that case put us not upon endeavours but these set apart the most important and urgent uneasiness we at that time feel is that which ordinarily determines the will successively in that train of voluntary actions which makes up our lives the greatest present uneasiness is the spur to action that is constantly most felt and for the most part determines the will in its choice of the next action for this we must carry along with us that the proper and only object of the will is some action of ours and nothing else for we producing nothing by our willing it but some action in our power it is there the will terminates and reaches no further all desire happiness if it be further askedwhat it is moves desire i answerhappiness and that alone happiness and misery are the names of two extremes the utmost bounds whereof we know not it is what eye hath not seen ear hath not heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive but of some degrees of both we have very lively impressions made by several instances of delight and joy on the one side and torment and sorrow on the other which for shortness sake i shall comprehend under the names of pleasure and pain there being pleasure and pain of the mind as well as the bodywith him is fulness of joy and pleasure for evermore or to speak truly they are all of the mind though some have their rise in the mind from thought others in the body from certain modifications of motion happiness and misery good and evil what they are happiness then in its full extent is the utmost pleasure we are capable of and misery the utmost pain and the lowest degree of what can be called happiness is so much ease from all pain and so much present pleasure as without which any one cannot be content now because pleasure and pain are produced in us by the operation of certain objects either on our minds or our bodies and in different degrees therefore what has an aptness to produce pleasure in us is that we call good and what is apt to produce pain in us we call evil for no other reason but for its aptness to produce pleasure and pain in us wherein consists our happiness and misery further though what is apt to produce any degree of pleasure be in itself good and what is apt to produce any degree of pain be evil yet it often happens that we do not call it so when it comes in competition with a greater of its sort because when they come in competition the degrees also of pleasure and pain have justly a preference so that if we will rightly estimate what we call good and evil we shall find it lies much in comparison for the cause of every less degree of pain as well as every greater degree of pleasure has the nature of good and vice versa what good is desired what not though this be that which is called good and evil and all good be the proper object of desire in general yet all good even seen and confessed to be so does not necessarily move every particular mans desire but only that part or so much of it as is considered and taken to make a necessary part of his happiness all other good however great in reality or appearance excites not a mans desires who looks not on it to make a part of that happiness wherewith he in his present thoughts can satisfy himself happiness under this view every one constantly pursues and desires what makes any part of it other things acknowledged to be good he can look upon without desire pass by and be content without there is nobody i think so senseless as to deny that there is pleasure in knowledge and for the pleasures of sense they have too many followers to let it be questioned whether men are taken with them or no now let one man place his satisfaction in sensual pleasures another in the delight of knowledge though each of them cannot but confess there is great pleasure in what the other pursues yet neither of them making the others delight a part of his happiness their desires are not moved but each is satisfied without what the other enjoys and so his will is not determined to the pursuit of it but yet as soon as the studious mans hunger and thirst make him uneasy he whose will was never determined to any pursuit of good cheer poignant sauces delicious wine by the pleasant taste he has found in them is by the uneasiness of hunger and thirst presently determined to eating and drinking though possibly with great indifferency what wholesome food comes in his way and on the other side the epicure buckles to study when shame or the desire to recommend himself to his mistress shall make him uneasy in the want of any sort of knowledge thus how much soever men are in earnest and constant in pursuit of happiness yet they may have a clear view of good great and confessed good without being concerned for it or moved by it if they think they can make up their happiness without it though as to pain that they are always concerned for they can feel no uneasiness without being moved and therefore being uneasy in the want of whatever is judged necessary to their happiness as soon as any good appears to make a part of their portion of happiness they begin to desire it why the greatest good is not always desired this i think any one may observe in himself and others that the greater visible good does not always raise mens desires in proportion to the greatness it appears and is acknowledged to have though every little trouble moves us and sets us on work to get rid of it the reason whereof is evident from the nature of our happiness and misery itself all present pain whatever it be makes a part of our present misery but all absent good does not at any time make a necessary part of our present happiness nor the absence of it make a part of our misery if it did we should be constantly and infinitely miserable there being infinite degrees of happiness which are not in our possession all uneasiness therefore being removed a moderate portion of good serves at present to content men and a few degrees of pleasure in a succession of ordinary enjoyments make up a happiness wherein they can be satisfied if this were not so there could be no room for those indifferent and visibly trifling actions to which our wills are so often determined and wherein we voluntarily waste so much of our lives which remissness could by no means consist with a constant determination of will or desire to the greatest apparent good that this is so i think few people need go far from home to be convinced and indeed in this life there are not many whose happiness reaches so far as to afford them a constant train of moderate mean pleasures without any mixture of uneasiness and yet they could be content to stay here for ever though they cannot deny but that it is possible there may be a state of eternal durable joys after this life far surpassing all the good that is to be found here nay they cannot but see that it is more possible than the attainment and continuation of that pittance of honour riches or pleasure which they pursue and for which they neglect that eternal state but yet in full view of this difference satisfied of the possibility of a perfect secure and lasting happiness in a future state and under a clear conviction that it is not to be had herewhilst they bound their happiness within some little enjoyment or aim of this life and exclude the joys of heaven from making any necessary part of ittheir desires are not moved by this greater apparent good nor their wills determined to any action or endeavour for its attainment why not being desired it moves not the will the ordinary necessities of our lives fill a great part of them with the uneasinesses of hunger thirst heat cold weariness with labour and sleepiness in their constant returns c to which if besides accidental harms we add the fantastical uneasiness as itch after honour power or riches c which acquired habits by fashion example and education have settled in us and a thousand other irregular desires which custom has made natural to us we shall find that a very little part of our life is so vacant from these uneasinesses as to leave us free to the attraction of remoter absent good we are seldom at ease and free enough from the solicitation of our natural or adopted desires but a constant succession of uneasinesses out of that stock which natural wants or acquired habits have heaped up take the will in their turns and no sooner is one action dispatched which by such a determination of the will we are set upon but another uneasiness is ready to set us on work for the removing of the pains we feel and are at present pressed with being the getting out of misery and consequently the first thing to be done in order to happinessabsent good though thought on confessed and appearing to be good not making any part of this unhappiness in its absence is justled out to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we feel till due and repeated contemplation has brought it nearer to our mind given some relish of it and raised in us some desire which then beginning to make a part of our present uneasiness stands upon fair terms with the rest to be satisfied and so according to its greatness and pressure comes in its turn to determine the will due consideration raises desire and thus by a due consideration and examining any good proposed it is in our power to raise our desires in a due proportion to the value of that good whereby in its turn and place it may come to work upon the will and be pursued for good though appearing and allowed ever so great yet till it has raised desires in our minds and thereby made us uneasy in its want it reaches not our wills we are not within the sphere of its activity our wills being under the determination only of those uneasinesses which are present to us which whilst we have any are always soliciting and ready at hand to give the will its next determination the balancing when there is any in the mind being only which desire shall be next satisfied which uneasiness first removed whereby it comes to pass that as long as any uneasiness any desire remains in our mind there is no room for good barely as such to come at the will or at all to determine it because as has been said the first step in our endeavours after happiness being to get wholly out of the confines of misery and to feel no part of it the will can be at leisure for nothing else till every uneasiness we feel be perfectly removed which in the multitude of wants and desires we are beset with in this imperfect state we are not like to be ever freed from in this world the power to suspend the prosecution of any desire makes way for consideration there being in us a great many uneasinesses always soliciting and ready to determine the will it is natural as i have said that the greatest and most pressing should determine the will to the next action and so it does for the most part but not always for the mind having in most cases as is evident in experience a power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires and so all one after another is at liberty to consider the objects of them examine them on all sides and weigh them with others in this lies the liberty man has and from the not using of it right comes all that variety of mistakes errors and faults which we run into in the conduct of our lives and our endeavours after happiness whilst we precipitate the determination of our wills and engage too soon before due examination to prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this or that desire as every one daily may experiment in himself this seems to me the source of all liberty in this seems to consist that which is as i think improperly called freewill for during this suspension of any desire before the will be determined to action and the action which follows that determination done we have opportunity to examine view and judge of the good or evil of what we are going to do and when upon due examination we have judged we have done our duty all that we can or ought to do in pursuit of our happiness and it is not a fault but a perfection of our nature to desire will and act according to the last result of a fair examination to be determined by our own judgment is no restraint to liberty this is so far from being a restraint or diminution of freedom that it is the very improvement and benefit of it it is not an abridgment it is the end and use of our liberty and the further we are removed from such a determination the nearer we are to misery and slavery a perfect indifference in the mind not determinable by its last judgment of the good or evil that is thought to attend its choice would be so far from being an advantage and excellency of any intellectual nature that it would be as great an imperfection as the want of indifferency to act or not to act till determined by the will would be an imperfection on the other side a man is at liberty to lift up his hand to his head or let it rest quiet he is perfectly indifferent in either and it would be an imperfection in him if he wanted that power if he were deprived of that indifferency but it would be as great an imperfection if he had the same indifferency whether he would prefer the lifting up his hand or its remaining in rest when it would save his head or eyes from a blow he sees coming it is as much a perfection that desire or the power of preferring should be determined by good as that the power of acting should be determined by the will and the certainer such determination is the greater is the perfection nay were we determined by anything but the last result of our own minds judging of the good or evil of any action we were not free the very end of our freedom being that we may attain the good we choose and therefore every man is put under a necessity by his constitution as an intelligent being to be determined in willing by his own thought and judgment what is best for him to do else he would be under the determination of some other than himself which is want of liberty and to deny that a mans will in every determination follows his own judgment is to say that a man wills and acts for an end that he would not have at the time that he wills and acts for it for if he prefers it in his present thoughts before any other it is plain he then thinks better of it and would have it before any other unless he can have and not have it will and not will it at the same time a contradiction too manifest to be admitted the freest agents are so determined if we look upon those superior beings above us who enjoy perfect happiness we shall have reason to judge that they are more steadily determined in their choice of good than we and yet we have no reason to think they are less happy or less free than we are and if it were fit for such poor finite creatures as we are to pronounce what infinite wisdom and goodness could do i think we might say that god himself cannot choose what is not good the freedom of the almighty hinders not his being determined by what is best a constant determination to a pursuit of happiness no abridgment of liberty but to give a right view of this mistaken part of liberty let me askwould any one be a changeling because he is less determined by wise considerations than a wise man is it worth the name of freedom to be at liberty to play the fool and draw shame and misery upon a mans self if to break loose from the conduct of reason and to want that restraint of examination and judgment which keeps us from choosing or doing the worse be liberty true liberty madmen and fools are the only freemen but yet i think nobody would choose to be mad for the sake of such liberty but he that is mad already the constant desire of happiness and the constraint it puts upon us to act for it nobody i think accounts an abridgment of liberty or at least an abridgment of liberty to be complained of god almighty himself is under the necessity of being happy and the more any intelligent being is so the nearer is its approach to infinite perfection and happiness that in this state of ignorance we shortsighted creatures might not mistake true felicity we are endowed with a power to suspend any particular desire and keep it from determining the will and engaging us in action this is standing still where we are not suffi ciently assured of the way examination is consulting a guide the determination of the will upon inquiry is following the direction of that guide and he that has a power to act or not to act according as such determination directs is a free agent such determination abridges not that power wherein liberty consists he that has his chains knocked off and the prison doors set open to him is perfectly at liberty because he may either go or stay as he best likes though his preference be determined to stay by the darkness of the night or illness of the weather or want of other lodging he ceases not to be free though the desire of some convenience to be had there absolutely determines his preference and makes him stay in his prison the necessity of pursuing true happiness the foundation of liberty as therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness so the care of ourselves that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness is the necessary foundation of our liberty the stronger ties we have to an unalterable pursuit of happiness in general which is our greatest good and which as such our desires always follow the more are we free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action and from a necessary compliance with our desire set upon any particular and then appearing preferable good till we have duly examined whether it has a tendency to or be inconsistent with our real happiness and therefore till we are as much informed upon this inquiry as the weight of the matter and the nature of the case demands we are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desires in particular cases power to suspend this is the hinge on which turns the liberty of intellectual beings in their constant endeavours after and a steady prosecution of true felicitythat they can suspend this prosecution in particular cases till they have looked before them and informed themselves whether that particular thing which is then proposed or desired lie in the way to their main end and make a real part of that which is their greatest good for the inclination and tendency of their nature to happiness is an obligation and motive to them to take care not to mistake or miss it and so necessarily puts them upon caution deliberation and wariness in the direction of their particular actions which are the means to obtain it whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real bliss the same necessity with the same force establishes suspense deliberation and scrutiny of each successive desire whether the satisfaction of it does not interfere with our true happiness and mislead us from it this as seems to me is the great privilege of finite intellectual beings and i desire it may be well considered whether the great inlet and exercise of all the liberty men have are capable of or can be useful to them and that whereon depends the turn of their actions does not lie in thisthat they can suspend their desires and stop them from determining their wills to any action till they have duly and fairly examined the good and evil of it as far forth as the weight of the thing requires this we are able to do and when we have done it we have done our duty and all that is in our power and indeed all that needs for since the will supposes knowledge to guide its choice all that we can do is to hold our wills undetermined till we have examined the good and evil of what we desire what follows after that follows in a chain of consequences linked one to another all depending on the last determination of the judgment which whether it shall be upon a hasty and precipitate view or upon a due and mature examination is in our power experience showing us that in most cases we are able to suspend the present satisfaction of any desire government of our passions the right improvement of liberty but if any extreme disturbance as sometimes it happens possesses our whole mind as when the pain of the rack an impetuous uneasiness as of love anger or any other violent passion running away with us allows us not the liberty of thought and we are not masters enough of our own minds to consider thoroughly and examine fairlygod who knows our frailty pities our weakness and requires of us no more than we are able to do and sees what was and what was not in our power will judge as a kind and merciful father but the forbearance of a too hasty compliance with our desires the moderation and restraint of our passions so that our understandings may be free to examine and reason unbiased give its judgment being that whereon a right direction of our conduct to true happiness depends it is in this we should employ our chief care and endeavours in this we should take pains to suit the relish of our minds to the true intrinsic good or ill that is in things and not permit an allowed or supposed possible great and weighty good to slip out of our thoughts without leaving any relish any desire of itself there till by a due consideration of its true worth we have formed appetites in our minds suitable to it and made ourselves uneasy in the want of it or in the fear of losing it and how much this is in every ones power by making resolutions to himself such as he may keep is easy for every one to try nor let any one say he cannot govern his passions nor hinder them from breaking out and carrying him into action for what he can do before a prince or a great man he can do alone or in the presence of god if he will how men come to pursue different and often evil courses from what has been said it is easy to give an account how it comes to pass that though all men desire happiness yet their wills carry them so contrarily and consequently some of them to what is evil and to this i say that the various and contrary choices that men make in the world do not argue that they do not all pursue good but that the same thing is not good to every man alike this variety of pursuits shows that every one does not place his happiness in the same thing or choose the same way to it were all the concerns of man terminated in this life why one followed study and knowledge and another hawking and hunting why one chose luxury and debauchery and another sobriety and riches would not be because every one of these did not aim at his own happiness but because their happiness was placed in different things and therefore it was a right answer of the physician to his patient that had sore eyesif you have more pleasure in the taste of wine than in the use of your sight wine is good for you but if the pleasure of seeing be greater to you than that of drinking wine is naught all men seek happiness but not of the same sort the mind has a different relish as well as the palate and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all men with riches or glory which yet some men place their happiness in as you would to satisfy all mens hunger with cheese or lobsters which though very agreeable and delicious fare to some are to others extremely nauseous and offensive and many persons would with reason prefer the griping of an hungry belly to those dishes which are a feast to others hence it was i think that the philosophers of old did in vain inquire whether summum bonum consisted in riches or bodily delights or virtue or contemplation and they might have as reasonably disputed whether the best relish were to be found in apples plums or nuts and have divided themselves into sects upon it for as pleasant tastes depend not on the things themselves but on their agreeableness to this or that particular palate wherein there is great variety so the greatest happiness consists in the having those things which produce the greatest pleasure and in the absence of those which cause any disturbance any pain now these to different men are very different things if therefore men in this life only have hope if in this life only they can enjoy it is not strange nor unreasonable that they should seek their happiness by avoiding all things that disease them here and by pursuing all that delight them wherein it will be no wonder to find variety and difference for if there be no prospect beyond the grave the inference is certainly rightlet us eat and drink let us enjoy what we for tomorrow we shall die this i think may serve to show us the reason why though all mens desires tend to happiness yet they are not moved by the same object men may choose different things and yet all choose right supposing them only like a company of poor insects whereof some are bees delighted with flowers and their sweetness others beetles delighted with other kinds of viands which having enjoyed for a season they would cease to be and exist no more for ever power to suspend volition explains responsibility for ill choice these things duly weighed will give us as i think a clear view into the state of human liberty liberty it is plain consists in a power to do or not to do to do or forbear doing as we will this cannot be denied but this seeming to comprehend only the actions of a man consecutive to volition it is further inquiredwhether he be at liberty to will or no and to this it has been answered that in most cases a man is not at liberty to forbear the act of volition he must exert an act of his will whereby the action proposed is made to exist or not to exist but yet there is a case wherein a man is at liberty in respect of willing and that is the choosing of a remote good as an end to be pursued here a man may suspend the act of his choice from being determined for or against the thing proposed till he has examined whether it be really of a nature in itself and consequences to make him happy or not for when he has once chosen it and thereby it is become a part of his happiness it raises desire and that proportionably gives him uneasiness which determines his will and sets him at work in pursuit of his choice on all occasions that offer and here we may see how it comes to pass that a man may justly incur punishment though it be certain that in all the particular actions that he wills he does and necessarily does will that which he then judges to be good for though his will be always determined by that which is judged good by his understanding yet it excuses him not because by a too hasty choice of his own making he has imposed on himself wrong measures of good and evil which however false and fallacious have the same influence on all his future conduct as if they were true and right he has vitiated his own palate and must be answerable to himself for the sickness and death that follows from it the eternal law and nature of things must not be altered to comply with his illordered choice if the neglect or abuse of the liberty he had to examine what would really and truly make for his happiness misleads him the miscarriages that follow on it must be imputed to his own election he had a power to suspend his determination it was given him that he might examine and take care of his own happiness and look that he were not deceived and he could never judge that it was better to be deceived than not in a matter of so great and near concernment why men choose what makes them miserable what has been said may also discover to us the reason why men in this world prefer different things and pursue happiness by contrary courses but yet since men are always constant and in earnest in matters of happiness and misery the question still remains how men come often to prefer the worse to the better and to choose that which by their own confession has made them miserable the causes of this to account for the various and contrary ways men take though all aim at being happy we must consider whence the various uneasinesses that determine the will in the preference of each voluntary action have their rise from bodily pain some of them come from causes not in our power such as are often the pains of the body from want disease or outward injuries as the rack c which when present and violent operate for the most part forcibly on the will and turn the courses of mens lives from virtue piety and religion and what before they judged to lead to happiness every one not endeavouring or through disuse not being able by the contemplation of remote and future good to raise in himself desires of them strong enough to counterbalance the uneasiness he feels in those bodily torments and to keep his will steady in the choice of those actions which lead to future happiness a neighbouring country has been of late a tragical theatre from which we might fetch instances if there needed any and the world did not in all countries and ages furnish examples enough to confirm that received observation necessitas cogit ad turpia and therefore there is great reason for us to pray lead us not into temptation from wrong desires arising from wrong judgments other uneasinesses arise from our desires of absent good which desires always bear proportion to and depend on the judgment we make and the relish we have of any absent good in both which we are apt to be variously misled and that by our own fault our judgment of present good or evil always right in the first place i shall consider the wrong judgments men make of future good and evil whereby their desires are misled for as to present happiness and misery when that alone comes into consideration and the consequences are quite removed a man never chooses amiss he knows what best pleases him and that he actually prefers things in their present enjoyment are what they seem the apparent and real good are in this case always the same for the pain or pleasure being just so great and no greater than it is felt the present good or evil is really so much as it appears and therefore were every action of ours concluded within itself and drew no consequences after it we should undoubtedly never err in our choice of good we should always infallibly prefer the best were the pains of honest industry and of starving with hunger and cold set together before us nobody would be in doubt which to choose were the satisfaction of a lust and the joys of heaven offered at once to any ones present possession he would not balance or err in the determination of his choice our wrong judgments have regard to future good and evil only but since our voluntary actions carry not all the happiness and misery that depend on them along with them in their present performance but are the precedent causes of good and evil which they draw after them and bring upon us when they themselves are past and cease to be our desires look beyond our present enjoyments and carry the mind out to absent good according to the necessity which we think there is of it to the making or increase of our happiness it is our opinion of such a necessity that gives it its attraction without that we are not moved by absent good for in this narrow scantling of capacity which we are accustomed to and sensible of here wherein we enjoy but one pleasure at once which when all uneasiness is away is whilst it lasts sufficient to make us think ourselves happy it is not all remote and even apparent good that affects us because the indolency and enjoyment we have sufficing for our present happiness we desire not to venture the change since we judge that we are happy already being content and that is enough for who is content is happy but as soon as any new uneasiness comes in this happiness is disturbed and we are set afresh on work in the pursuit of happiness from a wrong judgment of what makes a necessary part of their happiness their aptness therefore to conclude that they can be happy without it is one great occasion that men often are not raised to the desire of the greatest absent good for whilst such thoughts possess them the joys of a future state move them not they have little concern or uneasiness about them and the will free from the determination of such desires is left to the pursuit of nearer satisfactions and to the removal of those uneasinesses which it then feels in its want of and longings after them change but a mans view of these things let him see that virtue and religion are necessary to his happiness let him look into the future state of bliss or misery and see there god the righteous judge ready to render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in welldoing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life but unto every soul that doth evil indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish to him i say who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect happiness or misery that attends all men after this life depending on their behaviour here the measures of good and evil that govern his choice are mightily changed for since nothing of pleasure and pain in this life can bear any proportion to the endless happiness or exquisite misery of an immortal soul hereafter actions in his power will have their preference not according to the transient pleasure or pain that accompanies or follows them here but as they serve to secure that perfect durable happiness hereafter a more particular account of wrong judgments but to account more particularly for the misery that men often bring on themselves notwithstanding that they do all in earnest pursue happiness we must consider how things come to be represented to our desires under deceitful appearances and that is by the judgment pronouncing wrongly concerning them to see how far this reaches and what are the causes of wrong judgment we must remember that things are judged good or bad in a double sense first that which is properly good or bad is nothing but barely pleasure or pain secondly but because not only present pleasure and pain but that also which is apt by its efficacy or consequences to bring it upon us at a distance is a proper object of our desires and apt to move a creature that has foresight therefore things also that draw after them pleasure and pain are considered as good and evil no one chooses misery willingly but only by wrong judgment the wrong judgment that misleads us and makes the will often fasten on the worse side lies in misreporting upon the various comparisons of these the wrong judgment i am here speaking of is not what one man may think of the determination of another but what every man himself must confess to be wrong for since i lay it for a certain ground that every intelligent being really seeks happiness which consists in the enjoyment of pleasure without any considerable mixture of uneasiness it is impossible anyone should willingly put into his own draught any bitter ingredient or leave out anything in his power that would tend to his satisfaction and the completing of his happiness but only by a wrong judgment i shall not here speak of that mistake which is the consequence of invincible error which scarce deserves the name of wrong judgment but of that wrong judgment which every man himself must confess to be so men may err in comparing present and future therefore as to present pleasure and pain the mind as has been said never mistakes that which is really good or evil that which is the greater pleasure or the greater pain is really just as it appears but though present pleasure and pain show their difference and degrees so plainly as not to leave room to mistake yet when we compare present pleasure or pain with future which is usually the case in most important determinations of the will we often make wrong judgments of them taking our measures of them in different positions of distance objects near our view are apt to be thought greater than those of a larger size that are more remote and so it is with pleasures and pains the present is apt to carry it and those at a distance have the disadvantage in the comparison thus most men like spendthrift heirs are apt to judge a little in hand better than a great deal to come and so for small matters in possession part with greater ones in reversion but that this is a wrong judgment every one must allow let his pleasure consist in whatever it will since that which is future will certainly come to be present and then having the same advantage of nearness will show itself in its full dimensions and discover his wilful mistake who judged of it by unequal measures were the pleasure of drinking accompanied the very moment a man takes off his glass with that sick stomach and aching head which in some men are sure to follow not many hours after i think nobody whatever pleasure he had in his cups would on these conditions ever let wine touch his lips which yet he daily swallows and the evil side comes to be chosen only by the fallacy of a little difference in time but if pleasure or pain can be so lessened only by a few hours removal how much more will it be so by a further distance to a man that will not by a right judgment do what time will ie bring it home upon himself and consider it as present and there take its true dimensions this is the way we usually impose on ourselves in respect of bare pleasure and pain or the true degrees of happiness or misery the future loses its just proportion and what is present obtains the preference as the greater i mention not here the wrong judgment whereby the absent are not only lessened but reduced to perfect nothing when men enjoy what they can in present and make sure of that concluding amiss that no evil will thence follow for that lies not in comparing the greatness of future good and evil which is that we are here speaking of but in another sort of wrong judgment which is concerning good or evil as it is considered to be the cause and procurement of pleasure or pain that will follow from it causes of our judging amiss when we compare present pleasure and pain with future the cause of our judging amiss when we compare our present pleasure or pain with future seems to me to be the weak and narrow constitution of our minds we cannot well enjoy two pleasures at once much less any pleasure almost whilst pain possesses us the present pleasure if it be not very languid and almost none at all fills our narrow souls and so takes up the whole mind that it scarce leaves any thought of things absent or if among our pleasures there are some which are not strong enough to exclude the consideration of things at a distance yet we have so great an abhorrence of pain that a little of it extinguishes all our pleasures a little bitter mingled in our cup leaves no relish of the sweet hence it comes that at any rate we desire to be rid of the present evil which we are apt to think nothing absent can equal because under the present pain we find not ourselves capable of any the least degree of happiness mens daily complaints are a loud proof of this the pain that any one actually feels is still of all other the worst and it is with anguish they cry outany rather than this nothing can be so intolerable as what i now suffer and therefore our whole endeavours and thoughts are intent to get rid of the present evil before all things as the first necessary condition to our happiness let what will follow nothing as we passionately think can exceed or almost equal the uneasiness that sits so heavy upon us and because the abstinence from a present pleasure that offers itself is a pain nay oftentimes a very great one the desire being inflamed by a near and tempting object it is no wonder that that operates after the same manner pain does and lessens in our thoughts what is future and so forces us as it were blindfold into its embraces absent good unable to counterbalance present uneasiness add to this that absent good or which is the same thing future pleasureespecially if of a sort we are unacquainted withseldom is able to counterbalance any uneasiness either of pain or desire which is present for its greatness being no more than what shall be really tasted when enjoyed men are apt enough to lessen that to make it give place to any present desire and conclude with themselves that when it comes to trial it may possibly not answer the report or opinion that generally passes of it they having often found that not only what others have magnified but even what they themselves have enjoyed with great pleasure and delight at one time has proved insipid or nauseous at another and therefore they see nothing in it for which they should forego a present enjoyment but that this is a false way of judging when applied to the happiness of another life they must confess unless they will say god cannot make those happy he designs to be so for that being intended for a state of happiness it must certainly be agreeable to everyones wish and desire could we suppose their relishes as different there as they are here yet the manna in heaven will suit every ones palate thus much of the wrong judgment we make of present and future pleasure and pain when they are compared together and so the absent considered as future wrong judgment in considering consequences of actions ii as to things good or bad in their consequences and by the aptness that is in them to procure us good or evil in the future we judge amiss several ways when we judge that so much evil does not really depend on them as in truth there does when we judge that though the consequence be of that moment yet it is not of that certainty but that it may otherwise fall out or else by some means be avoided as by industry address change repentance c that these are wrong ways of judging were easy to show in every particular if i would examine them at large singly but i shall only mention this in general viz that it is a very wrong and irrational way of proceeding to venture a greater good for a less upon uncertain guesses and before a due examination be made proportionable to the weightiness of the matter and the concernment it is to us not to mistake this i think every one must confess especially if he considers the usual cause of this wrong judgment whereof these following are some causes of this i ignorance he that judges without informing himself to the utmost that he is capable cannot acquit himself of judging amiss ii inadvertency when a man overlooks even that which he does know this is an affected and present ignorance which misleads our judgments as much as the other judging is as it were balancing an account and determining on which side the odds lie if therefore either side be huddled up in haste and several of the sums that should have gone into the reckoning be overlooked and left out this precipitancy causes as wrong a judgment as if it were a perfect ignorance that which most commonly causes this is the prevalency of some present pleasure or pain heightened by our feeble passionate nature most strongly wrought on by what is present to check this precipitancy our understanding and reason were given us if we will make a right use of them to search and see and then judge thereupon without liberty the understanding would be to no purpose and without understanding liberty if it could be would signify nothing if a man sees what would do him good or harm what would make him happy or miserable without being able to move himself one step towards or from it what is he the better for seeing and he that is at liberty to ramble in perfect darkness what is his liberty better than if he were driven up and down as a bubble by the force of the wind the being acted by a blind impulse from without or from within is little odds the first therefore and great use of liberty is to hinder blind precipitancy the principal exercise of freedom is to stand still open the eyes look about and take a view of the consequence of what we are going to do as much as the weight of the matter requires how much sloth and negligence heat and passion the prevalency of fashion or acquired indispositions do severally contribute on occasion to these wrong judgments i shall not here further inquire i shall only add one other false judgment which i think necessary to mention because perhaps it is little taken notice of though of great influence wrong judgment of what is necessary to our happiness all men desire happiness that is past doubt but as has been already observed when they are rid of pain they are apt to take up with any pleasure at hand or that custom has endeared to them to rest satisfied in that and so being happy till some new desire by making them uneasy disturbs that happiness and shows them that they are not so they look no further nor is the will determined to any action in pursuit of any other known or apparent good for since we find that we cannot enjoy all sorts of good but one excludes another we do not fix our desires on every apparent greater good unless it be judged to be necessary to our happiness if we think we can be happy without it it moves us not this is another occasion to men of judging wrong when they take not that to be necessary to their happiness which really is so this mistake misleads us both in the choice of the good we aim at and very often in the means to it when it is a remote good but which way ever it be either by placing it where really it is not or by neglecting the means as not necessary to itwhen a man misses his great end happiness he will acknowledge he judged not right that which contributes to this mistake is the real or supposed unpleasantness of the actions which are the way to this end it seeming so preposterous a thing to men to make themselves unhappy in order to happiness that they do not easily bring themselves to it we can change the agreeableness or disagreeableness in things the last inquiry therefore concerning this matter iswhether it be in a mans power to change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that accompanies any sort of action and as to that it is plain in many cases he can men may and should correct their palates and give relish to what either has or they suppose has none the relish of the mind is as various as that of the body and like that too may be altered and it is a mistake to think that men cannot change the displeasingness or indifferency that is in actions into pleasure and desire if they will do but what is in their power a due consideration will do it in some cases and practice application and custom in most bread or tobacco may be neglected where they are shown to be useful to health because of an indifferency or disrelish to them reason and consideration at first recommends and begins their trial and use finds or custom makes them pleasant that this is so in virtue too is very certain actions are pleasing or displeasing either in themselves or considered as a means to a greater and more desirable end the eating of a wellseasoned dish suited to a mans palate may move the mind by the delight itself that accompa nies the eating without reference to any other end to which the consideration of the pleasure there is in health and strength to which that meat is subservient may add a new gusto able to make us swallow an illrelished potion in the latter of these any action is rendered more or less pleasing only by the contemplation of the end and the being more or less persuaded of its tendency to it or necessary connexion with it but the pleasure of the action itself is best acquired or increased by use and practice trials often reconcile us to that which at a distance we looked on with aversion and by repetitions wear us into a liking of what possibly in the first essay displeased us habits have powerful charms and put so strong attractions of easiness and pleasure into what we accustom ourselves to that we cannot forbear to do or at least be easy in the omission of actions which habitual practice has suited and thereby recommends to us though this be very visible and every ones experience shows him he can do so yet it is a part in the conduct of men towards their happiness neglected to a degree that it will be possibly entertained as a paradox if it be said that men can make things or actions more or less pleasing to themselves and thereby remedy that to which one may justly impute a great deal of their wandering fashion and the common opinion having settled wrong notions and education and custom ill habits the just values of things are misplaced and the palates of men corrupted pains should be taken to rectify these and contrary habits change our pleasures and give a relish to that which is necessary or conducive to our happiness this every one must confess he can do and when happiness is lost and misery overtakes him he will confess he did amiss in neglecting it and condemn himself for it and i ask every one whether he has not often done so preference of vice to virtue a manifest wrong judgment i shall not now enlarge any further on the wrong judgments and neglect of what is in their power whereby men mislead themselves this would make a volume and is not my business but whatever false notions or shameful neglect of what is in their power may put men out of their way to happiness and distract them as we see into so different courses of life this yet is certain that morality established upon its true foundations cannot but determine the choice in any one that will but consider and he that will not be so far a rational creature as to reflect seriously upon infinite happiness and misery must needs condemn himself as not making that use of his understanding he should the rewards and punishments of another life which the almighty has established as the enforcements of his law are of weight enough to determine the choice against whatever pleasure or pain this life can show when the eternal state is considered but in its bare possibility which nobody can make any doubt of he that will allow exquisite and endless happiness to be but the possible consequence of a good life here and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one must own himself to judge very much amiss if he does not concludethat a virtuous life with the certain expectation of everlasting bliss which may come is to be preferred to a vicious one with the fear of that dreadful state of misery which it is very possible may overtake the guilty or at best the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation this is evidently so though the virtuous life here had nothing but pain and the vicious continual pleasure which yet is for the most part quite otherwise and wicked men have not much the odds to brag of even in their present possession nay all things rightly considered have i think even the worse part here but when infinite happiness is put into one scale against infinite misery in the other if the worst that comes to the pious man if he mistakes be the best that the wicked can attain to if he be in the right who can without madness run the venture who in his wits would choose to come within a possibility of infinite misery which if he miss there is yet nothing to be got by that hazard whereas on the other side the sober man ventures nothing against infinite happiness to be got if his expectation comes not to pass if the good man be in the right he is eternally happy if he mistakes hes not miserable he feels nothing on the other side if the wicked man be in the right he is not happy if he mistakes he is infinitely miserable must it not be a most manifest wrong judg ment that does not presently see to which side in this case the preference is to be given i have forborne to mention anything of the certainty or probability of a future state designing here to show the wrong judgment that any one must allow he makes upon his own principles laid how he pleases who prefers the short pleasures of a vicious life upon any consideration whilst he knows and cannot but be certain that a future life is at least possible recapitulationliberty of indifferency to conclude this inquiry into human liberty which as it stood before i myself from the beginning fearing and a very judicious friend of mine since the publication suspecting to have some mistake in it though he could not particularly show it me i was put upon a stricter review of this chapter wherein lighting upon a very easy and scarce observable slip i had made in putting one seemingly indifferent word for another that discovery opened to me this present view which here in this second edition i submit to the learned world and which in short is this liberty is a power to act or not to act according as the mind directs a power to direct the operative faculties to motion or rest in particular instances is that which we call the will that which in the train of our voluntary actions determines the will to any change of operation is some present uneasiness which is or at least is always accompanied with that of desire desire is always moved by evil to fly it because a total freedom from pain always makes a necessary part of our happiness but every good nay every greater good does not constantly move desire because it may not make or may not be taken to make part of our happiness for all that we desire is only to be happy but though this general desire of happiness operates constantly and invariably yet the satisfaction of any particular desire can be suspended from determining the will to any subservient action till we have maturely examined whether the particular apparent good which we then desire makes a part of our real happiness or be consistent or inconsistent with it the result of our judgment upon that examination is what ultimately determines the man who could not be free if his will were determined by any thing but his own desire guided by his own judgment i know that liberty by some is placed in an indifferency of the man antecedent to the determination of his will i wish they who lay so much stress on such an antecedent indifferency as they call it had told us plainly whether this supposed indifferency be antecedent to the thought and judgment of the understanding as well as to the decree of the will for it is pretty hard to state it between them ie immediately after the judgment of the understanding and before the determination of the will because the determination of the will immediately follows the judgment of the understanding and to place liberty in an indifferency antecedent to the thought and judgment of the understanding seems to me to place liberty in a state of darkness wherein we can neither see nor say anything of it at least it places it in a subject incapable of it no agent being allowed capable of liberty but in consequence of thought and judgment i am not nice about phrases and therefore consent to say with those that love to speak so that liberty is placed in indifferency but it is an indifferency which remains after the judgment of the understanding yea even after the determination of the will and that is an indifferency not of the man for after he has once judged which is best viz to do or forbear he is no longer indifferent but an indifferency of the operative powers of the man which remaining equally able to operate or to forbear operating after as before the decree of the will are in a state which if one pleases may be called indifferency and as far as this indifferency reaches a man is free and no further vg i have the ability to move my hand or to let it rest that operative power is indifferent to move or not to move my hand i am then in that respect perfectly free my will determines that operative power to rest i am yet free because the indifferency of that my operative power to act or not to act still remains the power of moving my hand is not at all impaired by the determination of my will which at present orders rest the indifferency of that power to act or not to act is just as it was before as will appear if the will puts it to the trial by ordering the contrary but if during the rest of my hand it be seized with a sudden palsy the indifferency of that operative power is gone and with it my liberty i have no longer freedom in that respect but am under a necessity of letting my hand rest on the other side if my hand be put into motion by a convulsion the indifferency of that operative faculty is taken away by that motion and my liberty in that case is lost for i am under a necessity of having my hand move i have added this to show in what sort of indifferency liberty seems to me to consist and not in any other real or imaginary active and passive power in motions and in thinking true notions concerning the nature and extent of liberty are of so great importance that i hope i shall be pardoned this digression which my attempt to explain it has led me into the ideas of will volition liberty and necessity in this chapter of power came naturally in my way in a former edition of this treatise i gave an account of my thoughts concerning them according to the light i then had and now as a lover of truth and not a worshipper of my own doctrines i own some change of my opinion which i think i have discovered ground for in what i first writ i with an unbiased indifferency followed truth whither i thought she led me but neither being so vain as to fancy infallibility nor so disingenuous as to dissemble my mistakes for fear of blemishing my reputation i have with the same sincere design for truth only not been ashamed to publish what a severer inquiry has suggested it is not impossible but that some may think my former notions right and some as i have already found these latter and some neither i shall not at all wonder at this variety in mens opinions impartial deductions of reason in controverted points being so rare and exact ones in abstract notions not so very easy especially if of any length and therefore i should think myself not a little beholden to any one who would upon these or any other grounds fairly clear this subject of liberty from any difficulties that may yet remain before i close this chapter it may perhaps be to our purpose and help to give us clearer conceptions about power if we make our thoughts take a little more exact survey of action i have said above that we have ideas but of two sorts of action viz motion and thinking these in truth though called and counted actions yet if nearly considered will not be found to be always perfectly so for if i mistake not there are instances of both kinds which upon due consideration will be found rather passions than actions and consequently so far the effects barely of passive powers in those subjects which yet on their accounts are thought agents for in these instances the substance that hath motion or thought receives the impression whereby it is put into that action purely from without and so acts merely by the capacity it has to receive such an impression from some external agent and such power is not properly an active power but a mere passive capacity in the subject sometimes the substance or agent puts itself into action by its own power and this is properly active power whatsoever modification a substance has whereby it produces any effect that is called action vg a solid substance by motion operates on or alters the sensible ideas of another substance and therefore this modification of motion we call action but yet this motion in that solid substance is when rightly considered but a passion if it received it only from some external agent so that the active power of motion is in no substance which cannot begin motion in itself or in another substance when at rest so likewise in thinking a power to receive ideas or thoughts from the operation of any external substance is called a power of thinking but this is but a passive power or capacity but to be able to bring into view ideas out of sight at ones own choice and to compare which of them one thinks fit this is an active power this reflection may be of some use to preserve us from mistakes about powers and actions which grammar and the common frame of languages may be apt to lead us into since what is signified by verbs that grammarians call active does not always signify action vg this proposition i see the moon or a star or i feel the heat of the sun though expressed by a verb active does not signify any action in me whereby i operate on those substances but only the reception of the ideas of light roundness and heat wherein i am not active but barely passive and cannot in that position of my eyes or body avoid receiving them but when i turn my eyes another way or remove my body out of the sunbeams i am properly active because of my own choice by a power within myself i put myself into that motion such an action is the product of active power summary of our original ideas and thus i have in a short draught given a view of our original ideas from whence all the rest are derived and of which they are made up which if i would consider as a philosopher and examine on what causes they depend and of what they are made i believe they all might be reduced to these very few primary and original ones viz extension solidity mobility or the power of being moved which by our senses we receive from body perceptivity or the power of perception or thinking motivity or the power of moving which by reflection we receive from our minds i crave leave to make use of these two new words to avoid the danger of being mistaken in the use of those which are equivocal to which if we add existence duration number which belong both to the one and the other we have perhaps all the original ideas on which the rest depend for by these i imagine might be explained the nature of colours sounds tastes smells and all other ideas we have if we had but faculties acute enough to perceive the severally modified extensions and motions of these minute bodies which produce those several sensations in us but my present purpose being only to inquire into the knowledge the mind has of things by those ideas and appearances which god has fitted it to receive from them and how the mind comes by that knowledge rather than into their causes or manner of production i shall not contrary to the design of this essay set myself to inquire philosophically into the peculiar constitution of bodies and the configuration of parts whereby they have the power to produce in us the ideas of their sensible qualities i shall not enter any further into that disquisition it sufficing to my purpose to observe that gold or saffron has a power to produce in us the idea of yellow and snow or milk the idea of white which we can only have by our sight without examining the texture of the parts of those bodies or the particular figures or motion of the particles which rebound from them to cause in us that particular sensation though when we go beyond the bare ideas in our minds and would inquire into their causes we cannot conceive anything else to be in any sensible object whereby it produces different ideas in us but the different bulk figure number texture and motion of its insensible parts of mixed modes mixed modes what having treated of simple modes in the foregoing chapters and given several instances of some of the most considerable of them to show what they are and how we come by them we are now in the next place to consider those we call mixed modes such are the complex ideas we mark by the names obligation drunkenness a lie c which consisting of several combinations of simple ideas of different kinds i have called mixed modes to distinguish them from the more simple modes which consist only of simple ideas of the same kind these mixed modes being also such combinations of simple ideas as are not looked upon to be characteristical marks of any real beings that have a steady existence but scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind are thereby distinguished from the complex ideas of substances made by the mind that the mind in respect of its simple ideas is wholly passive and receives them all from the existence and operations of things such as sensation or reflection offers them without being able to make any one idea experience shows us but if we attentively consider these ideas i call mixed modes we are now speaking of we shall find their original quite different the mind often exercises an active power in making these several combinations for it being once furnished with simple ideas it can put them together in several compositions and so make variety of complex ideas without examining whether they exist so together in nature and hence i think it is that these ideas are called notions as if they had their original and constant existence more in the thoughts of men than in the reality of things and to form such ideas it sufficed that the mind put the parts of them together and that they were consistent in the understanding without considering whether they had any real being though i do not deny but several of them might be taken from observation and the existence of several simple ideas so combined as they are put together in the understanding for the man who first framed the idea of hypocrisy might have either taken it at first from the observation of one who made show of good qualities which he had not or else have framed that idea in his mind without having any such pattern to fashion it by for it is evident that in the beginning of languages and societies of men several of those complex ideas which were consequent to the constitutions established amongst them must needs have been in the minds of men before they existed anywhere else and that many names that stood for such complex ideas were in use and so those ideas framed before the combinations they stood for ever existed sometimes got by the explication of their names indeed now that languages are made and abound with words standing for such combinations an usual way of getting these complex ideas is by the explication of those terms that stand for them for consisting of a company of simple ideas combined they may by words standing for those simple ideas be represented to the mind of one who understands those words though that complex combination of simple ideas were never offered to his mind by the real existence of things thus a man may come to have the idea of sacrilege or murder by enumerating to him the simple ideas which these words stand for without ever seeing either of them committed the name ties the parts of mixed modes into one idea every mixed mode consisting of many distinct simple ideas it seems reasonable to inquire whence it has its unity and how such a precise multitude comes to make but one idea since that combination does not always exist together in nature to which i answer it is plain it has its unity from an act of the mind combining those several simple ideas together and considering them as one complex one consisting of those parts and the mark of this union or that which is looked on generally to complete it is one name given to that combination for it is by their names that men commonly regulate their account of their distinct species of mixed modes seldom allowing or considering any number of simple ideas to make one complex one but such collections as there be names for thus though the killing of an old man be as fit in nature to be united into one complex idea as the killing a mans father yet there being no name standing precisely for the one as there is the name of parricide to mark the other it is not taken for a particular complex idea nor a distinct species of actions from that of killing a young man or any other man the cause of making mixed modes if we should inquire a little further to see what it is that occasions men to make several combinations of simple ideas into distinct and as it were settled modes and neglect others which in the nature of things themselves have as much an aptness to be combined and make distinct ideas we shall find the reason of it to be the end of language which being to mark or communicate mens thoughts to one another with all the dispatch that may be they usually make such collections of ideas into complex modes and affix names to them as they have frequent use of in their way of living and conversation leaving others which they have but seldom an occasion to mention loose and without names that tie them together they rather choosing to enumerate when they have need such ideas as make them up by the particular names that stand for them than to trouble their memories by multiplying of complex ideas with names to them which they seldom or never have any occasion to make use of why words in one language have none answering in another this shows us how it comes to pass that there are in every language many particular words which can not be rendered by any one single word of another for the several fashions customs and manners of one nation making several combinations of ideas familiar and necessary in one which another people have had never an occasion to make or perhaps so much as take notice of names come of course to be annexed to them to avoid long periphrases in things of daily conversation and so they become so many distinct complex ideas in their minds thus ostrhakismos amongst the greeks and proscriptio amongst the romans were words which other languages had no names that exactly answered because they stood for complex ideas which were not in the minds of the men of other nations where there was no such custom there was no notion of any such actions no use of such combinations of ideas as were united and as it were tied together by those terms and therefore in other countries there were no names for them and languages change hence also we may see the reason why languages constantly change take up new and lay by old terms because change of customs and opinions bringing with it new combinations of ideas which it is necessary frequently to think on and talk about new names to avoid long descriptions are annexed to them and so they become new species of complex modes what a number of different ideas are by this means wrapped up in one short sound and how much of our time and breath is thereby saved any one will see who will but take the pains to enumerate all the ideas that either reprieve or appeal stand for and instead of either of those names use a periphrasis to make any one understand their meaning mixed modes where they exist though i shall have occasion to consider this more at large when i come to treat of words and their use yet i could not avoid to take this much notice here of the names of mixed modes which being fleeting and transient combinations of simple ideas which have but a short existence anywhere but in the minds of men and there too have no longer any existence than whilst they are thought on have not so much anywhere the appearance of a constant and lasting existence as in their names which are therefore in this sort of ideas very apt to be taken for the ideas themselves for if we should inquire where the idea of a triumph or apotheosis exists it is evident they could neither of them exist altogether anywhere in the things themselves being actions that required time to their performance and so could never all exist together and as to the minds of men where the ideas of these actions are supposed to be lodged they have there too a very uncertain existence and therefore we are apt to annex them to the names that excite them in us how we get the ideas of mixed modes there are therefore three ways whereby we get these complex ideas of mixed modes by experience and observation of things themselves thus by seeing two men wrestle or fence we get the idea of wrestling or fencing by invention or voluntary putting together of several simple ideas in our own minds so he that first invented printing or etching had an idea of it in his mind before it ever existed which is the most usual way by explaining the names of actions we never saw or motions we cannot see and by enumerating and thereby as it were setting before our imaginations all those ideas which go to the making them up and are the constituent parts of them for having by sensation and reflection stored our minds with simple ideas and by use got the names that stand for them we can by those means represent to another any complex idea we would have him conceive so that it has in it no simple ideas but what he knows and has with us the same name for for all our complex ideas are ultimately resolvable into simple ideas of which they are compounded and originally made up though perhaps their immediate ingredients as i may so say are also complex ideas thus the mixed mode which the word lie stands for is made of these simple ideas articulate sounds certain ideas in the mind of the speaker those words the signs of those ideas those signs put together by affirmation or negation otherwise than the ideas they stand for are in the mind of the speaker i think i need not go any further in the analysis of that complex idea we call a lie what i have said is enough to show that it is made up of simple ideas and it could not be but an offensive tediousness to my reader to trouble him with a more minute enumeration of every particular simple idea that goes to this complex one which from what has been said he cannot but be able to make out to himself the same may be done in all our complex ideas whatsoever which however compounded and decompounded may at last be resolved into simple ideas which are all the materials of knowledge or thought we have or can have nor shall we have reason to fear that the mind is hereby stinted to too scanty a number of ideas if we consider what an inexhaustible stock of simple modes number and figure alone afford us how far then mixed modes which admit of the various combinations of different simple ideas and their infinite modes are from being few and scanty we may easily imagine so that before we have done we shall see that nobody need be afraid he shall not have scope and compass enough for his thoughts to range in though they be as i pretend confined only to simple ideas received from sensation or reflection and their several combinations motion thinking and power have been most modified it is worth our observing which of all our simple ideas have been most modified and had most mixed ideas made out of them with names given to them and those have been these threethinking and motion which are the two ideas which comprehend in them all action and power from whence these actions are conceived to flow these simple ideas i say of thinking motion and power have been those which have been most modified and out of whose modifications have been made most complex modes with names to them for action being the great business of mankind and the whole matter about which all laws are conversant it is no wonder that the several modes of thinking and motion should be taken notice of the ideas of them observed and laid up in the memory and have names assigned to them without which laws could be but ill made or vice and disorders repressed nor could any communication be well had amongst men without such complex ideas with names to them and therefore men have settled names and supposed settled ideas in their minds of modes of actions distinguished by their causes means objects ends instruments time place and other circumstances and also of their powers fitted for those actions vg boldness is the power to speak or do what we intend before others without fear or disorder and the greeks call the confidence of speaking by a peculiar name parrhesia which power or ability in man of doing anything when it has been acquired by frequent doing the same thing is that idea we name habit when it is forward and ready upon every occasion to break into action we call it disposition thus testiness is a disposition or aptness to be angry to conclude let us examine any modes of action vg consideration and assent which are actions of the mind running and speaking which are actions of the body revenge and murder which are actions of both together and we shall find them but so many collections of simple ideas which together make up the complex ones signified by those names several words seeming to signify action signify but the effect power being the source from whence all action proceeds the substances wherein these powers are when they exert this power into act are called causes and the substances which thereupon are produced or the simple ideas which are introduced into any subject by the exerting of that power are called effects the efficacy whereby the new substance or idea is produced is called in the subject exerting that power action but in the subject wherein any simple idea is changed or produced it is called passion which efficacy however various and the effects almost infinite yet we can i think conceive it in intellectual agents to be nothing else but modes of thinking and willing in corporeal agents nothing else but modifications of motion i say i think we cannot conceive it to be any other but these two for whatever sort of action besides these produce any effects i confess myself to have no notion nor idea of and so it is quite remote from my thoughts apprehensions and knowledge and as much in the dark to me as five other senses or as the ideas of colours to a blind man and therefore many words which seem to express some action signify nothing of the action or modus operandi at all but barely the effect with some circumstances of the subject wrought on or cause op erating vg creation annihilation contain in them no idea of the action or manner whereby they are produced but barely of the cause and the thing done and when a countryman says the cold freezes water though the word freezing seems to import some action yet truly it signifies nothing but the effect viz that water that was before fluid is become hard and consistent without containing any idea of the action whereby it is done mixed modes made also of other ideas than those of power and action i think i shall not need to remark here that though power and action make the greatest part of mixed modes marked by names and familiar in the minds and mouths of men yet other simple ideas and their several combinations are not excluded much less i think will it be necessary for me to enumerate all the mixed modes which have been settled with names to them that would be to make a dictionary of the greatest part of the words made use of in divinity ethics law and politics and several other sciences all that is requisite to my present design is to show what sort of ideas those are which i call mixed modes how the mind comes by them and that they are compositions made up of simple ideas got from sensation and reflection which i suppose i have done of our complex ideas of substances ideas of particular substances how made the mind being as i have declared furnished with a great number of the simple ideas conveyed in by the senses as they are found in exterior things or by reflection on its own operations takes notice also that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together which being presumed to belong to one thing and words being suited to common apprehensions and made use of for quick dispatch are called so united in one subject by one name which by inadvertency we are apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea which indeed is a complication of many ideas together because as i have said not imagining how these simple ideas can subsist by themselves we accustom ourselves to sup pose some substratum wherein they do subsist and from which they do result which therefore we call substance our obscure idea of substance in general so that if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general he will find he has no other idea of it at all but only a supposition of he knows not what support of such qualities which are capable of producing simple ideas in us which qualities are commonly called accidents if any one should be asked what is the subject wherein colour or weight inheres he would have nothing to say but the solid extended parts and if he were demanded what is it that solidity and extension adhere in he would not be in a much better case than the indian before mentioned who saying that the world was supported by a great elephant was asked what the elephant rested on to which his answer wasa great tortoise but being again pressed to know what gave support to the broadbacked tortoise repliedsomething he knew not what and thus here as in all other cases where we use words without having clear and distinct ideas we talk like children who being questioned what such a thing is which they know not readily give this satisfactory answer that it is something which in truth signifies no more when so used either by children or men but that they know not what and that the thing they pretend to know and talk of is what they have no distinct idea of at all and so are perfectly ignorant of it and in the dark the idea then we have to which we give the general name substance being nothing but the supposed but unknown support of those qualities we find existing which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante without something to support them we call that support substantia which according to the true import of the word is in plain english standing under or upholding of the sorts of substances an obscure and relative idea of substance in general being thus made we come to have the ideas of particular sorts of substances by collecting such combinations of simple ideas as are by experience and observation of mens senses taken notice of to exist together and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution or un known essence of that substance thus we come to have the ideas of a man horse gold water c of which substances whether any one has any other clear idea further than of certain simple ideas coexistent together i appeal to every ones own experience it is the ordinary qualities observable in iron or a diamond put together that make the true complex idea of those substances which a smith or a jeweller commonly knows better than a philosopher who whatever substantial forms he may talk of has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are to be found in them only we must take notice that our complex ideas of substances besides all those simple ideas they are made up of have always the confused idea of something to which they belong and in which they subsist and therefore when we speak of any sort of substance we say it is a thing having such or such qualities as body is a thing that is extended figured and capable of motion spirit a thing capable of thinking and so hardness friability and power to draw iron we say are qualities to be found in a loadstone these and the like fashions of speaking intimate that the substance is supposed always something besides the extension figure solidity motion thinking or other observable ideas though we know not what it is no clear or distinct idea of substance in general hence when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substances as horse stone c though the idea we have of either of them be but the complication or collection of those several simple ideas of sensible qualities which we used to find united in the thing called horse or stone yet because we cannot conceive how they should subsist alone nor one in another we suppose them existing in and supported by some common subject which support we denote by the name substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support as clear an idea of spiritual substance as of corporeal substance the same thing happens concerning the operations of the mind viz thinking reasoning fearing c which we concluding not to subsist of themselves nor apprehending how they can belong to body or be produced by it we are apt to think these the actions of some other substance which we call spirit whereby yet it is evident that having no other idea or notion of matter but something wherein those many sensible qualities which affect our senses do subsist by supposing a substance wherein thinking knowing doubting and a power of moving c do subsist we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body the one being supposed to be without knowing what it is the substratum to those simple ideas we have from without and the other supposed with a like ignorance of what it is to be the substratum to those operations we experiment in ourselves within it is plain then that the idea of corporeal substance in matter is as remote from our conceptions and apprehensions as that of spiritual substance or spirit and therefore from our not having any notion of the substance of spirit we can no more conclude its nonexistence than we can for the same reason deny the existence of body it being as rational to affirm there is no body because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter as to say there is no spirit because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of a spirit our ideas of particular sorts of substances whatever therefore be the secret abstract nature of substance in general all the ideas we have of particular distinct sorts of substances are nothing but several combinations of simple ideas coexisting in such though unknown cause of their union as makes the whole subsist of itself it is by such combinations of simple ideas and nothing else that we represent particular sorts of substances to ourselves such are the ideas we have of their several species in our minds and such only do we by their specific names signify to others vg man horse sun water iron upon hearing which words every one who understands the language frames in his mind a combination of those several simple ideas which he has usually observed or fancied to exist together under that denomination all which he supposes to rest in and be as it were adherent to that unknown common subject which inheres not in anything else though in the meantime it be manifest and every one upon inquiry into his own thoughts will find that he has no other idea of any substance vg let it be gold horse iron man vitriol bread but what he has barely of those sensible qualities which he supposes to inhere with a supposition of such a substratum as gives as it were a support to those qualities or simple ideas which he has observed to exist united together thus the idea of the sun what is it but an aggregate of those several simple ideas bright hot roundish having a constant regular motion at a certain distance from us and perhaps some other as he who thinks and discourses of the sun has been more or less accurate in observing those sensible qualities ideas or properties which are in that thing which he calls the sun their active and passive powers a great part of our complex ideas of substances for he has the perfectest idea of any of the particular sorts of substances who has gathered and put together most of those simple ideas which do exist in it among which are to be reckoned its active powers and passive capacities which though not simple ideas yet in this respect for brevitys sake may conveniently enough be reckoned amongst them thus the power of drawing iron is one of the ideas of the complex one of that substance we call a loadstone and a power to be so drawn is a part of the complex one we call iron which powers pass for inherent qualities in those subjects because every substance being as apt by the powers we observe in it to change some sensible qualities in other subjects as it is to produce in us those simple ideas which we receive immediately from it does by those new sensible qualities introduced into other subjects discover to us those powers which do thereby mediately affect our senses as regularly as its sensible qualities do it immediately vg we immediately by our senses perceive in fire its heat and colour which are if rightly considered nothing but powers in it to produce those ideas in us we also by our senses perceive the colour and brittleness of charcoal whereby we come by the knowledge of another power in fire which it has to change the colour and consistency of wood by the former fire immediately by the latter it mediately discovers to us these several powers which therefore we look upon to be a part of the qualities of fire and so make them a part of the complex idea of it for all those powers that we take cognizance of terminating only in the alteration of some sensible qualities in those subjects on which they operate and so making them exhibit to us new sensible ideas therefore it is that i have reckoned these powers amongst the simple ideas which make the complex ones of the sort of substances though these powers considered in themselves are truly complex ideas and in this looser sense i crave leave to be understood when i name any of these potentialities among the simple ideas which we recollect in our minds when we think of particular substances for the powers that are severally in them are necessary to be considered if we will have true distinct notions of the several sorts of substances and why nor are we to wonder that powers make a great part of our complex ideas of substances since their secondary qualities are those which in most of them serve principally to distinguish substances one from another and commonly make a considerable part of the complex idea of the several sorts of them for our senses failing us in the discovery of the bulk texture and figure of the minute parts of bodies on which their real constitutions and differences depend we are fain to make use of their secondary qualities as the characteristical notes and marks whereby to frame ideas of them in our minds and distinguish them one from another all which secondary qualities as has been shown are nothing but bare powers for the colour and taste of opium are as well as its soporific or anodyne virtues mere powers depending on its primary qualities whereby it is fitted to produce different operations on different parts of our bodies three sorts of ideas make our complex ones of corporeal substances the ideas that make our complex ones of corporeal substances are of these three sorts first the ideas of the primary qualities of things which are discovered by our senses and are in them even when we perceive them not such are the bulk figure number situation and motion of the parts of bodies which are really in them whether we take notice of them or not secondly the sensible secondary qualities which depending on these are nothing but the powers those substances have to produce several ideas in us by our senses which ideas are not in the things themselves otherwise than as anything is in its cause thirdly the aptness we consider in any substance to give or receive such alterations of primary qualities as that the substance so altered should produce in us different ideas from what it did before these are called active and passive powers all which powers as far as we have any notice or notion of them terminate only in sensible simple ideas for whatever alteration a loadstone has the power to make in the minute particles of iron we should have no notion of any power it had at all to operate on iron did not its sensible motion discover it and i doubt not but there are a thousand changes that bodies we daily handle have a power to use in one another which we never suspect because they never appear in sensible effects powers thus make a great part of our complex ideas of particular substances powers therefore justly make a great part of our complex ideas of substances he that will examine his complex idea of gold will find several of its ideas that make it up to be only powers as the power of being melted but of not spending itself in the fire of being dissolved in aqua regia are ideas as necessary to make up our complex idea of gold as its colour and weight which if duly considered are also nothing but different powers for to speak truly yellowness is not actually in gold but is a power in gold to produce that idea in us by our eyes when placed in a due light and the heat which we cannot leave out of our ideas of the sun is no more really in the sun than the white colour it introduces into wax these are both equally powers in the sun operating by the motion and figure of its sensible parts so on a man as to make him have the idea of heat and so on wax as to make it capable to produce in a man the idea of white the now secondary qualities of bodies would disappear if we could discover the primary ones of their minute parts had we senses acute enough to discern the minute particles of bodies and the real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend i doubt not but they would produce quite different ideas in us and that which is now the yellow colour of gold would then disappear and instead of it we should see an admirable texture of parts of a certain size and figure this microscopes plainly discover to us for what to our naked eyes produces a certain colour is by thus augmenting the acuteness of our senses discovered to be quite a different thing and the thus altering as it were the proportion of the bulk of the minute parts of a coloured object to our usual sight produces different ideas from what it did before thus sand or pounded glass which is opaque and white to the naked eye is pellucid in a microscope and a hair seen in this way loses its former colour and is in a great measure pellucid with a mixture of some bright sparkling colours such as appear from the refraction of diamonds and other pellucid bodies blood to the naked eye appears all red but by a good microscope wherein its lesser parts appear shows only some few globules of red swimming in a pellucid liquor and how these red globules would appear if glasses could be found that could yet magnify them a thousand or ten thousand times more is uncertain our faculties for discovery of the qualities and powers of substances suited to our state the infinite wise contriver of us and all things about us hath fitted our senses faculties and organs to the conveniences of life and the business we have to do here we are able by our senses to know and distinguish things and to examine them so far as to apply them to our uses and several ways to accommodate the exigences of this life we have insight enough into their admirable contrivances and wonderful effects to admire and magnify the wisdom power and goodness of their author such a knowledge as this which is suited to our present condition we want not faculties to attain but it appears not that god intended we should have a perfect clear and adequate knowledge of them that perhaps is not in the comprehension of any finite being we are furnished with faculties dull and weak as they are to discover enough in the creatures to lead us to the knowledge of the creator and the knowledge of our duty and we are fitted well enough with abilities to provide for the conveniences of living these are our business in this world but were our senses altered and made much quicker and acuter the appearance and outward scheme of things would have quite another face to us and i am apt to think would be inconsistent with our being or at least wellbeing in this part of the universe which we inhabit he that considers how little our constitution is able to bear a remove into parts of this air not much higher than that we commonly breath in will have reason to be satisfied that in this globe of earth allotted for our mansion the allwise architect has suited our organs and the bodies that are to affect them one to another if our sense of hearing were but a thousand times quicker than it is how would a perpetual noise distract us and we should in the quietest retirement be less able to sleep or meditate than in the middle of a seafight nay if that most instructive of our senses seeing were in any man a thousand or a hundred thousand times more acute than it is by the best microscope things several millions of times less than the smallest object of his sight now would then be visible to his naked eyes and so he would come nearer to the discovery of the texture and motion of the minute parts of corporeal things and in many of them probably get ideas of their internal constitutions but then he would be in a quite different world from other people nothing would appear the same to him and others the visible ideas of everything would be different so that i doubt whether he and the rest of men could discourse concerning the objects of sight or have any communication about colours their appearances being so wholly different and perhaps such a quickness and tenderness of sight could not endure bright sunshine or so much as open daylight nor take in but a very small part of any object at once and that too only at a very near distance and if by the help of such microscopical eyes if i may so call them a man could penetrate further than ordinary into the secret composition and radical texture of bodies he would not make any great advantage by the change if such an acute sight would not serve to conduct him to the market and exchange if he could not see things he was to avoid at a convenient distance nor distinguish things he had to do with by those sensible qualities others do he that was sharpsighted enough to see the configuration of the minute particles of the spring of a clock and observe upon what peculiar structure and impulse its elastic motion depends would no doubt discover something very admirable but if eyes so framed could not view at once the hand and the characters of the hourplate and thereby at a distance see what oclock it was their owner could not be much benefited by that acuteness which whilst it discovered the secret contrivance of the parts of the machine made him lose its use conjecture about the corporeal organs of some spirits and here give me leave to propose an extravagant conjecture of mine viz that since we have some reason if there be any credit to be given to the report of things that our philosophy cannot account for to imagine that spirits can assume to themselves bodies of different bulk figure and conformation of partswhether one great advantage some of them have over us may not lie in this that they can so frame and shape to themselves organs of sensation or perception as to suit them to their present design and the circumstances of the object they would consider for how much would that man exceed all others in knowledge who had but the faculty so to alter the structure of his eyes that one sense as to make it capable of all the several degrees of vision which the assistance of glasses casually at first lighted on has taught us to conceive what wonders would he discover who could so fit his eyes to all sorts of objects as to see when he pleased the figure and motion of the minute particles in the blood and other juices of animals as distinctly as he does at other times the shape and motion of the animals themselves but to us in our present state unalterable organs so contrived as to discover the figure and motion of the minute parts of bodies whereon depend those sensible qualities we now observe in them would perhaps be of no advantage god has no doubt made them so as is best for us in our present condition he hath fitted us for the neighbourhood of the bodies that surround us and we have to do with and though we cannot by the facul ties we have attain to a perfect knowledge of things yet they will serve us well enough for those ends abovementioned which are our great concernment i beg my readers pardon for laying before him so wild a fancy concerning the ways of perception of beings above us but how extravagant soever it be i doubt whether we can imagine anything about the knowledge of angels but after this manner some way or other in proportion to what we find and observe in ourselves and though we cannot but allow that the infinite power and wisdom of god may frame creatures with a thousand other faculties and ways of perceiving things without them than what we have yet our thoughts can go no further than our own so impossible it is for us to enlarge our very guesses beyond the ideas received from our own sensation and reflection the supposition at least that angels do sometimes assume bodies needs not startle us since some of the most ancient and most learned fathers of the church seemed to believe that they had bodies and this is certain that their state and way of existence is unknown to us our specific ideas of substances but to return to the matter in handthe ideas we have of substances and the ways we come by them i say our specific ideas of substances are nothing else but a collection of a certain number of simple ideas considered as united in one thing these ideas of substances though they are commonly simple apprehensions and the names of them simple terms yet in effect are complex and compounded thus the idea which an englishman signifies by the name swan is white colour long neck red beak black legs and whole feet and all these of a certain size with a power of swimming in the water and making a certain kind of noise and perhaps to a man who has long observed this kind of birds some other properties which all terminate in sensible simple ideas all united in one common subject our ideas of spiritual substances as clear as of bodily substances besides the complex ideas we have of material sensible substances of which i have last spoken by the simple ideas we have taken from those operations of our own minds which we experiment daily in our selves as thinking understanding willing knowing and power of beginning motion c coexisting in some substance we are able to frame the complex idea of an immaterial spirit and thus by putting together the ideas of thinking perceiving liberty and power of moving themselves and other things we have as clear a perception and notion of immaterial substances as we have of material for putting together the ideas of thinking and willing or the power of moving or quieting corporeal motion joined to substance of which we have no distinct idea we have the idea of an immaterial spirit and by putting together the ideas of coherent solid parts and a power of being moved joined with substance of which likewise we have no positive idea we have the idea of matter the one is as clear and distinct an idea as the other the idea of thinking and moving a body being as clear and distinct ideas as the ideas of extension solidity and being moved for our idea of substance is equally obscure or none at all in both it is but a supposed i know not what to support those ideas we call accidents it is for want reflection that we are apt to think that our senses show us nothing but material things every act of sensation when duly considered gives us an equal view of both parts of nature the corporeal and spiritual for whilst i know by seeing or hearing c that there is some corporeal being without me the object of that sensation i do more certainly know that there is some spiritual being within me that sees and hears this i must be convinced cannot be the action of bare insensible matter nor ever could be without an immaterial thinking being no idea of abstract substance either in body or spirit by the complex idea of extended figured coloured and all other sensible qualities which is all that we know of it we are as far from the idea of the substance of body as if we knew nothing at all nor after all the acquaintance and familiarity which we imagine we have with matter and the many qualities men assure themselves they perceive and know in bodies will it perhaps upon examination be found that they have any more or clearer primary ideas belonging to body than they have belonging to immaterial spirit cohesion of solid parts and impulse the primary ideas peculiar to body the primary ideas we have peculiar to body as contradistinguished to spirit are the cohesion of solid and consequently separable parts and a power of communicating motion by impulse these i think are the original ideas proper and peculiar to body for figure is but the consequence of finite extension thinking and motivity the primary ideas peculiar to spirit the ideas we have belonging and peculiar to spirit are thinking and will or a power of putting body into motion by thought and which is consequent to it liberty for as body cannot but communicate its motion by impulse to another body which it meets with at rest so the mind can put bodies into motion or forbear to do so as it pleases the ideas of existence duration and mobility are common to them both spirits capable of motion there is no reason why it should be thought strange that i make mobility belong to spirit for having no other idea of motion but change of distance with other beings that are considered as at rest and finding that spirits as well as bodies cannot operate but where they are and that spirits do operate at several times in several places i cannot but attribute change of place to all finite spirits for of the infinite spirit i speak not here for my soul being a real being as well as my body is certainly as capable of changing distance with any other body or being as body itself and so is capable of motion and if a mathematician can consider a certain distance or a change of that distance between two points one may certainly conceive a distance and a change of distance between two spirits and so conceive their motion their approach or removal one from another proof of this every one finds in himself that his soul can think will and operate on his body in the place where that is but cannot operate on a body or in a place an hundred miles distant from it nobody can imagine that his soul can think or move a body at oxford whilst he is at london and cannot but know that being united to his body it constantly changes place all the whole journey between oxford and london as the coach or horse does that carries him and i think may be said to be truly all that while in motion or if that will not be allowed to afford us a clear idea enough of its motion its being separated from the body in death i think will for to consider it as going out of the body or leaving it and yet to have no idea of its motion seems to me impossible god immoveable because infinite if it be said by any one that it cannot change place because it hath none for the spirits are not in loco but ubi i suppose that way of talking will not now be of much weight to many in an age that is not much disposed to admire or suffer themselves to be deceived by such unintelligible ways of speaking but if any one thinks there is any sense in that distinction and that it is applicable to our present purpose i desire him to put it into intelligible english and then from thence draw a reason to show that immaterial spirits are not capable of motion indeed motion cannot be attributed to god not because he is an immaterial but because he is an infinite spirit our complex idea of an immaterial spirit and our complex idea of body compared let us compare then our complex idea of an immaterial spirit with our complex idea of body and see whether there be any more obscurity in one than in the other and in which most our idea of body as i think is an extended solid substance capable of communicating motion by impulse and our idea of soul as an immaterial spirit is of a substance that thinks and has a power of exciting motion in body by willing or thought these i think are our complex ideas of soul and body as contradistinguished and now let us examine which has most obscurity in it and difficulty to be apprehended i know that people whose thoughts are immersed in matter and have so subjected their minds to their senses that they seldom reflect on anything beyond them are apt to say they cannot comprehend a thinking thing which perhaps is true but i affirm when they consider it well they can no more comprehend an extended thing cohesion of solid parts in body as hard to be conceived as thinking in a soul if any one says he knows not what it is thinks in him he means he knows not what the substance is of that thinking thing no more say i knows he what the substance is of that solid thing further if he says he knows not how he thinks i answer neither knows he how he is extended how the solid parts of body are united or cohere together to make extension for though the pressure of the particles of air may account for the cohesion of several parts of matter that are grosser than the particles of air and have pores less than the corpuscles of air yet the weight or pressure of the air will not explain nor can be a cause of the coherence of the particles of air themselves and if the pressure of the aether or any subtiler matter than the air may unite and hold fast together the parts of a particle of air as well as other bodies yet it cannot make bonds for itself and hold together the parts that make up every the least corpuscle of that materia subtilis so that that hypothesis how ingeniously soever explained by showing that the parts of sensible bodies are held together by the pressure of other external insensible bodies reaches not the parts of the aether itself and by how much the more evident it proves that the parts of other bodies are held together by the external pressure of the aether and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion and union by so much the more it leaves us in the dark concerning the cohesion of the parts of the corpuscles of the aether itself which we can neither conceive without parts they being bodies and divisible nor yet how their parts cohere they wanting that cause of cohesion which is given of the cohesion of the parts of all other bodies not explained by an ambient fluid but in truth the pressure of any ambient fluid how great soever can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid parts of matter for though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished superficies one from another in a line perpendicular to them as in the experiment of two polished marbles yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion in a line parallel to those surfaces because the ambient fluid having a full liberty to succeed in each point of space deserted by a lateral motion resists such a motion of bodies so joined no more than it would resist the motion of that body were it on all sides environed by that fluid and touched no other body and therefore if there were no other cause of cohesion all parts of bodies must be easily separable by such a lateral sliding motion for if the pressure of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion wherever that cause operates not there can be no cohesion and since it cannot operate against a lateral separation as has been shown therefore in every imaginary plane intersecting any mass of matter there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surfaces which will always notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid easily slide one from another so that perhaps how clear an idea soever we think we have of the extension of body which is nothing but the cohesion of solid parts he that shall well consider it in his mind may have reason to conclude that it is as easy for him to have a clear idea how the soul thinks as how body is extended for since body is no further nor otherwise extended than by the union and cohesion of its solid parts we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body without understanding wherein consists the union and cohesion of its parts which seems to me as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking and how it is performed we can as little understand how the parts cohere in extension as how our spirits perceive or move i allow it is usual for most people to wonder how any one should find a difficulty in what they think they every day observe do we not see will they be ready to say the parts of bodies stick firmly together is there anything more common and what doubt can there be made of it and the like i say concerning thinking and voluntary motion do we not every moment experiment it in ourselves and therefore can it be doubted the matter of fact is clear i confess but when we would a little nearer look into it and consider how it is done there i think we are at a loss both in the one and the other and can as little understand how the parts of body cohere as how we ourselves perceive or move i would have any one intelligibly explain to me how the parts of gold or brass that but now in fusion were as loose from one another as the particles of water or the sands of an hourglass come in a few moments to be so united and adhere so strongly one to another that the utmost force of mens arms cannot separate them a considering man will i suppose be here at a loss to satisfy his own or another mans understanding the cause of coherence of atoms in extended substances incomprehensible the little bodies that compose that fluid we call water are so extremely small that i have never heard of any one who by a microscope and yet i have heard of some that have magnified to ten thousand nay to much above a hundred thousand times pretended to perceive their distinct bulk figure or motion and the particles of water are also so perfectly loose one from another that the least force sensibly separates them nay if we consider their perpetual motion we must allow them to have no cohesion one with another and yet let but a sharp cold come and they unite they consolidate these little atoms cohere and are not without great force separable he that could find the bonds that tie these heaps of loose little bodies together so firmly he that could make known the cement that makes them stick so fast one to another would discover a great and yet unknown secret and yet when that was done would he be far enough from making the extension of body which is the cohesion of its solid parts intelligible till he could show wherein consisted the union or consolidation of the parts of those bonds or of that cement or of the least particle of matter that exists whereby it appears that this primary and supposed obvious quality of body will be found when examined to be as incomprehensible as anything belonging to our minds and a solid extended substance as hard to be conceived as a thinking immaterial one whatever difficulties some would raise against it the supposed pressure brought to explain cohesion is unintelligible for to extend our thoughts a little further that pressure which is brought to explain the cohesion of bodies is as unintelligible as the cohesion itself for if matter be considered as no doubt it is finite let any one send his contemplation to the extremities of the universe and there see what conceivable hoops what bond he can imagine to hold this mass of matter in so close a pressure together from whence steel has its firmness and the parts of a diamond their hardness and indissolubility if matter be finite it must have its extremes and there must be something to hinder it from scattering asunder if to avoid this difficulty any one will throw himself into the supposition and abyss of infinite matter let him consider what light he thereby brings to the cohesion of body and whether he be ever the nearer making it intelligible by resolving it into a supposition the most absurd and most incomprehensible of all other so far is our extension of body which is nothing but the cohesion of solid parts from being clearer or more distinct when we would inquire into the nature cause or manner of it than the idea of thinking communication of motion by impulse or by thought equally unintelligible another idea we have of body is the power of communication of motion by impulse and of our souls the power of exciting motion by thought these ideas the one of body the other of our minds every days experience clearly furnishes us with but if here again we inquire how this is done we are equally in the dark for in the communication of motion by impulse wherein as much motion is lost to one body as is got to the other which is the ordinariest case we can have no other conception but of the passing of motion out of one body into another which i think is as obscure and inconceivable as how our minds move or stop our bodies by thought which we every moment find they do the increase of motion by impulse which is observed or believed sometimes to happen is yet harder to be understood we have by daily experience clear evidence of motion produced both by impulse and by thought but the manner how hardly comes within our comprehension we are equally at a loss in both so that however we consider motion and its communication either from body or spirit the idea which belongs to spirit is at least as clear as that which belongs to body and if we consider the active power of moving or as i may call it motivity it is much clearer in spirit than body since two bodies placed by one another at rest will never afford us the idea of a power in the one to move the other but by a borrowed motion whereas the mind every day affords us ideas of an active power of moving of bodies and therefore it is worth our consideration whether active power be not the proper attribute of spirits and passive power of matter hence may be conjectured that created spirits are not totally separate from matter because they are both active and passive pure spirit viz god is only active pure matter is only passive those beings that are both active and passive we may judge to partake of both but be that as it will i think we have as many and as clear ideas belonging to spirit as we have belonging to body the substance of each being equally unknown to us and the idea of thinking in spirit as clear as of extension in body and the communication of motion by thought which we attribute to spirit is as evident as that by impulse which we ascribe to body constant experience makes us sensible of both these though our narrow understandings can comprehend neither for when the mind would look beyond those original ideas we have from sensation or reflection and penetrate into their causes and manner of production we find still it discovers nothing but its own shortsightedness summary to conclude sensation convinces us that there are solid extended substances and reflection that there are thinking ones experience assures us of the existence of such beings and that the one hath a power to move body by impulse the other by thought this we cannot doubt of experience i say every moment furnishes us with the clear ideas both of the one and the other but beyond these ideas as received from their proper sources our faculties will not reach if we would inquire further into their nature causes and manner we perceive not the nature of extension clearer than we do of thinking if we would explain them any further one is as easy as the other and there is no more difficulty to conceive how a substance we know not should by thought set body into motion than how a substance we know not should by impulse set body into motion so that we are no more able to discover wherein the ideas belonging to body consist than those belonging to spirit from whence it seems probable to me that the simple ideas we receive from sensation and reflection are the boundaries of our thoughts beyond which the mind whatever efforts it would make is not able to advance one jot nor can it make any discoveries when it would pry into the nature and hidden causes of those ideas our idea of spirit and our idea of body compared so that in short the idea we have of spirit compared with the idea we have of body stands thus the substance of spirits is unknown to us and so is the substance of body equally unknown to us two primary qualities or properties of body viz solid coherent parts and impulse we have distinct clear ideas of so likewise we know and have distinct clear ideas of two primary qualities or properties of spirit viz thinking and a power of action ie a power of beginning or stopping several thoughts or motions we have also the ideas of several qualities inherent in bodies and have the clear distinct ideas of them which qualities are but the various modifications of the extension of cohering solid parts and their motion we have likewise the ideas of the several modes of thinking viz believing doubting intending fearing hoping all which are but the several modes of thinking we have also the ideas of willing and moving the body consequent to it and with the body itself too for as has been shown spirit is capable of motion the notion of spirit involves no more difficulty in it than that of body lastly if this notion of immaterial spirit may have perhaps some difficulties in it not easily to be explained we have therefore no more reason to deny or doubt the existence of such spirits than we have to deny or doubt the existence of body because the notion of body is cumbered with some difficulties very hard and perhaps impossible to be explained or understood by us for i would fain have instanced anything in our notion of spirit more perplexed or nearer a contradiction than the very notion of body includes in it the divisibility in infinitum of any finite extension involving us whether we grant or deny it in consequences impossible to be explicated or made in our apprehensions consistent consequences that carry greater difficulty and more apparent absurdity than anything can follow from the notion of an immaterial knowing substance we know nothing of things beyond our simple ideas of them which we are not at all to wonder at since we having but some few superficial ideas of things discovered to us only by the senses from without or by the mind reflecting on what it experiments in itself within have no knowledge beyond that much less of the internal constitution and true nature of things being destitute of faculties to attain it and therefore experimenting and discovering in ourselves knowledge and the power of voluntary motion as certainly as we experiment or discover in things without us the cohesion and separation of solid parts which is the extension and motion of bodies we have as much reason to be satisfied with our notion of immaterial spirit as with our notion of body and the existence of the one as well as the other for it being no more a contradiction that thinking should exist separate and independent from solidity than it is a contradiction that solidity should exist separate and independent from thinking they being both but simple ideas independent one from another and having as clear and distinct ideas in us of thinking as of solidity i know not why we may not as well allow a thinking thing without solidity ie immaterial to exist as a solid thing without thinking ie matter to exist especially since it is not harder to conceive how thinking should exist without matter than how matter should think for whensoever we would proceed beyond these simple ideas we have from sensation and reflection and dive further into the nature of things we fall presently into darkness and obscurity perplexedness and difficulties and can discover nothing further but our own blindness and ignorance but whichever of these complex ideas be clearest that of body or immaterial spirit this is evident that the simple ideas that make them up are no other than what we have received from sensation or reflection and so is it of all our other ideas of substances even of god himself our complex idea of god for if we examine the idea we have of the incomprehensible supreme being we shall find that we come by it the same way and that the complex ideas we have both of god and separate spirits are made of the simple ideas we receive from reflection vg having from what we experiment in ourselves got the ideas of existence and duration of knowledge and power of pleasure and happiness and of several other qualities and powers which it is better to have than to be without when we would frame an idea the most suitable we can to the supreme being we enlarge every one of these with our idea of infinity and so putting them together make our complex idea of god for that the mind has such a power of enlarging some of its ideas received from sensation and reflection has been already shown our complex idea of god as infinite if i find that i know some few things and some of them or all perhaps imperfectly i can frame an idea of knowing twice as many which i can double again as often as i can add to number and thus enlarge my idea of knowledge by extending its comprehension to all things existing or possible the same also i can do of knowing them more perfectly ie all their qualities powers causes consequences and relations c till all be perfectly known that is in them or can any way relate to them and thus frame the idea of infinite or boundless knowledge the same may also be done of power till we come to that we call infinite and also of the duration of existence without beginning or end and so frame the idea of an eternal being the degrees or extent wherein we ascribe existence power wisdom and all other perfections which we can have any ideas of to that sovereign being which we call god being all boundless and infinite we frame the best idea of him our minds are capable of all which is done i say by enlarging those simple ideas we have taken from the operations of our own minds by reflection or by our senses from exterior things to that vastness to which infinity can extend them god in his own essence incognisable for it is infinity which joined to our ideas of existence power knowledge c makes that complex idea whereby we represent to ourselves the best we can the supreme being for though in his own essence which certainly we do not know not knowing the real essence of a pebble or a fly or of our own selves god be simple and uncompounded yet i think i may say we have no other idea of him but a complex one of existence knowledge power happiness c infinite and eternal which are all distinct ideas and some of them being relative are again compounded of others all which being as has been shown originally got from sensation and reflection go to make up the idea or notion we have of god no ideas in our complex ideas of spirits but those got from sensation or reflection this further is to be observed that there is no idea we attribute to god bating infinity which is not also a part of our complex idea of other spirits because being capable of no other simple ideas belonging to anything but body but those which by reflection we receive from the operation of our own minds we can attribute to spirits no other but what we receive from thence and all the difference we can put between them in our contemplation of spirits is only in the several extents and degrees of their knowledge power duration happiness c for that in our ideas as well of spirits as of other things we are restrained to those we receive from sensation and reflection is evident from hencethat in our ideas of spirits how much soever advanced in perfection beyond those of bodies even to that of infinite we cannot yet have any idea of the manner wherein they discover their thoughts one to another though we must necessarily conclude that separate spirits which are beings that have perfecter knowledge and greater happiness than we must needs have also a perfecter way of communicating their thoughts than we have who are fain to make use of corporeal signs and particular sounds which are therefore of most general use as being the best and quickest we are capable of but of immediate communication having no experiment in ourselves and consequently no notion of it at all we have no idea how spirits which use not words can with quickness or much less how spirits that have no bodies can be masters of their own thoughts and communicate or conceal them at pleasure though we cannot but necessarily suppose they have such a power recapitulation and thus we have seen what kind of ideas we have of substances of all kinds wherein they consist and how we came by them from whence i think it is very evident first that all our ideas of the several sorts of substances are nothing but collections of simple ideas with a supposition of something to which they belong and in which they subsist though of this supposed something we have no clear distinct idea at all secondly that all the simple ideas that thus united in one common substratum make up our complex ideas of several sorts of substances are no other but such as we have received from sensation or reflection so that even in those which we think we are most intimately acquainted with and that come nearest the comprehension of our most enlarged conceptions we cannot go beyond those simple ideas and even in those which seem most remote from all we have to do with and do infinitely surpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by reflection or discover by sensation in other things we can attain to nothing but those simple ideas which we originally received from sensation or reflection as is evident in the complex ideas we have of angels and particularly of god himself thirdly that most of the simple ideas that make up our complex ideas of substances when truly considered are only powers however we are apt to take them for positive qualities vg the greatest part of the ideas that make our complex idea of gold are yellowness great weight ductility fusibility and solubility in aqua regia c all united together in an unknown substratum all which ideas are nothing else but so many relations to other substances and are not really in the gold considered barely in itself though they depend on those real and primary qualities of its internal constitution whereby it has a fitness differently to operate and be operated on by several other substances of collective ideas of substances a collective idea is one idea besides these complex ideas of several single substances as of man horse gold violet apple c the mind hath also complex collective ideas of substances which i so call because such ideas are made up of many particular substances considered together as united into one idea and which so joined are looked on as one vg the idea of such a collection of men as make an army though consisting of a great number of distinct substances is as much one idea as the idea of a man and the great collective idea of all bodies whatsoever signified by the name world is as much one idea as the idea of any the least particle of matter in it it sufficing to the unity of any idea that it be considered as one representation or picture though made up of ever so many particulars made by the power of composing in the mind these collective ideas of substances the mind makes by its power of composition and uniting severally either simple or complex ideas into one as it does by the same faculty make the complex ideas of particular substances consisting of an aggregate of divers simple ideas united in one substance and as the mind by putting together the repeated ideas of unity makes the collective mode or complex idea of any number as a score or a gross cso by putting together several particular substances it makes collective ideas of substances as a troop an army a swarm a city a fleet each of which every one finds that he represents to his own mind by one idea in one view and so under that notion considers those several things as perfectly one as one ship or one atom nor is it harder to conceive how an army of ten thousand men should make one idea than how a man should make one idea it being as easy to the mind to unite into one the idea of a great number of men and consider it as one as it is to unite into one particular all the distinct ideas that make up the composition of a man and consider them all together as one artificial things that are made up of distinct substances are our collective ideas amongst such kind of collective ideas are to be counted most part of artificial things at least such of them as are made up of distinct substances and in truth if we consider all these collective ideas aright as army constellation universe as they are united into so many single ideas they are but the artificial draughts of the mind bringing things very remote and independent on one another into one view the better to contemplate and discourse of them united into one conception and signified by one name for there are no things so remote nor so contrary which the mind cannot by this art of composition bring into one idea as is visible in that signified by the name universe of relation relation what besides the ideas whether simple or complex that the mind has of things as they are in themselves there are others it gets from their comparison one with another the understanding in the consideration of anything is not confined to that precise object it can carry an idea as it were beyond itself or at least look beyond it to see how it stands in conformity to any other when the mind so considers one thing that it does as it were bring it to and set it by another and carries its view from one to the otherthis is as the words import relation and respect and the denominations given to positive things intimating that respect and serving as marks to lead the thoughts beyond the subject itself denominated to something distinct from it are what we call relatives and the things so brought together related thus when the mind considers caius as such a positive being it takes nothing into that idea but what really exists in caius vg when i consider him as a man i have nothing in my mind but the complex idea of the species man so likewise when i say caius is a white man i have nothing but the bare consideration of a man who hath that white colour but when i give caius the name husband i intimate some other person and when i give him the name whiter i intimate some other thing in both cases my thought is led to something beyond caius and there are two things brought into consideration and since any idea whether simple or complex may be the occasion why the mind thus brings two things together and as it were takes a view of them at once though still considered as distinct therefore any of our ideas may be the foundation of relation as in the abovementioned instance the contract and ceremony of marriage with sempronia is the occasion of the denomination and relation of husband and the colour white the occasion why he is said to be whiter than freestone ideas of relations without correlative terms not easily apprehended these and the like relations expressed by relative terms that have others answering them with a reciprocal intimation as father and son bigger and less cause and effect are very obvious to every one and everybody at first sight perceives the relation for father and son husband and wife and such other correlative terms seem so nearly to belong one to another and through custom do so readily chime and answer one another in peoples memories that upon the naming of either of them the thoughts are presently carried beyond the thing so named and nobody overlooks or doubts of a relation where it is so plainly intimated but where languages have failed to give correlative names there the relation is not always so easily taken notice of concubine is no doubt a relative name as well as a wife but in languages where this and the like words have not a correlative term there people are not so apt to take them to be so as wanting that evident mark of relation which is between correlatives which seem to explain one another and not to be able to exist but together hence it is that many of those names which duly considered do include evident relations have been called external denominations but all names that are more than empty sounds must signify some idea which is either in the thing to which the name is applied and then it is positive and is looked on as united to and existing in the thing to which the denomination is given or else it arises from the respect the mind finds in it to something distinct from it with which it considers it and then it includes a relation some seemingly absolute terms contain relations another sort of relative terms there is which are not looked on to be either relative or so much as external denominations which yet under the form and appearance of signifying something absolute in the subject do conceal a tacit though less observable relation such are the seemingly positive terms of old great imperfect c whereof i shall have occasion to speak more at large in the following chapters relation different from the things related this further may be observed that the ideas of relation may be the same in men who have far different ideas of the things that are related or that are thus compared vg those who have far different ideas of a man may yet agree in the notion of a father which is a notion superinduced to the substance or man and refers only to an act of that thing called man whereby he contributed to the generation of one of his own kind let man be what it will change of relation may be without any change in the things related the nature therefore of relation consists in the referring or comparing two things one to another from which comparison one or both comes to be denominated and if either of those things be removed or cease to be the relation ceases and the denomination consequent to it though the other receive in itself no alteration at all vg caius whom i consider today as a father ceases to be so tomorrow only by the death of his son without any alteration made in himself nay barely by the minds changing the object to which it compares anything the same thing is capable of having contrary denominations at the same time vg caius compared to several persons may be truly be said to be older and younger stronger and weaker c relation only betwixt two things whatsoever doth or can exist or be considered as one thing is positive and so not only simple ideas and substances but modes also are positive beings though the parts of which they consist are very often relative one to another but the whole together considered as one thing and producing in us the complex idea of one thing which idea is in our minds as one picture though an aggregate of divers parts and under one name it is a positive or absolute thing or idea thus a triangle though the parts thereof compared one to another be relative yet the idea of the whole is a positive absolute idea the same may be said of a family a tune c for there can be no relation but betwixt two things considered as two things there must always be in relation two ideas or things either in themselves really separate or considered as distinct and then a ground or occasion for their comparison all things capable of relation concerning relation in general these things may be considered first that there is no one thing whether simple idea substance mode or relation or name of either of them which is not capable of almost an infinite number of considerations in reference to other things and therefore this makes no small part of mens thoughts and words vg one single man may at once be concerned in and sustain all these following relations and many more viz father brother son grandfather grandson fatherinlaw soninlaw husband friend enemy subject general judge patron client professor european englishman islander servant master possessor captain superior inferior bigger less older younger contemporary like unlike c to an almost infinite number he being capable of as many relations as there can be occasions of comparing him to other things in any manner of agreement disagreement or respect whatsoever for as i said relation is a way of comparing or considering two things together and giving one or both of them some appellation from that comparison and sometimes giving even the relation itself a name our ideas of relations often clearer than of the subjects related secondly this further may be considered concerning relation that though it be not contained in the real existence of things but something extraneous and superinduced yet the ideas which relative words stand for are often clearer and more distinct than of those substances to which they do belong the notion we have of a father or brother is a great deal clearer and more distinct than that we have of a man or if you will paternity is a thing whereof it is easier to have a clear idea than of humanity and i can much easier conceive what a friend is than what god because the knowledge of one action or one simple idea is oftentimes sufficient to give me the notion of a relation but to the knowing of any substantial being an accurate collection of sundry ideas is necessary a man if he compares two things together can hardly be supposed not to know what it is wherein he compares them so that when he compares any things together he cannot but have a very clear idea of that relation the ideas then of relations are capable at least of being more perfect and distinct in our minds than those of substances because it is commonly hard to know all the simple ideas which are really in any substance but for the most part easy enough to know the simple ideas that make up any relation i think on or have a name for vg comparing two men in reference to one common parent it is very easy to frame the ideas of brothers without having yet the perfect idea of a man for significant relative words as well as others standing only for ideas and those being all either simple or made up of simple ones it suffices for the knowing the precise idea the relative term stands for to have a clear conception of that which is the foundation of the relation which may be done without having a perfect and clear idea of the thing it is attributed to thus having the notion that one laid the egg out of which the other was hatched i have a clear idea of the relation of dam and chick between the two cassiowaries in st jamess park though perhaps i have but a very obscure and imperfect idea of those birds themselves relations all terminate in simple ideas thirdly though there be a great number of considerations wherein things may be compared one with another and so a multitude of relations yet they all terminate in and are concerned about those simple ideas either of sensation or reflection which i think to be the whole materials of all our knowledge to clear this i shall show it in the most considerable relations that we have any notion of and in some that seem to be the most remote from sense or reflection which yet will appear to have their ideas from thence and leave it past doubt that the notions we have of them are but certain simple ideas and so originally derived from sense or reflection terms leading the mind beyond the subject denominated are relative fourthly that relation being the considering of one thing with another which is extrinsical to it it is evident that all words that necessarily lead the mind to any other ideas than are supposed really to exist in that thing to which the words are applied are relative words vg a man black merry thoughtful thirsty angry extended these and the like are all absolute because they neither signify nor intimate anything but what does or is supposed really to exist in the man thus denominated but father brother king husband blacker merrier c are words which together with the thing they denominate imply also something else separate and exterior to the existence of that thing all relatives made up of simple ideas having laid down these premises concerning relation in general i shall now proceed to show in some instances how all the ideas we have of relation are made up as the others are only of simple ideas and that they all how refined or remote from sense soever they seem terminate at last in simple ideas i shall begin with the most comprehensive relation wherein all things that do or can exist are concerned and that is the relation of cause and effect the idea whereof how derived from the two fountains of all our knowledge sensation and reflection i shall in the next place consider of cause and effect and other relations whence the ideas of cause and effect got in the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of things we cannot but observe that several particular both qualities and substances begin to exist and that they receive this their existence from the due application and operation of some other being from this observation we get our ideas of cause and effect that which produces any simple or complex idea we denote by the general name cause and that which is produced effect thus finding that in that substance which we call wax fluidity which is a simple idea that was not in it before is constantly produced by the application of a certain degree of heat we call the simple idea of heat in relation to fluidity in wax the cause of it and fluidity the effect so also finding that the substance wood which is a certain collection of simple ideas so called by the application of fire is turned into another substance called ashes ie another complex idea consisting of a collection of simple ideas quite different from that complex idea which we call wood we consider fire in relation to ashes as cause and the ashes as effect so that whatever is considered by us to conduce or operate to the producing any particular simple idea or collection of simple ideas whether substance or mode which did not before exist hath thereby in our minds the relation of a cause and so is denominated by us creation generation making alteration having thus from what our senses are able to discover in the operations of bodies on one another got the notion of cause and effect viz that a cause is that which makes any other thing either simple idea substance or mode begin to be and an effect is that which had its beginning from some other thing the mind finds no great difficulty to distinguish the several originals of things into two sorts first when the thing is wholly made new so that no part thereof did ever exist before as when a new particle of matter doth begin to exist in rerum natura which had before no being and this we call creation secondly when a thing is made up of particles which did all of them before exist but that very thing so constituted of preexisting particles which considered all together make up such a collection of simple ideas had not any existence before as this man this egg rose or cherry c and this when referred to a substance produced in the ordinary course of nature by internal principle but set on work by and received from some external agent or cause and working by insensible ways which we perceive not we call generation when the cause is extrinsical and the effect produced by a sensible separation or juxtaposition of discernible parts we call it making and such are all artificial things when any simple idea is produced which was not in that subject before we call it alteration thus a man is generated a picture made and either of them altered when any new sensible quality or simple idea is produced in either of them which was not there before and the things thus made to exist which were not there before are effects and those things which operated to the existence causes in which and all other cases we may observe that the notion of cause and effect has its rise from ideas received by sensation or reflection and that this relation how comprehensive soever terminates at last in them for to have the idea of cause and effect it suffices to consider any simple idea or substance as beginning to exist by the operation of some other without knowing the manner of that operation relations of time time and place are also the foundations of very large relations and all finite beings at least are concerned in them but having already shown in another place how we get those ideas it may suffice here to intimate that most of the denominations of things received from time are only relations thus when any one says that queen elizabeth lived sixtynine and reigned fortyfive years these words import only the relation of that duration to some other and mean no more but this that the duration of her existence was equal to sixtynine and the duration of her government to fortyfive annual revolutions of the sun and so are all words answering how long again william the conqueror invaded england about the year which means this that taking the duration from our saviours time till now for one entire great length of time it shows at what distance this invasion was from the two extremes and so do all words of time answering to the question when which show only the distance of any point of time from the period of a longer duration from which we measure and to which we thereby consider it as related some ideas of time supposed positive and found to be relative there are yet besides those other words of time that ordinarily are thought to stand for positive ideas which yet will when considered be found to be relative such as are young old c which include and intimate the relation anything has to a certain length of duration whereof we have the idea in our minds thus having settled in our thoughts the idea of the ordinary duration of a man to be seventy years when we say a man is young we mean that his age is yet but a small part of that which usually men attain to and when we denominate him old we mean that his duration is run out almost to the end of that which men do not usually exceed and so it is but comparing the particular age or duration of this or that man to the idea of that duration which we have in our minds as ordinarily belonging to that sort of animals which is plain in the application of these names to other things for a man is called young at twenty years and very young at seven years old but yet a horse we call old at twenty and a dog at seven years because in each of these we compare their age to different ideas of duration which are settled in our minds as belonging to these several sorts of animals in the ordinary course of nature but the sun and stars though they have outlasted several generations of men we call not old because we do not know what period god hath set to that sort of beings this term belonging properly to those things which we can observe in the ordinary course of things by a natural decay to come to an end in a certain period of time and so have in our minds as it were a standard to which we can compare the several parts of their duration and by the relation they bear thereunto call them young or old which we cannot therefore do to a ruby or a diamond things whose usual periods we know not relations of place and extension the relation also that things have to one another in their places and distances is very obvious to observe as above below a mile distant from charingcross in england and in london but as in duration so in extension and bulk there are some ideas that are relative which we signify by names that are thought positive as great and little are truly relations for here also having by observation settled in our minds the ideas of the bigness of several species of things from those we have been most accustomed to we make them as it were the standards whereby to denominate the bulk of others thus we call a great apple such a one as is bigger than the ordinary sort of those we have been used to and a little horse such a one as comes not up to the size of that idea which we have in our minds to belong ordinarily to horses and that will be a great horse to a welchman which is but a little one to a fleming they two having from the different breed of their countries taken severalsized ideas to which they compare and in relation to which they denominate their great and their little absolute terms often stand for relations so likewise weak and strong are but relative denominations of power compared to some ideas we have at that time of greater or less power thus when we say a weak man we mean one that has not so much strength or power to move as usually men have or usually those of his size have which is a comparing his strength to the idea we have of the usual strength of men or men of such a size the like when we say the creatures are all weak things weak there is but a relative term signifying the disproportion there is in the power of god and the creatures and so abundance of words in ordinary speech stand only for relations and perhaps the greatest part which at first sight seem to have no such signification vg the ship has necessary stores necessary and stores are both relative words one having a relation to the accomplishing the voyage intended and the other to future use all which relations how they are confined to and terminate in ideas derived from sensation or reflection is too obvious to need any explication of identity and diversity wherein identity consists another occasion the mind often takes of comparing is the very being of things when considering anything as existing at any determined time and place we compare it with itself existing at another time and thereon form the ideas of identity and diversity when we see anything to be in any place in any instant of time we are sure be it what it will that it is that very thing and not another which at that same time exists in another place how like and undistinguishable soever it may be in all other respects and in this consists identity when the ideas it is attributed to vary not at all from what they were that moment wherein we consider their former existence and to which we compare the present for we never finding nor conceiving it possible that two things of the same kind should exist in the same place at the same time we rightly conclude that whatever exists anywhere at any time excludes all of the same kind and is there itself alone when therefore we demand whether anything be the same or no it refers always to something that existed such a time in such a place which it was certain at that instant was the same with itself and no other from whence it follows that one thing cannot have two beginnings of existence nor two things one beginning it being impossible for two things of the same kind to be or exist in the same instant in the very same place or one and the same thing in different places that therefore that had one beginning is the same thing and that which had a different beginning in time and place from that is not the same but diverse that which has made the difficulty about this relation has been the little care and attention used in having precise notions of the things to which it is attributed identity of substances we have the ideas but of three sorts of substances god finite intelligences bodies first god is without beginning eternal unalterable and everywhere and therefore concerning his identity there can be no doubt secondly finite spirits having had each its determinate time and place of beginning to exist the relation to that time and place will always determine to each of them its identity as long as it exists thirdly the same will hold of every particle of matter to which no addition or subtraction of matter being made it is the same for though these three sorts of substances as we term them do not exclude one another out of the same place yet we cannot conceive but that they must necessarily each of them exclude any of the same kind out of the same place or else the notions and names of identity and diversity would be in vain and there could be no such distinctions of substances or anything else one from another for example could two bodies be in the same place at the same time then those two parcels of matter must be one and the same take them great or little nay all bodies must be one and the same for by the same reason that two particles of matter may be in one place all bodies may be in one place which when it can be supposed takes away the distinction of identity and diversity of one and more and renders it ridiculous but it being a contradiction that two or more should be one identity and diversity are relations and ways of comparing well founded and of use to the understanding identity of modes and relations all other things being but modes or relations ultimately terminated in substances the identity and diversity of each particular existence of them too will be by the same way determined only as to things whose existence is in succession such as are the actions of finite beings vg motion and thought both which consist in a continued train of succession concerning their diversity there can be no question because each perishing the moment it begins they cannot exist in different times or in different places as permanent beings can at different times exist in distant places and therefore no motion or thought considered as at different times can be the same each part thereof having a different beginning of existence principium individuationis from what has been said it is easy to discover what is so much inquired after the principium individuationis and that it is plain is existence itself which determines a being of any sort to a particular time and place incommunicable to two beings of the same kind this though it seems easier to conceive in simple substances or modes yet when reflected on is not more difficult in compound ones if care be taken to what it is applied vg let us suppose an atom ie a continued body under one immutable superficies existing in a determined time and place it is evident that considered in any instant of its existence it is in that instant the same with itself for being at that instant what it is and nothing else it is the same and so must continue as long as its existence is continued for so long it will be the same and no other in like manner if two or more atoms be joined together into the same mass every one of those atoms will be the same by the foregoing rule and whilst they exist united together the mass consisting of the same atoms must be the same mass or the same body let the parts be ever so differently jumbled but if one of these atoms be taken away or one new one added it is no longer the same mass or the same body in the state of living creatures their identity depends not on a mass of the same particles but on something else for in them the variation of great parcels of matter alters not the identity an oak growing from a plant to a great tree and then lopped is still the same oak and a colt grown up to a horse sometimes fat sometimes lean is all the while the same horse though in both these cases there may be a manifest change of the parts so that truly they are not either of them the same masses of matter though they be truly one of them the same oak and the other the same horse the reason whereof is that in these two casesa mass of matter and a living bodyidentity is not applied to the same thing identity of vegetables we must therefore consider wherein an oak differs from a mass of matter and that seems to me to be in this that the one is only the cohesion of particles of matter any how united the other such a disposition of them as constitutes the parts of an oak and such an organization of those parts as is fit to receive and distribute nourishment so as to continue and frame the wood bark and leaves c of an oak in which consists the vegetable life that being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body partaking of one common life it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant in a like continued organization conformable to that sort of plants for this organization being at any one instant in any one collection of matter is in that particular concrete distinguished from all other and is that individual life which existing constantly from that moment both forwards and backwards in the same continuity of insensibly succeeding parts united to the living body of the plant it has that identity which makes the same plant and all the parts of it parts of the same plant during all the time that they exist united in that continued organization which is fit to convey that common life to all the parts so united identity of animals the case is not so much different in brutes but that any one may hence see what makes an animal and continues it the same something we have like this in machines and may serve to illustrate it for example what is a watch it is plain it is nothing but a fit organization or construction of parts to a certain end which when a sufficient force is added to it it is capable to attain if we would suppose this machine one continued body all whose organized parts were repaired increased or diminished by a constant addition or separation of insensible parts with one common life we should have something very much like the body of an animal with this difference that in an animal the fitness of the organization and the motion wherein life consists begin together the motion coming from within but in machines the force coming sensibly from without is often away when the organ is in order and well fitted to receive it the identity of man this also shows wherein the identity of the same man consists viz in nothing but a participation of the same continued life by constantly fleeting particles of matter in succession vitally united to the same organized body he that shall place the identity of man in anything else but like that of other animals in one fitly organized body taken in any one instant and from thence continued under one organization of life in several successively fleeting particles of matter united to it will find it hard to make an embryo one of years mad and sober the same man by any supposition that will not make it possible for seth ismael socrates pilate st austin and caesar borgia to be the same man for if the identity of soul alone makes the same man and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same individual spirit may not be united to different bodies it will be possible that those men living in distant ages and of different tempers may have been the same man which way of speaking must be from a very strange use of the word man applied to an idea out of which body and shape are excluded and that way of speaking would agree yet worse with the notions of those philosophers who allow of transmigration and are of opinion that the souls of men may for their miscarriages be detruded into the bodies of beasts as fit habitations with organs suited to the satisfaction of their brutal inclinations but yet i think nobody could he be sure that the soul of heliogabalus were in one of his hogs would yet say that hog were a man or heliogabalus idea of identity suited to the idea it is applied to it is not therefore unity of substance that comprehends all sorts of identity or will determine it in every case but to conceive and judge of it aright we must consider what idea the word it is applied to stands for it being one thing to be the same substance another the same man and a third the same person if person man and substance are three names standing for three different ideasfor such as is the idea belonging to that name such must be the identity which if it had been a little more carefully attended to would possibly have prevented a great deal of that confusion which often occurs about this matter with no small seeming difficulties especially concerning personal identity which therefore we shall in the next place a little consider same man an animal is a living organized body and consequently the same animal as we have observed is the same continued life communicated to different particles of matter as they happen successively to be united to that organized living body and whatever is talked of other definitions ingenious observation puts it past doubt that the idea in our minds of which the sound man in our mouths is the sign is nothing else but of an animal of such a certain form since i think i may be confident that whoever should see a creature of his own shape or make though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot would call him still a man or whoever should hear a cat or a parrot discourse reason and philosophize would call or think it nothing but a cat or a parrot and say the one was a dull irrational man and the other a very intelligent rational parrot a relation we have in an author of great note is sufficient to countenance the supposition of a rational parrot his words are i had a mind to know from prince maurices own mouth the account of a common but much credited story that i had heard so often from many others of an old parrot he had in brazil during his government there that spoke and asked and an swered common questions like a reasonable creature so that those of his train there generally concluded it to be witchery or possession and one of his chaplains who lived long afterwards in holland would never from that time endure a parrot but said they all had a devil in them i had heard many particulars of this story and as severed by people hard to be discredited which made me ask prince maurice what there was of it he said with his usual plainness and dryness in talk there was something true but a great deal false of what had been reported i desired to know of him what there was of the first he told me short and coldly that he had heard of such an old parrot when he had been at brazil and though he believed nothing of it and it was a good way off yet he had so much curiosity as to send for it that it was a very great and a very old one and when it came first into the room where the prince was with a great many dutchmen about him it said presently what a company of white men are here they asked it what it thought that man was pointing to the prince it answered some general or other when they brought it close to him he asked it dou venezvous it answered de marinnan the prince a qui estesvous the parrot a un portugais the prince que faistu la parrot je garde les poulles the prince laughed and said vous gardez les poulles the parrot answered oui moi et je scai bien faire and made the chuck four or five times that people use to make to chickens when they call them i set down the words of this worthy dialogue in french just as prince maurice said them to me i asked him in what language the parrot spoke and he said in brazilian i asked whether he understood brazilian he said no but he had taken care to have two interpreters by him the one a dutchman that spoke brazilian and the other a brazilian that spoke dutch that he asked them separately and privately and both of them agreed in telling him just the same thing that the parrot had said i could not but tell this odd story because it is so much out of the way and from the first hand and what may pass for a good one for i dare say this prince at least believed himself in all he told me having ever passed for a very honest and pious man i leave it to naturalists to reason and to other men to believe as they please upon it however it is not perhaps amiss to relieve or enliven a busy scene sometimes with such digressions whether to the purpose or no i have taken care that the reader should have the story at large in the authors own words because he seems to me not to have thought it incredible for it cannot be imagined that so able a man as he who had sufficiency enough to warrant all the testimonies he gives of himself should take so much pains in a place where it had nothing to do to pin so close not only on a man whom he mentions as his friend but on a prince in whom he acknowledges very great honesty and piety a story which if he himself thought incredible he could not but also think ridiculous the prince it is plain who vouches this story and our author who relates it from him both of them call this talker a parrot and i ask any one else who thinks such a story fit to be told whether if this parrot and all of its kind had always talked as we have a princes word for it this one didwhether i say they would not have passed for a race of rational animals but yet whether for all that they would have been allowed to be men and not parrots for i presume it is not the idea of a thinking or rational being alone that makes the idea of a man in most peoples sense but of a body so and so shaped joined to it and if that be the idea of a man the same successive body not shifted all at once must as well as the same immaterial spirit go to the making of the same man personal identity this being premised to find wherein personal identity consists we must consider what person stands forwhich i think is a thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself the same thinking thing in different times and places which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking and as it seems to me essential to it it being impossible for any one to perceive without perceiving that he does perceive when we see hear smell taste feel meditate or will anything we know that we do so thus it is always as to our present sensations and perceptions and by this every one is to himself that which he calls selfit not being considered in this case whether the same self be continued in the same or divers substances for since consciousness always accompanies thinking and it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things in this alone consists personal identity ie the sameness of a rational being and as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought so far reaches the identity of that person it is the same self now it was then and it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it that that action was done consciousness makes personal identity but it is further inquired whether it be the same identical substance this few would think they had reason to doubt of if these perceptions with their consciousness always remained present in the mind whereby the same thinking thing would be always consciously present and as would be thought evidently the same to itself but that which seems to make the difficulty is this that this consciousness being interrupted always by forgetfulness there being no moment of our lives wherein we have the whole train of all our past actions before our eyes in one view but even the best memories losing the sight of one part whilst they are viewing another and we sometimes and that the greatest part of our lives not reflecting on our past selves being intent on our present thoughts and in sound sleep having no thoughts at all or at least none with that consciousness which remarks our waking thoughtsi say in all these cases our consciousness being interrupted and we losing the sight of our past selves doubts are raised whether we are the same thinking thing ie the same substance or no which however reasonable or unreasonable concerns not personal identity at all the question being what makes the same person and not whether it be the same identical substance which always thinks in the same person which in this case matters not at all different substances by the same consciousness where they do partake in it being united into one person as well as different bodies by the same life are united into one animal whose identity is preserved in that change of substances by the unity of one continued life for it being the same consciousness that makes a man be himself to himself personal identity depends on that only whether it be annexed solely to one individual substance or can be continued in a succession of several substances for as far as any intelligent being can repeat the idea of any past action with the same consciousness it had of it at first and with the same consciousness it has of any present action so far it is the same personal self for it is by the consciousness it has of its present thoughts and actions that it is self to itself now and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to actions past or to come and would be by distance of time or change of substance no more two persons than a man be two men by wearing other clothes today than he did yesterday with a long or a short sleep between the same consciousness uniting those distant actions into the same person whatever substances contributed to their production personal identity in change of substance that this is so we have some kind of evidence in our very bodies all whose particles whilst vitally united to this same thinking conscious self so that we feel when they are touched and are affected by and conscious of good or harm that happens to them as a part of ourselves ie of our thinking conscious self thus the limbs of his body are to every one a part of himself he sympathizes and is concerned for them cut off a hand and thereby separate it from that consciousness he had of its heat cold and other affections and it is then no longer a part of that which is himself any more than the remotest part of matter thus we see the substance whereof personal self consisted at one time may be varied at another without the change of personal identity there being no question about the same person though the limbs which but now were a part of it be cut off personality in change of substance but the question is whether if the same substance which thinks be changed it can be the same person or remaining the same it can be different persons and to this i answer first this can be no question at all to those who place thought in a purely material animal constitution void of an immaterial substance for whether their supposition be true or no it is plain they conceive personal identity preserved in something else than identity of substance as animal identity is preserved in identity of life and not of substance and therefore those who place thinking in an immaterial substance only before they can come to deal with these men must show why personal identity cannot be preserved in the change of immaterial substances or variety of particular immaterial substances as well as animal identity is preserved in the change of material substances or variety of particular bodies unless they will say it is one immaterial spirit that makes the same life in brutes as it is one immaterial spirit that makes the same person in men which the cartesians at least will not admit for fear of making brutes thinking things too whether in change of thinking substances there can be one person but next as to the first part of the question whether if the same thinking substance supposing immaterial substances only to think be changed it can be the same person i answer that cannot be resolved but by those who know what kind of substances they are that do think and whether the consciousness of past actions can be transferred from one thinking substance to another i grant were the same consciousness the same individual action it could not but it being a present representation of a past action why it may not be possible that that may be represented to the mind to have been which really never was will remain to be shown and therefore how far the consciousness of past actions is annexed to any individual agent so that another cannot possibly have it will be hard for us to determine till we know what kind of action it is that cannot be done without a reflex act of perception accompanying it and how performed by thinking substances who cannot think without being conscious of it but that which we call the same consciousness not being the same individual act why one intellectual substance may not have represented to it as done by itself what it never did and was perhaps done by some other agentwhy i say such a representation may not possibly be without reality of matter of fact as well as sev eral representations in dreams are which yet whilst dreaming we take for truewill be difficult to conclude from the nature of things and that it never is so will by us till we have clearer views of the nature of thinking substances be best resolved into the goodness of god who as far as the happiness or misery of any of his sensible creatures is concerned in it will not by a fatal error of theirs transfer from one to another that consciousness which draws reward or punishment with it how far this may be an argument against those who would place thinking in a system of fleeting animal spirits i leave to be considered but yet to return to the question before us it must be allowed that if the same consciousness which as has been shown is quite a different thing from the same numerical figure or motion in body can be transferred from one thinking substance to another it will be possible that two thinking substances may make but one person for the same consciousness being preserved whether in the same or different substances the personal identity is preserved whether the same immaterial substance remaining there can be two persons as to the second part of the question whether the same immaterial substance remaining there may be two distinct persons which question seems to me to be built on thiswhether the same immaterial being being conscious of the action of its past duration may be wholly stripped of all the consciousness of its past existence and lose it beyond the power of ever retrieving it again and so as it were beginning a new account from a new period have a consciousness that cannot reach beyond this new state all those who hold preexistence are evidently of this mind since they allow the soul to have no remaining consciousness of what it did in that preexistent state either wholly separate from body or informing any other body and if they should not it is plain experience would be against them so that personal identity reaching no further than consciousness reaches a preexistent spirit not having continued so many ages in a state of silence must needs make different persons suppose a christian platonist or a pythagorean should upon gods having ended all his works of creation the seventh day think his soul hath existed ever since and should imagine it has revolved in several human bodies as i once met with one who was persuaded his had been the soul of socrates how reasonably i will not dispute this i know that in the post he filled which was no inconsiderable one he passed for a very rational man and the press has shown that he wanted not parts or learning would any one say that he being not conscious of any of socratess actions or thoughts could be the same person with socrates let any one reflect upon himself and conclude that he has in himself an immaterial spirit which is that which thinks in him and in the constant change of his body keeps him the same and is that which he calls himself let him also suppose it to be the same soul that was in nestor or thersites at the siege of troy for souls being as far as we know anything of them in their nature indifferent to any parcel of matter the supposition has no apparent absurdity in it which it may have been as well as it is now the soul of any other man but he now having no consciousness of any of the actions either of nestor or thersites does or can he conceive himself the same person with either of them can he be concerned in either of their actions attribute them to himself or think them his own more than the actions of any other men that ever existed so that this consciousness not reaching to any of the actions of either of those men he is no more one self with either of them than if the soul or immaterial spirit that now informs him had been created and began to exist when it began to inform his present body though it were never so true that the same spirit that informed nestors or thersites body were numerically the same that now informs his for this would no more make him the same person with nestor than if some of the particles of matter that were once a part of nestor were now a part of this man the same immaterial substance without the same consciousness no more making the same person by being united to any body than the same particle of matter without consciousness united to any body makes the same person but let him once find himself conscious of any of the actions of nestor he then finds himself the same person with nestor the body as well as the soul goes to the making of a man and thus may we be able without any difficulty to conceive the same person at the resurrection though in a body not exactly in make or parts the same which he had herethe same consciousness going along with the soul that inhabits it but yet the soul alone in the change of bodies would scarce to any one but to him that makes the soul the man be enough to make the same man for should the soul of a prince carrying with it the consciousness of the princes past life enter and inform the body of a cobbler as soon as deserted by his own soul every one sees he would be the same person with the prince accountable only for the princes actions but who would say it was the same man the body too goes to the making the man and would i guess to everybody determine the man in this case wherein the soul with all its princely thoughts about it would not make another man but he would be the same cobbler to every one besides himself i know that in the ordinary way of speaking the same person and the same man stand for one and the same thing and indeed every one will always have a liberty to speak as he pleases and to apply what articulate sounds to what ideas he thinks fit and change them as often as he pleases but yet when we will inquire what makes the same spirit man or person we must fix the ideas of spirit man or person in our minds and having resolved with ourselves what we mean by them it will not be hard to determine in either of them or the like when it is the same and when not consciousness alone unites actions into the same person but though the same immaterial substance or soul does not alone wherever it be and in whatsoever state make the same man yet it is plain consciousness as far as ever it can be extendedshould it be to ages pastunites existences and actions very remote in time into the same person as well as it does the existences and actions of the immediately preceding moment so that whatever has the consciousness of present and past actions is the same person to whom they both belong had i the same consciousness that i saw the ark and noahs flood as that i saw an overflowing of the thames last winter or as that i write now i could no more doubt that i who write this now that saw the thames overflowed last winter and that viewed the flood at the general deluge was the same selfplace that self in what substance you pleasethan that i who write this am the same myself now whilst i write whether i consist of all the same substance material or immaterial or no that i was yesterday for as to this point of being the same self it matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or other substancesi being as much concerned and as justly accountable for any action that was done a thousand years since appropriated to me now by this selfconsciousness as i am for what i did the last moment self depends on consciousness not on substance self is that conscious thinking thingwhatever substance made up of whether spiritual or material simple or compounded it matters notwhich is sensible or conscious of pleasure and pain capable of happiness or misery and so is concerned for itself as far as that consciousness extends thus every one finds that whilst comprehended under that consciousness the little finger is as much a part of himself as what is most so upon separation of this little finger should this consciousness go along with the little finger and leave the rest of the body it is evident the little finger would be the person the same person and self then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body as in this case it is the consciousness that goes along with the substance when one part is separate from another which makes the same person and constitutes this inseparable self so it is in reference to substances remote in time that with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join itself makes the same person and is one self with it and with nothing else and so attributes to itself and owns all the actions of that thing as its own as far as that consciousness reaches and no further as every one who reflects will perceive persons not substances the objects of reward and punishment in this personal identity is founded all the right and justice of reward and punishment happiness and misery being that for which every one is concerned for himself and not mattering what becomes of any substance not joined to or affected with that consciousness for as it is evident in the instance i gave but now if the consciousness went along with the little finger when it was cut off that would be the same self which was concerned for the whole body yesterday as making part of itself whose actions then it cannot but admit as its own now though if the same body should still live and immediately from the separation of the little finger have its own peculiar consciousness whereof the little finger knew nothing it would not at all be concerned for it as a part of itself or could own any of its actions or have any of them imputed to him which shows wherein personal identity consists this may show us wherein personal identity consists not in the identity of substance but as i have said in the identity of consciousness wherein if socrates and the present mayor of queinborough agree they are the same person if the same socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of the same consciousness socrates waking and sleeping is not the same person and to punish socrates waking for what sleeping socrates thought and waking socrates was never conscious of would be no more of right than to punish one twin for what his brothertwin did whereof he knew nothing because their outsides were so like that they could not be distinguished for such twins have been seen absolute oblivion separates what is thus forgotten from the person but not from the man but yet possibly it will still be objectedsuppose i wholly lose the memory of some parts of my life beyond a possibility of retrieving them so that perhaps i shall never be conscious of them again yet am i not the same person that did those actions had those thoughts that i once was conscious of though i have now forgot them to which i answer that we must here take notice what the word i is applied to which in this case is the man only and the same man being presumed to be the same person i is easily here supposed to stand also for the same person but if it be possible for the same man to have distinct incommunicable consciousness at different times it is past doubt the same man would at different times make different persons which we see is the sense of mankind in the solemnest declaration of their opinions human laws not punishing the mad man for the sober mans actions nor the sober man for what the mad man didthereby making them two persons which is somewhat explained by our way of speaking in english when we say such an one is not himself or is beside himself in which phrases it is insinuated as if those who now or at least first used them thought that self was changed the selfsame person was no longer in that man difference between identity of man and of person but yet it is hard to conceive that socrates the same individual man should be two persons to help us a little in this we must consider what is meant by socrates or the same individual man first it must be either the same individual immaterial thinking substance in short the same numerical soul and nothing else secondly or the same animal without any regard to an immaterial soul thirdly or the same immaterial spirit united to the same animal now take which of these suppositions you please it is impossible to make personal identity to consist in anything but consciousness or reach any further than that does for by the first of them it must be allowed possible that a man born of different women and in distant times may be the same man a way of speaking which whoever admits must allow it possible for the same man to be two distinct persons as any two that have lived in different ages without the knowledge of one anothers thoughts by the second and third socrates in this life and after it cannot be the same man any way but by the same consciousness and so making human identity to consist in the same thing wherein we place personal identity there will be no difficulty to allow the same man to be the same person but then they who place human identity in consciousness only and not in something else must consider how they will make the infant socrates the same man with socrates after the resurrection but whatsoever to some men makes a man and consequently the same individual man wherein per haps few are agreed personal identity can by us be placed in nothing but consciousness which is that alone which makes what we call self without involving us in great absurdities but is not a man drunk and sober the same person why else is he punished for the fact he commits when drunk though he be never afterwards conscious of it just as much the same person as a man that walks and does other things in his sleep is the same person and is answerable for any mischief he shall do in it human laws punish both with a justice suitable to their way of knowledgebecause in these cases they cannot distinguish certainly what is real what counterfeit and so the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep is not admitted as a plea for though punishment be annexed to personality and personality to consciousness and the drunkard perhaps be not conscious of what he did yet human judicatures justly punish him because the fact is proved against him but want of consciousness cannot be proved for him but in the great day wherein the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open it may be reasonable to think no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of but shall receive his doom his conscience accusing or excusing him consciousness alone unites remote existences into one person nothing but consciousness can unite remote existences into the same person the identity of substance will not do it for whatever substance there is however framed without consciousness there is no person and a carcass may be a person as well as any sort of substance be so without consciousness could we suppose two distinct incommunicable consciousnesses acting the same body the one constantly by day the other by night and on the other side the same consciousness acting by intervals two distinct bodies i ask in the first case whether the day and the nightman would not be two as distinct persons as socrates and plato and whether in the second case there would not be one person in two distinct bodies as much as one man is the same in two distinct clothings nor is it at all material to say that this same and this distinct consciousness in the cases above mentioned is owing to the same and distinct immaterial substances bringing it with them to those bodies which whether true or no alters not the case since it is evident the personal identity would equally be determined by the consciousness whether that consciousness were annexed to some individual immaterial substance or no for granting that the thinking substance in man must be necessarily supposed immaterial it is evident that immaterial thinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness and be restored to it again as appears in the forgetfulness men often have of their past actions and the mind many times recovers the memory of a past consciousness which it had lost for twenty years together make these intervals of memory and forgetfulness to take their turns regularly by day and night and you have two persons with the same immaterial spirit as much as in the former instance two persons with the same body so that self is not determined by identity or diversity of substance which it cannot be sure of but only by identity of consciousness not the substance with which the consciousness may be united indeed it may conceive the substance whereof it is now made up to have existed formerly united in the same conscious being but consciousness removed that substance is no more itself or makes no more a part of it than any other substance as is evident in the instance we have already given of a limb cut off of whose heat or cold or other affections having no longer any consciousness it is no more of a mans self than any other matter of the universe in like manner it will be in reference to any immaterial substance which is void of that consciousness whereby i am myself to myself if there be any part of its existence which i cannot upon recollection join with that present consciousness whereby i am now myself it is in that part of its existence no more myself than any other immaterial being for whatsoever any substance has thought or done which i cannot recollect and by my consciousness make my own thought and action it will no more belong to me whether a part of me thought or did it than if it had been thought or done by any other immaterial being anywhere existing consciousness unites substances material or spiritual with the same personality i agree the more probable opinion is that this consciousness is annexed to and the affection of one individual immaterial substance but let men according to their diverse hypotheses resolve of that as they please this every intelligent being sensible of happiness or misery must grantthat there is something that is himself that he is concerned for and would have happy that this self has existed in a continued duration more than one instant and therefore it is possible may exist as it has done months and years to come without any certain bounds to be set to its duration and may be the same self by the same consciousness continued on for the future and thus by this consciousness he finds himself to be the same self which did such and such an action some years since by which he comes to be happy or miserable now in all which account of self the same numerical substance is not considered as making the same self but the same continued consciousness in which several substances may have been united and again separated from it which whilst they continued in a vital union with that wherein this consciousness then resided made a part of that same self thus any part of our bodies vitally united to that which is conscious in us makes a part of ourselves but upon separation from the vital union by which that consciousness is communicated that which a moment since was part of ourselves is now no more so than a part of another mans self is a part of me and it is not impossible but in a little time may become a real part of another person and so we have the same numerical substance become a part of two different persons and the same person preserved under the change of various substances could we suppose any spirit wholly stripped of all its memory or consciousness of past actions as we find our minds always are of a great part of ours and sometimes of them all the union or separation of such a spiritual substance would make no variation of personal identity any more than that of any particle of matter does any substance vitally united to the present thinking being is a part of that very same self which now is anything united to it by a conscious ness of former actions makes also a part of the same self which is the same both then and now person a forensic term person as i take it is the name for this self wherever a man finds what he calls himself there i think another may say is the same person it is a forensic term appropriating actions and their merit and so belongs only to intelligent agents capable of a law and happiness and misery this personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past only by consciousnesswhereby it becomes concerned and accountable owns and imputes to itself past actions just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the present all which is founded in a concern for happiness the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness that which is conscious of pleasure and pain desiring that that self that is conscious should be happy and therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness it can be no more concerned in than if they had never been done and to receive pleasure or pain ie reward or punishment on the account of any such action is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being without any demerit at all for supposing a man punished now for what he had done in another life whereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all what difference is there between that punishment and being created miserable and therefore conformable to this the apostle tells us that at the great day when every one shall receive according to his doings the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open the sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all persons shall have that they themselves in what bodies soever they appear or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to are the same that committed those actions and deserve that punishment for them suppositions that look strange are pardonable in our ignorance i am apt enough to think i have in treating of this subject made some suppositions that will look strange to some readers and possibly they are so in themselves but yet i think they are such as are pardonable in this ignorance we are in of the nature of that thinking thing that is in us and which we look on as ourselves did we know what it was or how it was tied to a certain system of fleeting animal spirits or whether it could or could not perform its operations of thinking and memory out of a body organized as ours is and whether it has pleased god that no one such spirit shall ever be united to any but one such body upon the right constitution of whose organs its memory should depend we might see the absurdity of some of those suppositions i have made but taking as we ordinarily now do in the dark concerning these matters the soul of a man for an immaterial substance independent from matter and indifferent alike to it all there can from the nature of things be no absurdity at all to suppose that the same soul may at different times be united to different bodies and with them make up for that time one man as well as we suppose a part of a sheeps body yesterday should be a part of a mans body tomorrow and in that union make a vital part of meliboeus himself as well as it did of his ram the difficulty from ill use of names to conclude whatever substance begins to exist it must during its existence necessarily be the same whatever compositions of substances begin to exist during the union of those substances the concrete must be the same whatsoever mode begins to exist during its existence it is the same and so if the composition be of distinct substances and different modes the same rule holds whereby it will appear that the difficulty or obscurity that has been about this matter rather rises from the names illused than from any obscurity in things themselves for whatever makes the specific idea to which the name is applied if that idea be steadily kept to the distinction of anything into the same and divers will easily be conceived and there can arise no doubt about it continuance of that which we have made to he our complex idea of man makes the same man for supposing a rational spirit be the idea of a man it is easy to know what is the same man viz the same spirit whether separate or in a bodywill be the same man supposing a rational spirit vitally united to a body of a certain conformation of parts to make a man whilst that rational spirit with that vital conformation of parts though continued in a fleeting successive body remains it will be the same man but if to any one the idea of a man be but the vital union of parts in a certain shape as long as that vital union and shape remain in a concrete no otherwise the same but by a continued succession of fleeting particles it will be the same man for whatever be the composition whereof the complex idea is made whenever existence makes it one particular thing under any denomination the same existence continued preserves it the same individual under the same denomination of other relations ideas of proportional relations besides the beforementioned occasions of time place and causality of comparing or referring things one to another there are as i have said infinite others some whereof i shall mention first the first i shall name is some one simple idea which being capable of parts or degrees affords an occasion of comparing the subjects wherein it is to one another in respect of that simple idea vg whiter sweeter equal more c these relations depending on the equality and excess of the same simple idea in several subjects may be called if one will proportional and that these are only conversant about those simple ideas received from sensation or reflection is so evident that nothing need be said to evince it natural relation secondly another occasion of comparing things together or considering one thing so as to include in that consideration some other thing is the circumstances of their origin or beginning which being not afterwards to be altered make the relations depending thereon as lasting as the subjects to which they belong vg father and son brothers cousingermans c which have their relations by one community of blood wherein they partake in several degrees countrymen ie those who were born in the same country or tract of ground and these i call natural relations wherein we may observe that mankind have fitted their notions and words to the use of common life and not to the truth and extent of things for it is certain that in reality the relation is the same betwixt the begetter and the begotten in the several races of other animals as well as men but yet it is seldom said this bull is the grandfather of such a calf or that two pigeons are cousingermans it is very convenient that by distinct names these relations should be observed and marked out in mankind there being occasion both in laws and other communications one with another to mention and take notice of men under these relations from whence also arise the obligations of several duties amongst men whereas in brutes men having very little or no cause to mind these relations they have not thought fit to give them distinct and peculiar names this by the way may give us some light into the different state and growth of languages which being suited only to the convenience of communication are proportioned to the notions men have and the commerce of thoughts familiar amongst them and not to the reality or extent of things nor to the various respects might be found among them nor the different abstract considerations might be framed about them where they had no philosophical notions there they had no terms to express them and it is no wonder men should have framed no names for those things they found no occasion to discourse of from whence it is easy to imagine why as in some countries they may have not so much as the name for a horse and in others where they are more careful of the pedigrees of their horses than of their own that there they may have not only names for particular horses but also of their several relations of kindred one to another ideas of instituted or voluntary relations thirdly sometimes the foundation of considering things with reference to one another is some act whereby any one comes by a moral right power or obligation to do something thus a general is one that hath power to command an army and an army under a general is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man a citizen or a burgher is one who has a right to certain privileges in this or that place all this sort depending upon mens wills or agreement in society i call instituted or voluntary and may be distinguished from the natural in that they are most if not all of them some way or other alterable and separable from the persons to whom they have sometimes belonged though neither of the substances so related be destroyed now though these are all reciprocal as well as the rest and contain in them a reference of two things one to the other yet because one of the two things often wants a relative name importing that reference men usually take no notice of it and the relation is commonly overlooked vg a patron and client ire easily allowed to be relations but a constable or dictator are not so readily at first hearing considered as such because there is no peculiar name for those who are under the command of a dictator or constable expressing a relation to either of them though it be certain that either of them hath a certain power over some others and so is so far related to them as well as a patron is to his client or general to his army ideas of moral relations fourthly there is another sort of relation which is the conformity or disagreement mens voluntary actions have to a rule to which they are referred and by which they are judged of which i think may be called moral relation as being that which denominates our moral actions and deserves well to be examined there being no part of knowledge wherein we should be more careful to get determined ideas and avoid as much as may be obscurity and confusion human actions when with their various ends objects manners and circumstances they are framed into distinct complex ideas are as has been shown so many mixed modes a great part whereof have names annexed to them thus supposing gratitude to be a readiness to acknowledge and return kindness received polygamy to be the having more wives than one at once when we frame these notions thus in our minds we have there so many determined ideas of mixed modes but this is not all that concerns our actions it is not enough to have determined ideas of them and to know what names belong to such and such combinations of ideas we have a further and greater concernment and that is to know whether such actions so made up are morally good or bad moral good and evil good and evil as hath been shown bk ii chap xx ss and chap xxi ss are nothing but pleasure or pain or that which occasions or procures pleasure or pain to us moral good and evil then is only the conformity or disagreement of our voluntary actions to some law whereby good or evil is drawn on us from the will and power of the lawmaker which good and evil pleasure or pain attending our observance or breach of the law by the decree of the lawmaker is that we call reward and punishment moral rules of these moral rules or laws to which men generally refer and by which they judge of the rectitude or pravity of their actions there seem to me to be three sorts with their three different enforcements or rewards and punishments for since it would be utterly in vain to suppose a rule set to the free actions of men without annexing to it some enforcement of good and evil to determine his will we must wherever we suppose a law suppose also some reward or punishment annexed to that law it would be in vain for one intelligent being to set a rule to the actions of another if he had it not in his power to reward the compliance with and punish deviation from his rule by some good and evil that is not the natural product and consequence of the action itself for that being a natural convenience or inconvenience would operate of itself without a law this if i mistake not is the true nature of all law properly so called laws the laws that men generally refer their actions to to judge of their rectitude or obliquity seem to me to be these three the divine law the civil law the law of opinion or reputation if i may so call it by the relation they bear to the first of these men judge whether their actions are sins or duties by the second whether they be criminal or innocent and by the third whether they be virtues or vices divine law the measure of sin and duty first the divine law whereby that law which god has set to the actions of menwhether promulgated to them by the light of nature or the voice of revelation that god has given a rule whereby men should govern themselves i think there is nobody so brutish as to deny he has a right to do it we are his creatures he has goodness and wisdom to direct our actions to that which is best and he has power to enforce it by rewards and punishments of infinite weight and duration in another life for nobody can take us out of his hands this is the only true touchstone of moral rectitude and by comparing them to this law it is that men judge of the most considerable moral good or evil of their actions that is whether as duties or sins they are like to procure them happiness or misery from the hands of the almighty civil law the measure of crimes and innocence secondly the civil lawthe rule set by the commonwealth to the actions of those who belong to itis another rule to which men refer their actions to judge whether they be criminal or no this law nobody overlooks the rewards and punishments that enforce it being ready at hand and suitable to the power that makes it which is the force of the commonwealth engaged to protect the lives liberties and possessions of those who live according to its laws and has power to take away life liberty or goods from him who disobeys which is the punishment of offences committed against his law philosophical law the measure of virtue and vice thirdly the law of opinion or reputation virtue and vice are names pretended and supposed everywhere to stand for actions in their own nature right and wrong and as far as they really are so applied they so far are coincident with the divine law above mentioned but yet whatever is pretended this is visible that these names virtue and vice in the particular instances of their application through the several nations and societies of men in the world are constantly attributed only to such actions as in each country and society are in reputation or discredit nor is it to be thought strange that men everywhere should give the name of virtue to those actions which amongst them are judged praiseworthy and call that vice which they account blamable since otherwise they would condemn themselves if they should think anything right to which they allowed not commendation anything wrong which they let pass without blame thus the measure of what is everywhere called and esteemed virtue and vice is this approbation or dislike praise or blame which by a secret and tacit consent establishes itself in the several societies tribes and clubs of men in the world whereby several actions come to find credit or disgrace amongst them according to the judgment maxims or fashion of that place for though men uniting into politic societies have resigned up to the public the disposing of all their force so that they cannot employ it against any fellowcitizens any further than the law of the country directs yet they retain still the power of thinking well or ill approving or disapproving of the actions of those whom they live amongst and converse with and by this approbation and dislike they establish amongst themselves what they will call virtue and vice the measure that men commonly apply to determine what they call virtue and vice that this is the common measure of virtue and vice will appear to any one who considers that though that passes for vice in one country which is counted a virtue or at least not vice in another yet everywhere virtue and praise vice and blame go together virtue is everywhere that which is thought praiseworthy and nothing else but that which has the allowance of public esteem is called virtue virtue and praise are so united that they are called often by the same name sunt sua praemia laudi says virgil and so cicero nihil habet natura praestantius quam honestatem quam laudem quam dignitatem quam decus which he tells you are all names for the same thing this is the language of the heathen philosophers who well understood wherein their notions of virtue and vice consisted and though perhaps by the different temper education fashion maxims or interest of different sorts of men it fell out that what was thought praiseworthy in one place escaped not censure in another and so in different societies virtues and vices were changed yet as to the main they for the most part kept the same everywhere for since nothing can be more natural than to encourage with esteem and reputation that wherein every one finds his advantage and to blame and discountenance the contrary it is no wonder that esteem and discredit virtue and vice should in a great measure everywhere correspond with the un changeable rule of right and wrong which the law of god hath established there being nothing that so directly and visibly secures and advances the general good of mankind in this world as obedience to the laws he has set them and nothing that breeds such mischiefs and confusion as the neglect of them and therefore men without renouncing all sense and reason and their own interest which they are so constantly true to could not generally mistake in placing their commendation and blame on that side that really deserved it not nay even those men whose practice was otherwise failed not to give their approbation right few being depraved to that degree as not to condemn at least in others the faults they themselves were guilty of whereby even in the corruption of manners the true boundaries of the law of nature which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice were pretty well preferred so that even the exhortations of inspired teachers have not feared to appeal to common repute whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise c phil its enforcement is commendation and discredit if any one shall imagine that i have forgot my own notion of a law when i make the law whereby men judge of virtue and vice to be nothing else but the consent of private men who have not authority enough to make a law especially wanting that which is so necessary and essential to a law a power to enforce it i think i may say that he who imagines commendation and disgrace not to be strong motives to men to accommodate themselves to the opinions and rules of those with whom they converse seems little skilled in the nature or history of mankind the greatest part whereof we shall find to govern themselves chiefly if not solely by this law of fashion and so they do that which keeps them in reputation with their company little regard the laws of god or the magistrate the penalties that attend the breach of gods laws some nay perhaps most men seldom seriously reflect on and amongst those that do many whilst they break the law entertain thoughts of future reconciliation and making their peace for such breaches and as to the punishments due from the laws of the com monwealth they frequently flatter themselves with the hopes of impunity but no man escapes the punishment of their censure and dislike who offends against the fashion and opinion of the company he keeps and would recommend himself to nor is there one of ten thousand who is stiff and insensible enough to bear up under the constant dislike and condemnation of his own club he must be of a strange and unusual constitution who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society solitude many men have sought and been reconciled to but nobody that has the least thought or sense of a man about him can live in society under the constant dislike and ill opinion of his familiars and those he converses with this is a burden too heavy for human sufferance and he must be made up of irreconcilable contradictions who can take pleasure in company and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace from his companions these three laws the rules of moral good and evil these three then first the law of god secondly the law of politic societies thirdly the law of fashion or private censure are those to which men variously compare their actions and it is by their conformity to one of these laws that they take their measures when they would judge of their moral rectitude and denominate their actions good or bad morality is the relation of voluntary actions to these rules whether the rule to which as to a touchstone we bring our voluntary actions to examine them by and try their goodness and accordingly to name them which is as it were the mark of the value we set upon them whether i say we take that rule from the fashion of the country or the will of a lawmaker the mind is easily able to observe the relation any action hath to it and to judge whether the action agrees or disagrees with the rule and so hath a notion of moral goodness or evil which is either conformity or not conformity of any action to that rule and therefore is often called moral rectitude this rule being nothing but a collection of several simple ideas the conformity thereto is but so ordering the action that the simple ideas belonging to it may correspond to those which the law requires and thus we see how moral beings and notions are founded on and terminated in these simple ideas we have received from sensation or reflection for example let us consider the complex idea we signify by the word murder and when we have taken it asunder and examined all the particulars we shall find them to amount to a collection of simple ideas derived from reflection or sensation viz first from reflection on the operations of our own minds we have the ideas of willing considering purposing beforehand malice or wishing ill to another and also of life or perception and selfmotion secondly from sensation we have the collection of those simple sensible ideas which are to be found in a man and of some action whereby we put an end to perception and motion in the man all which simple ideas are comprehended in the word murder this collection of simple ideas being found by me to agree or disagree with the esteem of the country i have been bred in and to be held by most men there worthy praise or blame i call the action virtuous or vicious if i have the will of a supreme invisible lawgiver for my rule then as i supposed the action commanded or forbidden by god i call it good or evil sin or duty and if i compare it to the civil law the rule made by the legislative power of the country i call it lawful or unlawful a crime or no crime so that whencesoever we take the rule of moral actions or by what standard soever we frame in our minds the ideas of virtues or vices they consist only and are made up of collections of simple ideas which we originally received from sense or reflection and their rectitude or obliquity consists in the agreement or disagreement with those patterns prescribed by some law moral actions may be regarded either absolutely or as ideas of relation to conceive rightly of moral actions we must take notice of them under this twofold consideration first as they are in themselves each made up of such a collection of simple ideas thus drunkenness or lying signify such or such a collection of simple ideas which i call mixed modes and in this sense they are as much positive absolute ideas as the drinking of a horse or speaking of a parrot secondly our actions are considered as good bad or indifferent and in this respect they are relative it being their conformity to or disagreement with some rule that makes them to be regular or irregular good or bad and so as far as they are compared with a rule and thereupon denominated they come under relation thus the challenging and fighting with a man as it is a certain positive mode or particular sort of action by particular ideas distinguished from all others is called duelling which when considered in relation to the law of god will deserve the name of sin to the law of fashion in some countries valour and virtue and to the municipal laws of some governments a capital crime in this case when the positive mode has one name and another name as it stands in relation to the law the distinction may as easily be observed as it is in substances where one name vg man is used to signify the thing another vg father to signify the relation the denominations of actions often mislead us but because very frequently the positive idea of the action and its moral relation are comprehended together under one name and the game word made use of to express both the mode or action and its moral rectitude or obliquity therefore the relation itself is less taken notice of and there is often no distinction made between the positive idea of the action and the reference it has to a rule by which confusion of these two distinct considerations under one term those who yield too easily to the impressions of sounds and are forward to take names for things are often misled in their judgment of actions thus the taking from another what is his without his knowledge or allowance is properly called stealing but that name being commonly understood to signify also the moral pravity of the action and to denote its contrariety to the law men are apt to condemn whatever they hear called stealing as an ill action disagreeing with the rule of right and yet the private taking away his sword from a madman to prevent his doing mischief though it be properly denominated stealing as the name of such a mixed mode yet when compared to the law of god and considered in its relation to that supreme rule it is no sin or transgression though the name stealing ordinarily carries such an intimation with it relations innumerable and only the most considerable here mentioned and thus much for the relation of human actions to a law which therefore i call moral relations it would make a volume to go over all sorts of relations it is not therefore to be expected that i should here mention them all it suffices to our present purpose to show by these what the ideas are we have of this comprehensive consideration called relation which is so various and the occasions of it so many as many as there can be of comparing things one to another that it is not very easy to reduce it to rules or under just heads those i have mentioned i think are some of the most considerable and such as may serve to let us see from whence we get our ideas of relations and wherein they are founded but before i quit this argument from what has been said give me leave to observe all relations terminate in simple ideas first that it is evident that all relation terminates in and is ultimately founded on those simple ideas we have got from sensation or reflection so that all we have in our thoughts ourselves if we think of anything or have any meaning or would signify to others when we use words standing for relations is nothing but some simple ideas or collections of simple ideas compared one with another this is so manifest in that sort called proportional that nothing can be more for when a man says honey is sweeter than wax it is plain that his thoughts in this relation terminate in this simple idea sweetness which is equally true of all the rest though where they are compounded or decompounded the simple ideas they are made up of are perhaps seldom taken notice of vg when the word father is mentioned first there is meant that particular species or collective idea signified by the word man secondly those sensible simple ideas signified by the word generation and thirdly the effects of it and all the simple ideas signified by the word child so the word friend being taken for a man who loves and is ready to do good to another has all these following ideas to the making of it up first all the simple ideas comprehended in the word man or intelligent being secondly the idea of love thirdly the idea of readiness or disposition fourthly the idea of action which is any kind of thought or motion fifthly the idea of good which signifies anything that may advance his happiness and terminates at last if examined in particular simple ideas of which the word good in general signifies any one but if removed from all simple ideas quite it signifies nothing at all and thus also all moral words terminate at last though perhaps more remotely in a collection of simple ideas the immediate signification of relative words being very often other supposed known relations which if traced one to another still end in simple ideas we have ordinarily as clear a notion of the relation as of the simple ideas in things on which it is founded secondly that in relations we have for the most part if not always as clear a notion of the relation as we have of those simple ideas wherein it is founded agreement or disagreement whereon relation depends being things whereof we have commonly as clear ideas as of any other whatsoever it being but the distinguishing simple ideas or their degrees one from another without which we could have no distinct knowledge at all for if i have a clear idea of sweetness light or extension i have too of equal or more or less of each of these if i know what it is for one man to be born of a woman viz sempronia i know what it is for another man to be born of the same woman sempronia and so have as clear a notion of brothers as of births and perhaps clearer for if i believed that sempronia digged titus out of the parsleybed as they used to tell children and thereby became his mother and that afterwards in the same manner she digged caius out of the parsleybed i had as clear a notion of the relation of brothers between them as if i had all the skill of a midwife the notion that the same woman contributed as mother equally to their births though i were ignorant or mistaken in the manner of it being that on which i grounded the relation and that they agreed in that circumstance of birth let it be what it will the comparing them then in their descent from the same person without knowing the particular circumstances of that descent is enough to found my notion of their having or not having the relation of brothers but though the ideas of particular relations are capable of being as clear and distinct in the minds of those who will duly consider them as those of mixed modes and more determinate than those of substances yet the names belonging to relation are often of as doubtful and uncertain signification as those of substances or mixed modes and much more than those of simple ideas because relative words being the marks of this comparison which is made only by mens thoughts and is an idea only in mens minds men frequently apply them to different comparisons of things according to their own imaginations which do not always correspond with those of others using the same name the notion of relation is the same whether the rule any action is compared to be true or false thirdly that in these i call moral relations i have a true notion of relation by comparing the action with the rule whether the rule be true or false for if i measure anything by a yard i know whether the thing i measure be longer or shorter than that supposed yard though perhaps the yard i measure by be not exactly the standard which indeed is another inquiry for though the rule be erroneous and i mistaken in it yet the agreement or disagreement observable in that which i compare with makes me perceive the relation though measuring by a wrong rule i shall thereby be brought to judge amiss of its moral rectitude because i have tried it by that which is not the true rule yet i am not mistaken in the relation which that action bears to that rule i compare it to which is agreement or disagreement of clear and obscure distinct and confused ideas ideas some clear and distinct others obscure and confused having shown the original of our ideas and taken a view of their several sorts considered the difference between the simple and the complex and observed how the complex ones are divided into those of modes substances and relationsall which i think is necessary to be done by any one who would acquaint himself thoroughly with the progress of the mind in its apprehension and knowledge of thingsit will perhaps be thought i have dwelt long enough upon the examination of ideas i must nevertheless crave leave to offer some few other considerations concerning them the first is that some are clear and others obscure some distinct and others confused clear and obscure explained by sight the perception of the mind being most aptly explained by words relating to the sight we shall best understand what is meant by clear and obscure in our ideas by reflecting on what we call clear and obscure in the objects of sight light being that which discovers to us visible objects we give the name of obscure to that which is not placed in a light sufficient to discover minutely to us the figure and colours which are observable in it and which in a better light would be discernible in like manner our simple ideas are clear when they are such as the objects themselves from whence they were taken did or might in a wellordered sensation or perception present them whilst the memory retains them thus and can produce them to the mind whenever it has occasion to consider them they are clear ideas so far as they either want anything of the original exactness or have lost any of their first freshness and are as it were faded or tarnished by time so far are they obscure complex ideas as they are made up of simple ones so they are clear when the ideas that go to their composition are clear and the number and order of those simple ideas that are the ingredients of any complex one is determinate and certain causes of obscurity the causes of obscurity in simple ideas seem to be either dull organs or very slight and transient impressions made by the objects or else a weakness in the memory not able to retain them as received for to return again to visible objects to help us to apprehend this matter if the organs or faculties of perception like wax overhardened with cold will not receive the impression of the seal from the usual impulse wont to imprint it or like wax of a temper too soft will not hold it well when well imprinted or else supposing the wax of a temper fit but the seal not applied with a sufficient force to make a clear impression in any of these cases the print left by the seal will be obscure this i suppose needs no application to make it plainer distinct and confused what as a clear idea is that whereof the mind has such a full and evident perception as it does receive from an outward object operating duly on a welldisposed organ so a distinct idea is that wherein the mind perceives a difference from all other and a confused idea is such an one as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it ought to be different objection if no idea be confused but such as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it should be different it will be hard may any one say to find anywhere a confused idea for let any idea be as it will it can be no other but such as the mind perceives it to be and that very perception sufficiently distinguishes it from all other ideas which cannot be other ie different without being perceived to be so no idea therefore can be undistinguishable from another from which it ought to be different unless you would have it different from itself for from all other it is evidently different confusion of ideas is in reference to their names to remove this difficulty and to help us to conceive aright what it is that makes the confusion ideas are at any time chargeable with we must consider that things ranked under distinct names are supposed different enough to be distinguished that so each sort by its peculiar name may be marked and discoursed of apart upon any occasion and there is nothing more evident than that the greatest part of different names are supposed to stand for different things now every idea a man has being visibly what it is and distinct from all other ideas but itself that which makes it confused is when it is such that it may as well be called by another name as that which it is expressed by the difference which keeps the things to be ranked under those two different names distinct and makes some of them belong rather to the one and some of them to the other of those names being left out and so the distinction which was intended to be kept up by those different names is quite lost defaults which make this confusion the defaults which usually occasion this confusion i think are chiefly these following complex ideas made up of too few simple ones first when any complex idea for it is complex ideas that are most liable to confusion is made up of too small a number of simple ideas and such only as are common to other things whereby the differences that make it deserve a different name are left out thus he that has an idea made up of barely the simple ones of a beast with spots has but a confused idea of a leopard it not being thereby sufficiently distinguished from a lynx and several other sorts of beasts that are spotted so that such an idea though it hath the peculiar name leopard is not distinguishable from those designed by the names lynx or panther and may as well come under the name lynx as leopard how much the custom of defining of words by general terms contributes to make the ideas we would express by them confused and undetermined i leave others to consider this is evident that confused ideas are such as render the use of words uncertain and take away the benefit of distinct names when the ideas for which we use different terms have not a difference answerable to their distinct names and so cannot be distinguished by them there it is that they are truly confused their simple ones jumbled disorderly together secondly another fault which makes our ideas confused is when though the particulars that make up any idea are in number enough yet they are so jumbled together that it is not easily discernible whether it more belongs to the name that is given it than to any other there is nothing properer to make us conceive this confusion than a sort of pictures usually shown as surprising pieces of art wherein the colours as they are laid by the pencil on the table itself mark out very odd and unusual figures and have no discernible order in their position this draught thus made up of parts wherein no symmetry nor order appears is in itself no more a confused thing than the picture of a cloudy sky wherein though there be as little order of colours or figures to be found yet nobody thinks it a confused picture what is it then that makes it be thought confused since the want of symmetry does not as it is plain it does not for another draught made barely in imitation of this could not be called confused i answer that which makes it be thought confused is the applying it to some name to which it does no more discernibly belong than to some other vg when it is said to be the picture of a man or caesar then any one with reason counts it confused because it is not discernible in that state to belong more to the name man or caesar than to the name baboon or pompey which are supposed to stand for different ideas from those signified by man or caesar but when a cylindrical mirror placed right had reduced those irregular lines on the table into their due order and proportion then the confusion ceases and the eye presently sees that it is a man or caesar ie that it belongs to those names and that it is sufficiently distinguishable from a baboon or pompey ie from the ideas signified by those names just thus it is with our ideas which are as it were the pictures of things no one of these mental draughts however the parts are put together can be called confused for they are plainly discernible as they are till it be ranked under some ordinary name to which it cannot be discerned to belong any more than it does to some other name of an allowed different signification their simple ones mutable and undetermined thirdly a third defect that frequently gives the name of confused to our ideas is when any one of them is uncertain and undetermined thus we may observe men who not forbearing to use the ordinary words of their language till they have learned their precise signification change the idea they make this or that term stand for almost as often as they use it he that does this out of uncertainty of what he should leave out or put into his idea of church or idolatry every time he thinks of either and holds not steady to any one precise combination of ideas that makes it up is said to have a confused idea of idolatry or the church though this be still for the same reason as the former viz because a mutable idea if we will allow it to be one idea cannot belong to one name rather than another and so loses the distinction that distinct names are designed for confusion without reference to names hardly conceivable by what has been said we may observe how much names as supposed steady signs of things and by their difference to stand for and keep things distinct that in themselves are different are the occasion of denominating ideas distinct or confused by a secret and unobserved reference the mind makes of its ideas to such names this perhaps will be fuller understood after what i say of words in the third book has been read and considered but without taking notice of such a reference of ideas to distinct names as the signs of distinct things it will be hard to say what a confused idea is and therefore when a man designs by any name a sort of things or any one particular thing distinct from all others the complex idea he annexes to that name is the more distinct the more particular the ideas are and the greater and more determinate the number and order of them is whereof it is made up for the more it has of these the more it has still of the perceivable differences whereby it is kept separate and distinct from all ideas belonging to other names even those that approach nearest to it and thereby all confusion with them is avoided confusion concerns always two ideas confusion making it a difficulty to separate two things that should be separated concerns always two ideas and those most which most approach one another whenever therefore we suspect any idea to be confused we must examine what other it is in danger to be confounded with or which it cannot easily be separated from and that will always be found an idea belonging to another name and so should be a different thing from which yet it is not sufficiently distinct being either the same with it or making a part of it or at least as properly called by that name as the other it is ranked under and so keeps not that difference from that other idea which the different names import causes of confused ideas this i think is the confusion proper to ideas which still carries with it a secret reference to names at least if there be any other confusion of ideas this is that which most of all disorders mens thoughts and discourses ideas as ranked under names being those that for the most part men reason of within themselves and always those which they commune about with others and therefore where there are supposed two different ideas marked by two different names which are not as distinguishable as the sounds that stand for them there never fails to be confusion and where any ideas are distinct as the ideas of those two sounds they are marked by there can be between them no confusion the way to prevent it is to collect and unite into one complex idea as precisely as is possible all those ingredients whereby it is differenced from others and to them so united in a determinate number and order apply steadily the same name but this neither accommodating mens ease or vanity nor serving any design but that of naked truth which is not always the thing aimed at such exactness is rather to be wished than hoped for and since the loose application of names to undetermined variable and almost no ideas serves both to cover our own ignorance as well as to perplex and confound others which goes for learning and superiority in knowledge it is no wonder that most men should use it themselves whilst they complain of it in others though i think no small part of the confusion to be found in the notions of men might by care and ingenuity be avoided yet i am far from concluding it everywhere wilful some ideas are so complex and made up of so many parts that the memory does not easily retain the very same precise combination of simple ideas under one name much less are we able constantly to divine for what precise complex idea such a name stands in another mans use of it from the first of these follows confusion in a mans own reasonings and opinions within himself from the latter frequent confusion in discoursing and arguing with others but having more at large treated of words their defects and abuses in the following book i shall here say no more of it complex ideas may be distinct in one part and confused in another our complex ideas being made up of collections and so variety of simple ones may ac cordingly be very clear and distinct in one part and very obscure and confused in another in a man who speaks of a chiliaedron or a body of a thousand sides the ideas of the figure may be very confused though that of the number be very distinct so that he being able to discourse and demonstrate concerning that part of his complex idea which depends upon the number of thousand he is apt to think he has a distinct idea of a chiliaedron though it be plain he has no precise idea of its figure so as to distinguish it by that from one that has but sides the not observing whereof causes no small error in mens thoughts and confusion in their discourses this if not heeded causes confusion in our arguings he that thinks he has a distinct idea of the figure of a chiliaedron let him for trial sake take another parcel of the same uniform matter viz gold or wax of an equal bulk and make it into a figure of sides he will i doubt not be able to distinguish these two ideas one from another by the number of sides and reason and argue distinctly about them whilst he keeps his thoughts and reasoning to that part only of these ideas which is contained in their numbers as that the sides of the one could be divided into two equal numbers and of the others not c but when he goes about to distinguish them by their figure he will there be presently at a loss and not be able i think to frame in his mind two ideas one of them distinct from the other by the bare figure of these two pieces of gold as he could if the same parcels of gold were made one into a cube the other a figure of five sides in which incomplete ideas we are very apt to impose on ourselves and wrangle with others especially where they have particular and familiar names for being satisfied in that part of the idea which we have clear and the name which is familiar to us being applied to the whole containing that part also which is imperfect and obscure we are apt to use it for that confused part and draw deductions from it in the obscure part of its signification as confidently as we do from the other instance in eternity having frequently in our mouths the name eternity we are apt to think we have a positive comprehensive idea of it which is as much as to say that there is no part of that duration which is not clearly contained in our idea it is true that he that thinks so may have a clear idea of duration he may also have a clear idea of a very great length of duration he may also have a clear idea of the comparison of that great one with still a greater but it not being possible for him to include in his idea of any duration let it be as great as it will the whole extent together of a duration where he supposes no end that part of his idea which is still beyond the bounds of that large duration he represents to his own thoughts is very obscure and un determined and hence it is that in disputes and reasonings concerning eternity or any other infinite we are very apt to blunder and involve ourselves in manifest absurdities infinite divisibility of matter in matter we have no clear ideas of the smallness of parts much beyond the smallest that occur to any of our senses and therefore when we talk of the divisibility of matter in infinitum though we have clear ideas of division and divisibility and have also clear ideas of parts made out of a whole by division yet we have but very obscure and confused ideas of corpuscles or minute bodies so to be divided when by former divisions they are reduced to a smallness much exceeding the perception of any of our senses and so all that we have clear and distinct ideas of is of what division in general or abstractedly is and the relation of totum and pars but of the bulk of the body to be thus infinitely divided after certain progressions i think we have no clear nor distinct idea at all for i ask any one whether taking the smallest atom of dust he ever saw he has any distinct idea bating still the number which concerns not extension betwixt the th and the th part of it or if he think he can refine his ideas to that degree without losing sight of them let him add ten cyphers to each of those numbers such a degree of smallness is not unreasonable to be supposed since a division carried on so far brings it no nearer the end of infinite division than the first division into two halves does i must confess for my part i have no clear distinct ideas of the differ ent bulk or extension of those bodies having but a very obscure one of either of them so that i think when we talk of division of bodies in infinitum our idea of their distinct bulks which is the subject and foundation of division comes after a little progression to be confounded and almost lost in obscurity for that idea which is to represent only bigness must be very obscure and confused which we cannot distinguish from one ten times as big but only by number so that we have clear distinct ideas we may say of ten and one but no distinct ideas of two such extensions it is plain from hence that when we talk of infinite divisibility of body or extension our distinct and clear ideas are only of numbers but the clear distinct ideas of extension after some progress of division are quite lost and of such minute parts we have no distinct ideas at all but it returns as all our ideas of infinite do at last to that of number always to be added but thereby never amounts to any distinct idea of actual infinite parts we have it is true a clear idea of division as often as we think of it but thereby we have no more a clear idea of infinite parts in matter than we have a clear idea of an infinite number by being able still to add new numbers to any assigned numbers we have endless divisibility giving us no more a clear and distinct idea of actually infinite parts than endless addibility if i may so speak gives us a clear and distinct idea of an actually infinite number they both being only in a power still of increasing the number be it already as great as it will so that of what remains to be added wherein consists the infinity we have but an obscure imperfect and confused idea from or about which we can argue or reason with no certainty or clearness no more than we can in arithmetic about a number of which we have no such distinct idea as we have of or but only this relative obscure one that compared to any other it is still bigger and we have no more a clear positive idea of it when we say or conceive it is bigger or more than than if we should say it is bigger than or having no nearer a proportion to the end of addition or number than for he that adds only to and so proceeds shall as soon come to the end of all addition as he that adds to and so likewise in eternity he that has an idea of but four years has as much a positive complete idea of eternity as he that has one of of years for what remains of eternity beyond either of these two numbers of years is as clear to the one as the other ie neither of them has any clear positive idea of it at all for he that adds only years to and so on shall as soon reach eternity as he that adds of years and so on or if he please doubles the increase as often as he will the remaining abyss being still as far beyond the end of all these progressions as it is from the length of a day or an hour for nothing finite bears any proportion to infinite and therefore our ideas which are all finite cannot bear any thus it is also in our idea of extension when we increase it by addition as well as when we diminish it by division and would enlarge our thoughts to infinite space after a few doublings of those ideas of extension which are the largest we are accustomed to have we lose the clear distinct idea of that space it becomes a confusedly great one with a surplus of still greater about which when we would argue or reason we shall always find ourselves at a loss confused ideas in our arguings and deductions from that part of them which is confused always leading us into confusion of real and fantastical ideas ideas considered in reference to their archetypes besides what we have already mentioned concerning ideas other considerations belong to them in reference to things from whence they are taken or which they may be supposed to represent and thus i think they may come under a threefold distinction and are first either real or fantastical secondly adequate or inadequate thirdly true or false first by real ideas i mean such as have a foundation in nature such as have a conformity with the real being and existence of things or with their archetypes fantastical or chimerical i call such as have no founda tion in nature nor have any conformity with that reality of being to which they are tacitly referred as to their archetypes if we examine the several sorts of ideas before mentioned we shall find that simple ideas are all real appearances of things first our simple ideas are all real all agree to the reality of things not that they are all of them the images or representations of what does exist the contrary whereof in all but the primary qualities of bodies hath been already shown but though whiteness and coldness are no more in snow than pain is yet those ideas of whiteness and coldness pain c being in us the effects of powers in things without us ordained by our maker to produce in us such sensations they are real ideas in us whereby we distinguish the qualities that are really in things themselves for these several appearances being designed to be the mark whereby we are to know and distinguish things which we have to do with our ideas do as well serve us to that purpose and are as real distinguishing characters whether they be only constant effects or else exact resemblances of something in the things themselves the reality lying in that steady correspondence they have with the distinct constitutions of real beings but whether they answer to those constitutions as to causes or patterns it matters not it suffices that they are constantly produced by them and thus our simple ideas are all real and true because they answer and agree to those powers of things which produce them in our minds that being all that is requisite to make them real and not fictions at pleasure for in simple ideas as has been shown the mind is wholly confined to the operation of things upon it and can make to itself no simple idea more than what it has received complex ideas are voluntary combinations though the mind be wholly passive in respect of its simple ideas yet i think we may say it is not so in respect of its complex ideas for those being combinations of simple ideas put together and united under one general name it is plain that the mind of man uses some kind of liberty in forming those complex ideas how else comes it to pass that one mans idea of gold or justice is differ ent from anothers but because he has put in or left out of his some simple idea which the other has not the question then is which of these are real and which barely imaginary combinations what collections agree to the reality of things and what not and to this i say that mixed modes and relations made of consistent ideas are real secondly mixed modes and relations having no other reality but what they have in the minds of men there is nothing more required to this kind of ideas to make them real but that they be so framed that there be a possibility of existing conformable to them these ideas themselves being archetypes cannot differ from their archetypes and so cannot be chimerical unless any one will jumble together in them inconsistent ideas indeed as any of them have the names of a known language assigned to them by which he that has them in his mind would signify them to others so bare possibility of existing is not enough they must have a conformity to the ordinary signification of the name that is given them that they may not be thought fantastical as if a man would give the name of justice to that idea which common use calls liberality but this fantasticalness relates more to propriety of speech than reality of ideas for a man to be undisturbed in danger sedately to consider what is fittest to be done and to execute it steadily is a mixed mode or a complex idea of an action which may exist but to be undisturbed in danger without using ones reason or industry is what is also possible to be and so is as real an idea as the other though the first of these having the name courage given to it may in respect of that name be a right or wrong idea but the other whilst it has not a common received name of any known language assigned to it is not capable of any deformity being made with no reference to anything but itself complex ideas of substances are real when they agree with the existence of things thirdly our complex ideas of substances being made all of them in reference to things existing without us and intended to be representations of substances as they really are are no further real than as they are such combinations of simple ideas as are really united and coexist in things without us on the contrary those are fantastical which are made up of such collections of simple ideas as were really never united never were found together in any substance vg a rational creature consisting of a horses head joined to a body of human shape or such as the centaurs are described or a body yellow very malleable fusible and fixed but lighter than common water or an uniform unorganized body consisting as to sense all of similar parts with perception and voluntary motion joined to it whether such substances as these can possibly exist or no it is probable we do not know but be that as it will these ideas of substances being made conformable to no pattern existing that we know and consisting of such collections of ideas as no substance ever showed us united together they ought to pass with us for barely imaginary but much more are those complex ideas so which contain in them any inconsistency or contradiction of their parts of adequate and inadequate ideas adequate ideas are such as perfectly represent their archetypes of our real ideas some are adequate and some are inadequate those i call adequate which perfectly represent those archetypes which the mind supposes them taken from which it intends them to stand for and to which it refers them inadequate ideas are such which are but a partial or incomplete representation of those archetypes to which they are referred upon which account it is plain simple ideas all adequate first that all our simple ideas are adequate because being nothing but the effects of certain powers in things fitted and ordained by god to produce such sensations in us they cannot but be correspondent and adequate to those powers and we are sure they agree to the reality of things for if sugar produce in us the ideas which we call whiteness and sweetness we are sure there is a power in sugar to produce those ideas in our minds or else they could not have been produced by it and so each sensation answering the power that operates on any of our senses the idea so produced is a real idea and not a fiction of the mind which has no power to produce any simple idea and cannot but be adequate since it ought only to answer that power and so all simple ideas are adequate it is true the things producing in us these simple ideas are but few of them denominated by us as if they were only the causes of them but as if those ideas were real beings in them for though fire be called painful to the touch whereby is signified the power of producing in us the idea of pain yet it is denominated also light and hot as if light and heat were really something in the fire more than a power to excite these ideas in us and therefore are called qualities in or of the fire but these being nothing in truth but powers to excite such ideas in us i must in that sense be understood when i speak of secondary qualities as being in things or of their ideas as being the objects that excite them in us such ways of speaking though accommodated to the vulgar notions without which one cannot be well understood yet truly signify nothing but those powers which are in things to excite certain sensations or ideas in us since were there no fit organs to receive the impressions fire makes on the sight and touch nor a mind joined to those organs to receive the ideas of light and heat by those impressions from the fire or sun there would yet be no more light or heat in the world than there would be pain if there were no sensible creature to feel it though the sun should continue just as it is now and mount aetna flame higher than ever it did solidity and extension and the termination of it figure with motion and rest whereof we have the ideas would be really in the world as they are whether there were any sensible being to perceive them or no and therefore we have reason to look on those as the real modifications of matter and such as are the exciting causes of all our various sensations from bodies but this being an inquiry not belonging to this place i shall enter no further into it but proceed to show what complex ideas are adequate and what not modes are all adequate secondly our complex ideas of modes being voluntary collections of simple ideas which the mind puts together without reference to any real archetypes or standing patterns existing anywhere are and cannot but be adequate ideas because they not being intended for copies of things really existing but for archetypes made by the mind to rank and denominate things by cannot want anything they having each of them that combination of ideas and thereby that perfection which the mind intended they should so that the mind acquiesces in them and can find nothing wanting thus by having the idea of a figure with three sides meeting at three angles i have a complete idea wherein i require nothing else to make it perfect that the mind is satisfied with the perfection of this its idea is plain in that it does not conceive that any understanding hath or can have a more complete or perfect idea of that thing it signifies by the word triangle supposing it to exist than itself has in that complex idea of three sides and three angles in which is contained all that is or can be essential to it or necessary to complete it wherever or however it exists but in our ideas of substances it is otherwise for there desiring to copy things as they really do exist and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties depend we perceive our ideas attain not that perfection we intend we find they still want something we should be glad were in them and so are all inadequate but mixed modes and relations being archetypes without patterns and so having nothing to represent but themselves cannot but be adequate everything being so to itself he that at first put together the idea of danger perceived absence of disorder from fear sedate consideration of what was justly to be done and executing that without disturbance or being deterred by the danger of it had certainly in his mind that complex idea made up of that combination and intending it to be nothing else but what is nor to have in it any other simple ideas but what it hath it could not also but be an adequate idea and laying this up in his memory with the name courage annexed to it to signify to others and denominate from thence any action he should observe to agree with it had thereby a standard to measure and denominate actions by as they agreed to it this idea thus made and laid up for a pattern must necessarily be adequate being referred to nothing else but itself nor made by any other original but the good liking and will of him that first made this combination modes in reference to settled names may be inadequate indeed another coming after and in conversation learning from him the word courage may make an idea to which he gives the name courage different from what the first author applied it to and has in his mind when he uses it and in this case if he designs that his idea in thinking should be conformable to the others idea as the name he uses in speaking is conformable in sound to his from whom he learned it his idea may be very wrong and inadequate because in this case making the other mans idea the pattern of his idea in thinking as the other mans word or sound is the pattern of his in speaking his idea is so far defective and inadequate as it is distant from the archetype and pattern he refers it to and intends to express and signify by the name he uses for it which name he would have to be a sign of the other mans idea to which in its proper use it is primarily annexed and of his own as agreeing to it to which if his own does not exactly correspond it is faulty and inadequate because then meant in propriety of speech to correspond to the ideas in some other mind therefore these complex ideas of modes which they are referred by the mind and intended to correspond to the ideas in the mind of some other intelligent being expressed by the names we apply to them they may be very deficient wrong and inadequate because they agree not to that which the mind designs to be their archetype and pattern in which respect only any idea of modes can be wrong imperfect or inadequate and on this account our ideas of mixed modes are the most liable to be faulty of any other but this refers more to proper speaking than knowing right ideas of substances as referred to real essences not adequate thirdly what ideas we have of substances i have above shown now those ideas have in the mind a double reference sometimes they are referred to a supposed real essence of each species of things sometimes they are only designed to be pictures and repre sentations in the mind of things that do exist by ideas of those qualities that are discoverable in them in both which ways these copies of those originals and archetypes are imperfect and inadequate first it is usual for men to make the names of substances stand for things as supposed to have certain real essences whereby they are of this or that species and names standing for nothing but the ideas that are in mens minds they must constantly refer their ideas to such real essences as to their archetypes that men especially such as have been bred up in the learning taught in this part of the world do suppose certain specific essences of substances which each individual in its several kinds is made conformable to and partakes of is so far from needing proof that it will be thought strange if any one should do otherwise and thus they ordinarily apply the specific names they rank particular substances under to things as distinguished by such specific real essences who is there almost who would not take it amiss if it should be doubted whether he called himself a man with any other meaning than as having the real essence of a man and yet if you demand what those real essences are it is plain men are ignorant and know them not from whence it follows that the ideas they have in their minds being referred to real essences as to archetypes which are unknown must be so far from being adequate that they cannot be supposed to be any representation of them at all the complex ideas we have of substances are as it has been shown certain collections of simple ideas that have been observed or supposed constantly to exist together but such a complex idea cannot be the real essence of any substance for then the properties we discover in that body would depend on that complex idea and be deducible from it and their necessary connexion with it be known as all properties of a triangle depend on and as far as they are discoverable are deducible from the complex idea of three lines including a space but it is plain that in our complex ideas of substances are not contained such ideas on which all the other qualities that are to be found in them do depend the common idea men have of iron is a body of a certain colour weight and hardness and a property that they look on as belonging to it is malleableness but yet this property has no necessary connexion with that complex idea or any part of it and there is no more reason to think that malleableness depends on that colour weight and hardness than that colour or that weight depends on its malleableness and yet though we know nothing of these real essences there is nothing more ordinary than that men should attribute the sorts of things to such essences the particular parcel of matter which makes the ring i have on my finger is forwardly by most men supposed to have a real essence whereby it is gold and from whence those qualities flow which i find in it viz its peculiar colour weight hardness fusibility fixedness and change of colour upon a slight touch of mercury c this essence from which all these properties flow when i inquire into it and search after it i plainly perceive i cannot discover the furthest i can go is only to presume that it being nothing but body its real essence or internal constitution on which these qualities depend can be nothing but the figure size and connexion of its solid parts of neither of which having any distinct perception at all can i have any idea of its essence which is the cause that it has that particular shining yellowness a greater weight than anything i know of the same bulk and a fitness to have its colour changed by the touch of quicksilver if any one will say that the real essence and internal constitution on which these properties depend is not the figure size and arrangement or connexion of its solid parts but something else called its particular form i am further from having any idea of its real essence than i was before for i have an idea of figure size and situation of solid parts in general though i have none of the particular figure size or putting together of parts whereby the qualities above mentioned are produced which qualities i find in that particular parcel of matter that is on my finger and not in another parcel of matter with which i cut the pen i write with but when i am told that something besides the figure size and posture of the solid parts of that body in its essence something called substantial form of that i confess i have no idea at all but only of the sound form which is far enough from an idea of its real essence or constitution the like ignorance as i have of the real essence of this particular substance i have also of the real essence of all other natural ones of which essences i confess i have no distinct ideas at all and i am apt to suppose others when they examine their own knowledge will find in themselves in this one point the same sort of ignorance because men know not the real essences of substances now then when men apply to this particular parcel of matter on my finger a general name already in use and denominate it gold do they not ordinarily or are they not understood to give it that name as belonging to a particular species of bodies having a real internal essence by having of which essence this particular substance comes to be of that species and to be called by that name if it be so as it is plain it is the name by which things are marked as having that essence must be referred primarily to that essence and consequently the idea to which that name is given must be referred also to that essence and be intended to represent it which essence since they who so use the names know not their ideas of substances must be all inadequate in that respect as not containing in them that real essence which the mind intends they should ideas of substances when regarded as collections of their qualities are all inadequate secondly those who neglecting that useless supposition of unknown real essences whereby they are distinguished endeavour to copy the substances that exist in the world by putting together the ideas of those sensible qualities which are found coexisting in them though they come much nearer a likeness of them than those who imagine they know not what real specific essences yet they arrive not at perfectly adequate ideas of those substances they would thus copy into the their minds nor do those copies exactly and fully contain all that is to be found in their archetypes because those qualities and powers of substances whereof we make their complex ideas are so many and various that no mans complex idea contains them all that our complex ideas of substances do not contain in them all the simple ideas that are united in the things themselves is evident in that men do rarely put into their complex idea of any substance all the simple ideas they do know to exist in it because endeavouring to make the signification of their names as clear and as little cumbersome as they can they make their specific ideas of the sorts of substance for the most part of a few of those simple ideas which are to be found in them but these having no original precedency or right to be put in and make the specific idea more than others that are left out it is plain that both these ways our ideas of substances are deficient and inadequate the simple ideas whereof we make our complex ones of substances are all of them bating only the figure and bulk of some sorts powers which being relations to other substances we can never be sure that we know all the powers that are in any one body till we have tried what changes it is fitted to give to or receive from other substances in their several ways of application which being impossible to be tried upon any one body much less upon all it is impossible we should have adequate ideas of any substance made up of a collection of all its properties their powers usually make up our complex ideas of substances whosoever first lighted on a parcel of that sort of substance we denote by the word gold could not rationally take the bulk and figure he observed in that lump to depend on its real essence or internal constitution therefore those never went into his idea of that species of body but its peculiar colour perhaps and weight were the first he abstracted from it to make the complex idea of that species which both are but powers the one to affect our eyes after such a manner and to produce in us that idea we call yellow and the other to force upwards any other body of equal bulk they being put into a pair of equal scales one against another another perhaps added to these the ideas of fusibility and fixedness two other passive powers in relation to the operation of fire upon it another its ductility and solubility in aqua regia two other powers relating to the operation of other bodies in changing its outward figure or separation of it into insensible parts these or parts of these put together usually make the complex idea in mens minds of that sort of body we call gold substances have innumerable powers not contained in our complex ideas of them but no one who hath considered the properties of bodies in general or this sort in particular can doubt that this called gold has infinite other properties not contained in that complex idea some who have examined this species more accurately could i believe enumerate ten times as many properties in gold all of them as inseparable from its internal constitution as its colour or weight and it is probable if any one knew all the properties that are by divers men known of this metal there would be an hundred times as many ideas go to the complex idea of gold as any one man yet has in his and yet perhaps that not be the thousandth part of what is to be discovered in it the changes that that one body is apt to receive and make in other bodies upon a due application exceeding far not only what we know but what we are apt to imagine which will not appear so much a paradox to any one who will but consider how far men are yet from knowing all the properties of that one no very compound figure a triangle though it be no small number that are already by mathematicians discovered of it ideas of substances being got only by collecting their qualities are all inadequate so that all our complex ideas of substances are imperfect and inadequate which would be so also in mathematical figures if we were to have our complex ideas of them only by collecting their properties in reference to other figures how uncertain and imperfect would our ideas be of an ellipsis if we had no other idea of it but some few of its properties whereas having in our plain idea the whole essence of that figure we from thence discover those properties and demonstratively see how they flow and are inseparable from it simple ideas ektupa and adequate thus the mind has three sorts of abstract ideas or nominal essences first simple ideas which are ektupa or copies but yet certainly adequate because being intended to express nothing but the power in things to produce in the mind such a sensation that sensation when it is produced cannot but be the effect of that power so the paper i write on having the power in the light i speak according to the common notion of light to produce in men the sensation which i call white it cannot but be the effect of such a power in something without the mind since the mind has not the power to produce any such idea in itself and being meant for nothing else but the effect of such a power that simple idea is real and adequate the sensation of white in my mind being the effect of that power which is in the paper to produce it is perfectly adequate to that power or else that power would produce a different idea ideas of substances are ektupa and inadequate secondly the complex ideas of substances are ectypes copies too but not perfect ones not adequate which is very evident to the mind in that it plainly perceives that whatever collection of simple ideas it makes of any substance that exists it cannot be sure that it exactly answers all that are in that substance since not having tried all the operations of all other substances upon it and found all the alterations it would receive from or cause in other substances it cannot have an exact adequate collection of all its active and passive capacities and so not have an adequate complex idea of the powers of any substance existing and its relations which is that sort of complex idea of substances we have and after all if we would have and actually had in our complex idea an exact collection of all the secondary qualities or powers of any substance we should not yet thereby have an idea of the essence of that thing for since the powers or qualities that are observable by us are not the real essence of that substance but depend on it and flow from it any collection whatsoever of these qualities cannot be the real essence of that thing whereby it is plain that our ideas of substances are not adequate are not what the mind intends them to be besides a man has no idea of substance in general nor knows what substance is in itself ideas of modes and relations are archetypes and cannot be adequate thirdly complex ideas of modes and relations are originals and archetypes are not copies nor made after the pattern of any real existence to which the mind intends them to be conformable and exactly to answer these being such collections of simple ideas that the mind itself puts together and such collections that each of them contains in it precisely all that the mind intends that it should they are archetypes and essences of modes that may exist and so are designed only for and belong only to such modes as when they do exist have an exact conformity with those complex ideas the ideas therefore of modes and relations cannot but be adequate of true and false ideas truth and falsehood properly belong to propositions not to ideas though truth and falsehood belong in propriety of speech only to propositions yet ideas are oftentimes termed true or false as what words are there that are not used with great latitude and with some deviation from their strict and proper significations though i think that when ideas themselves are termed true or false there is still some secret or tacit proposition which is the foundation of that denomination as we shall see if we examine the particular occasions wherein they come to be called true or false in all which we shall find some kind of affirmation or negation which is the reason of that denomination for our ideas being nothing but bare appearances or perceptions in our minds cannot properly and simply in themselves be said to be true or false no more than a single name of anything can be said to be true or false ideas and words may be said to be true inasmuch as they really are ideas and words indeed both ideas and words may be said to be true in a metaphysical sense of the word truth as all other things that any way exist are said to be true ie really to be such as they exist though in things called true even in that sense there is perhaps a secret reference to our ideas looked upon as the standards of that truth which amounts to a mental proposition though it be usually not taken notice of no idea as an appearance in the mind either true or false but it is not in that metaphysical sense of truth which we inquire here when we examine whether our ideas are capable of being true or false but in the more ordinary acceptation of those words and so i say that the ideas in our minds being only so many perceptions or appearances there none of them are false the idea of a centaur having no more falsehood in it when it appears in our minds than the name centaur has falsehood in it when it is pronounced by our mouths or written on paper for truth or falsehood lying always in some affirmation or negation mental or verbal our ideas are not capable any of them of being false till the mind passes some judgment on them that is affirms or denies something of them ideas referred to anything extraneous to them may be true or false whenever the mind refers any of its ideas to anything extraneous to them they are then capable to be called true or false because the mind in such a reference makes a tacit supposition of their conformity to that thing which supposition as it happens to be true or false so the ideas themselves come to be denominated the most usual cases wherein this happens are these following other mens ideas real existence and supposed real essences are what men usually refer their ideas to first when the mind supposes any idea it has conformable to that in other mens minds called by the same common name vg when the mind intends or judges its ideas of justice temperance religion to be the same with what other men give those names to secondly when the mind supposes any idea it has in itself to be conformable to some real existence thus the two ideas of a man and a centaur supposed to be the ideas of real substances are the one true and the other false the one having a conformity to what has really existed the other not thirdly when the mind refers any of its ideas to that real constitution and essence of anything whereon all its properties depend and thus the greatest part if not all our ideas of substances are false the cause of such reference these suppositions the mind is very apt tacitly to make concerning its own ideas but yet if we will examine it we shall find it is chiefly if not only concerning its abstract complex ideas for the natural tendency of the mind being towards knowledge and finding that if it should proceed by and dwell upon only particular things its progress would be very slow and its work endless therefore to shorten its way to knowledge and make each perception more comprehensive the first thing it does as the foundation of the easier enlarging its knowledge either by contemplation of the things themselves that it would know or conference with others about them is to bind them into bundles and rank them so into sorts that what knowledge it gets of any of them it may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort and so advance by larger steps in that which is its great business knowledge this as i have elsewhere shown is the reason why we collect things under comprehensive ideas with names annexed to them into genera and species ie into kinds and sorts names of things supposed to carry in them knowledge of their essences if therefore we will warily attend to the motions of the mind and observe what course it usually takes in its way to knowledge we shall i think find that the mind having got an idea which it thinks it may have use of either in contemplation or discourse the first thing it does is to abstract it and then get a name to it and so lay it up in its storehouse the memory as containing the essence of a sort of things of which that name is always to be the mark hence it is that we may often observe that when any one sees a new thing of a kind that he knows not he presently asks what it is meaning by that inquiry nothing but the name as if the name carried with it the knowledge of the species or the essence of it whereof it is indeed used as the mark and is generally supposed annexed to it how men suppose that their ideas must correspond to things and to the customary meanings of names but this abstract idea being something in the mind between the thing that exists and the name that is given to it it is in our ideas that both the rightness of our knowledge and the propriety and intelligibleness of our speaking consists and hence it is that men are so forward to suppose that the abstract ideas they have in their minds are such as agree to the things existing without them to which they are referred and are the same also to which the names they give them do by the use and propriety of that language belong for without this double conformity of their ideas they find they should both think amiss of things in themselves and talk of them unintelligibly to others simple ideas may be false in reference to others of the same name but are least liable to be so first then i say that when the truth of our ideas is judged of by the conformity they have to the ideas which other men have and commonly signify by the same name they may be any of them false but yet simple ideas are least of all liable to be so mistaken because a man by his senses and every days observation may easily satisfy himself what the simple ideas are which their several names that are in common use stand for they being but few in number and such as if he doubts or mistakes in he may easily rectify by the objects they are to be found in therefore it is seldom that any one mistakes in his names of simple ideas or applies the name red to the idea green or the name sweet to the idea bitter mush less are men apt to confound the names of ideas belonging to different senses and call a colour by the name of a taste c whereby it is evident that the simple ideas they call by any name are commonly the same that others have and mean when they use the same names ideas of mixed modes most liable to be false in this sense complex ideas are much more liable to be false in this respect and the complex ideas of mixed modes much more than those of substances because in substances especially those which the common and unborrowed names of any language are applied to some remarkable sensible qualities serving ordinarily to distinguish one sort from another easily preserve those who take any care in the use of their words from applying them to sorts of substances to which they do not at all belong but in mixed modes we are much more uncertain it being not so easy to determine of several actions whether they are to be called justice or cruelly liberality or prodigality and so in referring our ideas to those of other men called by the same names ours may be false and the idea in our minds which we express by the word justice may perhaps be that which ought to have another name or at least to be thought false but whether or no our ideas of mixed modes are more liable than any sort to be different from those of other men which are marked by the same names this at least is certain that this sort of falsehood is much more familiarly attributed to our ideas of mixed modes than to any other when a man is thought to have a false idea of justice or gratitude or glory it is for no other reason but that his agrees not with the ideas which each of those names are the signs of in other men and why the reason whereof seems to me to be this that the abstract ideas of mixed modes being mens voluntary combinations of such a precise collection of simple ideas and so the essence of each species being made by men alone whereof we have no other sensible standard existing anywhere but the name itself or the definition of that name we having nothing else to refer these our ideas of mixed modes to as a standard to which we would conform them but the ideas of those who are thought to use those names in their most proper significations and so as our ideas conform or differ from them they pass for true or false and thus much concerning the truth and falsehood of our ideas in reference to their names as referred to real existence none of our ideas can be false but those of substances secondly as to the truth and falsehood of our ideas in reference to the real existence of things when that is made the standard of their truth none of them can be termed false but only our complex ideas of substances simple ideas in this sense not false and why first our simple ideas being barely such perceptions as god has fitted us to receive and given power to external objects to produce in us by established laws and ways suitable to his wisdom and goodness though incomprehensible to us their truth consists in nothing else but in such appearances as are produced in us and must be suitable to those powers he has placed in external objects or else they could not be produced in us and thus answering those powers they are what they should be true ideas nor do they become liable to any imputation of falsehood if the mind as in most men i believe it does judges these ideas to be in the things themselves for god in his wisdom having set them as marks of distinction in things whereby we may be able to discern one thing from another and so choose any of them for our uses as we have occasion it alters not the nature of our simple idea whether we think that the idea of blue be in the violet itself or in our mind only and only the power of producing it by the texture of its parts reflecting the particles of light after a certain manner to be in the violet itself for that texture in the object by a regular and constant operation producing the same idea of blue in us it serves us to distinguish by our eyes that from any other thing whether that distinguishing mark as it is really in the violet be only a peculiar texture of parts or else that very colour the idea whereof which is in us is the exact resemblance and it is equally from that appearance to be denominated blue whether it be that real colour or only a peculiar texture in it that causes in us that idea since the name blue notes properly nothing but that mark of distinction that is in a violet discernible only by our eyes whatever it consists in that being beyond our capacities distinctly to know and perhaps would be of less use to us if we had faculties to discern though one mans idea of blue should be different from anothers neither would it carry any imputation of falsehood to our simple ideas if by the different structure of our organs it were so ordered that the same object should produce in several mens minds different ideas at the same time vg if the idea that a violet produced in one mans mind by his eyes were the same that a marigold produced in another mans and vice versa for since this could never be known because one mans mind could not pass into another mans body to perceive what appearances were produced by those organs neither the ideas hereby nor the names would be at all confounded or any falsehood be in either for all things that had the texture of a violet producing constantly the idea that he called blue and those which had the texture of a marigold producing constantly the idea which he as constantly called yellow whatever those appearances were in his mind he would be able as regu larly to distinguish things for his use by those appearances and understand and signify those distinctions marked by the name blue and yellow as if the appearances or ideas in his mind received from those two flowers were exactly the same with the ideas in other mens minds i am nevertheless very apt to think that the sensible ideas produced by any object in different mens minds are most commonly very near and undiscernibly alike for which opinion i think there might be many reasons offered but that being besides my present business i shall not trouble my reader with them but only mind him that the contrary supposition if it could be proved is of little use either for the improvement of our knowledge or conveniency of life and so we need not trouble ourselves to examine it simple ideas can none of them be false in respect of real existence from what has been said concerning our simple ideas i think it evident that our simple ideas can none of them be false in respect of things existing without us for the truth of these appearances or perceptions in our minds consisting as has been said only in their being answerable to the powers in external objects to produce by our senses such appearances in us and each of them being in the mind such as it is suitable to the power that produced it and which alone it represents it cannot upon that account or as referred to such a pattern be false blue and yellow bitter or sweet can never be false ideas these perceptions in the mind are just such as they are there answering the powers appointed by god to produce them and so are truly what they are and are intended to be indeed the names may be misapplied but that in this respect makes no falsehood in the ideas as if a man ignorant in the english tongue should call purple scarlet modes not false cannot be false in reference to essences of things secondly neither can our complex ideas of modes in reference to the essence of anything really existing be false because whatever complex ideas i have of any mode it hath no reference to any pattern existing and made by nature it is not supposed to contain in it any other ideas than what it hath nor to represent anything but such a complication of ideas as it does thus when i have the idea of such an action of a man who forbears to afford himself such meat drink and clothing and other conveniences of life as his riches and estate will be sufficient to supply and his station requires i have no false idea but such an one as represents an action either as i find or imagine it and so is capable of neither truth nor falsehood but when i give the name frugality or virtue to this action then it may be called a false idea if thereby it be supposed to agree with that idea to which in propriety of speech the name of frugality doth belong or to be conformable to that law which is the standard of virtue and vice ideas of substances may be false in reference to existing things thirdly our complex ideas of substances being all referred to patterns in things themselves may be false that they are all false when looked upon as the representations of the unknown essences of things is so evident that there needs nothing to be said of it i shall therefore pass over that chimerical supposition and consider them as collections of simple ideas in the mind taken from combinations of simple ideas existing together constantly in things of which patterns they are the supposed copies and in this reference of them to the existence of things they are false ideas when they put together simple ideas which in the real existence of things have no union as when to the shape and size that exist together in a horse is joined in the same complex idea the power of barking like a dog which three ideas however put together into one in the mind were never united in nature and this therefore may be called a false idea of a horse ideas of substances are in this respect also false when from any collection of simple ideas that do always exist together there is separated by a direct negation any other simple idea which is constantly joined with them thus if to extension solidity fusibility the peculiar weightiness and yellow colour of gold any one join in his thoughts the negation of a greater degree of fixedness than is in lead or copper he may be said to have a false complex idea as well as when he joins to those other simple ones the idea of perfect absolute fixedness for either way the complex idea of gold being made up of such simple ones as have no union in nature may be termed false but if he leave out of this his complex idea that of fixedness quite without either actually joining to or separating it from the rest in his mind it is i think to be looked on as an inadequate and imperfect idea rather than a false one since though it contains not all the simple ideas that are united in nature yet it puts none together but what do really exist together truth or falsehood always supposes affirmation or negation though in compliance with the ordinary way of speaking i have shown in what sense and upon what ground our ideas may be sometimes called true or false yet if we will look a little nearer into the matter in all cases where any idea is called true or false it is from some judgment that the mind makes or is supposed to make that is true or false for truth or falsehood being never without some affirmation or negation express or tacit it is not to be found but where signs are joined or separated according to the agreement or disagreement of the things they stand for the signs we chiefly use are either ideas or words wherewith we make either mental or verbal propositions truth lies in so joining or separating these representatives as the things they stand for do in themselves agree or disagree and falsehood in the contrary as shall be more fully shown hereafter ideas in themselves neither true nor false any idea then which we have in our minds whether conformable or not to the existence of things or to any idea in the minds of other men cannot properly for this alone be called false for these representations if they have nothing in them but what is really existing in things without cannot be thought false being exact representations of something nor yet if they have anything in them differing from the reality of things can they properly be said to be false representations or ideas of things they do not represent but the mistake and falsehood is but are falsewhen judged agreeable to another mans idea without being so first when the mind having any idea it judges and concludes it the same that is in other mens minds signified by the same name or that it is conformable to the ordinary received signification or definition of that word when indeed it is not which is the most usual mistake in mixed modes though other ideas also are liable to it when judged to agree to real existence when they do not when it having a complex idea made up of such a collection of simple ones as nature never puts together it judges it to agree to a species of creatures really existing as when it joins the weight of tin to the colour fusibility and fixedness of gold when judged adequate without being so when in its complex idea it has united a certain number of simple ideas that do really exist together in some sort of creatures but has also left out others as much inseparable it judges this to be a perfect complete idea of a sort of things which really it is not vg having joined the ideas of substance yellow malleable most heavy and fusible it takes that complex idea to be the complete idea of gold when yet its peculiar fixedness and solubility in aqua regia are as inseparable from those other ideas or qualities of that body as they are one from another when judged to represent the real essence the mistake is yet greater when i judge that this complex idea contains in it the real essence of any body existing when at least it contains but some few of those properties which flow from its real essence and constitution i say only some few of those properties for those properties consisting mostly in the active and passive powers it has in reference to other things all that are vulgarly known of any one body of which the complex idea of that kind of things is usually made are but a very few in comparison of what a man that has several ways tried and examined it knows of that one sort of things and all that the most expert man knows are but a few in comparison of what are really in that body and depend on its internal or essential constitution the essence of a triangle lies in a very little compass consists in a very few ideas three lines including a space make up that essence but the properties that flow from this essence are more than can be easily known or enumerated so i imagine it is in substances their real essences lie in a little compass though the properties flowing from that internal constitution are endless ideas when called false to conclude a man having no notion of anything without him but by the idea he has of it in his mind which idea he has a power to call by what name he pleases he may indeed make an idea neither answering the reason of things nor agreeing to the idea commonly signified by other peoples words but cannot make a wrong or false idea of a thing which is no otherwise known to him but by the idea he has of it vg when i frame an idea of the legs arms and body of a man and join to this a horses head and neck i do not make a false idea of anything because it represents nothing without me but when i call it a man or tartar and imagine it to represent some real being without me or to be the same idea that others call by the same name in either of these cases i may err and upon this account it is that it comes to be termed a false idea though indeed the falsehood lies not in the idea but in that tacit mental proposition wherein a conformity and resemblance is attributed to it which it has not but yet if having framed such an idea in my mind without thinking either that existence or the name man or tartar belongs to it i will call it man or tartar i may be justly thought fantastical in the naming but not erroneous in my judgment nor the idea any way false more properly to be called right or wrong upon the whole matter i think that our ideas as they are considered by the mindeither in reference to the proper signification of their names or in reference to the reality of thingsmay very fitly be called right or wrong ideas according as they agree or disagree to those patterns to which they are referred but if any one had rather call them true or false it is fit he use a liberty which every one has to call things by those names he thinks best though in propriety of speech truth or falsehood will i think scarce agree to them but as they some way or other virtually contain in them some mental proposition the ideas that are in a mans mind simply considered cannot be wrong unless complex ones wherein inconsistent parts are jumbled together all other ideas are in themselves right and the knowledge about them right and true knowledge but when we come to refer them to anything as to their patterns and arche types then they are capable of being wrong as far as they disagree with such archetypes of the association of ideas something unreasonable in most men there is scarce any one that does not observe something that seems odd to him and is in itself really extravagant in the opinions reasonings and actions of other men the least flaw of this kind if at all different from his own every one is quicksighted enough to espy in another and will by the authority of reason forwardly condemn though he be guilty of much greater unreasonableness in his own tenets and conduct which he never perceives and will very hardly if at all be convinced of not wholly from selflove this proceeds not wholly from selflove though that has often a great hand in it men of fair minds and not given up to the overweening of selfflattery are frequently guilty of it and in many cases one with amazement hears the arguings and is astonished at the obstinacy of a worthy man who yields not to the evidence of reason though laid before him as clear as daylight not from education this sort of unreasonableness is usually imputed to education and prejudice and for the most part truly enough though that reaches not the bottom of the disease nor shows distinctly enough whence it rises or wherein it lies education is often rightly assigned for the cause and prejudice is a good general name for the thing itself but yet i think he ought to look a little further who would trace this sort of madness to the root it springs from and so explain it as to show whence this flaw has its original in very sober and rational minds and wherein it consists a degree of madness found in most men i shall be pardoned for calling it by so harsh a name as madness when it is considered that opposition to reason deserves that name and is really madness and there is scarce a man so free from it but that if he should always on all occasions argue or do as in some cases he constantly does would not be thought fitter for bedlam than civil conversation i do not here mean when he is under the power of an unruly passion but in the steady calm course of his life that which will yet more apologize for this harsh name and ungrateful imputation on the greatest part of mankind is that inquiring a little by the bye into the nature of madness bk ii ch xi ss i found it to spring from the very same root and to depend on the very same cause we are here speaking of this consideration of the thing itself at a time when i thought not the least on the subject which i am now treating of suggested it to me and if this be a weakness to which all men are so liable if this be a taint which so universally infects mankind the greater care should be taken to lay it open under its due name thereby to excite the greater care in its prevention and cure from a wrong connexion of ideas some of our ideas have a natural correspondence and connexion one with another it is the office and excellency of our reason to trace these and hold them together in that union and correspondence which is founded in their peculiar beings besides this there is another connexion of ideas wholly owing to chance or custom ideas that in themselves are not all of kin come to be so united in some mens minds that it is very hard to separate them they always keep in company and the one no sooner at any time comes into the understanding but its associate appears with it and if they are more than two which are thus united the whole gang always inseparable show themselves together this connexion made by custom this strong combination of ideas not allied by nature the mind makes in itself either voluntarily or by chance and hence it comes in different men to be very different according to their different inclinations education interests c custom settles habits of thinking in the understanding as well as of determining in the will and of motions in the body all which seems to be but trains of motions in the animal spirits which once set a going continue in the same steps they have used to which by often treading are worn into a smooth path and the motion in it becomes easy and as it were natural as far as we can comprehend thinking thus ideas seem to be produced in our minds or if they are not this may serve to explain their following one another in an habitual train when once they are put into their track as well as it does to explain such motions of the body a musician used to any tune will find that let it but once begin in his head the ideas of the several notes of it will follow one another orderly in his understanding without any care or attention as regularly as his fingers move orderly over the keys of the organ to play out the tune he has begun though his unattentive thoughts be elsewhere a wandering whether the natural cause of these ideas as well as of that regular dancing of his fingers be the motion of his animal spirits i will not determine how probable soever by this instance it appears to be so but this may help us a little to conceive of intellectual habits and of the tying together of ideas some antipathies an effect of it that there are such associations of them made by custom in the minds of most men i think nobody will question who has well considered himself or others and to this perhaps might be justly attributed most of the sympathies and antipathies observable in men which work as strongly and produce as regular effects as if they were natural and are therefore called so though they at first had no other original but the accidental connexion of two ideas which either the strength of the first impression or future indulgence so united that they always afterwards kept company together in that mans mind as if they were but one idea i say most of the antipathies i do not say all for some of them are truly natural depend upon our original constitution and are born with us but a great part of those which are counted natural would have been known to be from unheeded though perhaps early impressions or wanton fancies at first which would have been acknowledged the original of them if they had been warily observed a grown person surfeiting with honey no sooner hears the name of it but his fancy immediately carries sickness and qualms to his stomach and he cannot bear the very idea of it other ideas of dislike and sickness and vomiting presently accompany it and he is disturbed but he knows from whence to date this weakness and can tell how he got this indisposition had this happened to him by an overdose of honey when a child all the same effects would have followed but the cause would have been mistaken and the antipathy counted natural influence of association to be watched educating young children i mention this not out of any great necessity there is in this present argument to distinguish nicely between natural and acquired antipathies but i take notice of it for another purpose viz that those who have children or the charge of their education would think it worth their while diligently to watch and carefully to prevent the undue connexion of ideas in the minds of young people this is the time most susceptible of lasting impressions and though those relating to the health of the body are by discreet people minded and fenced against yet i am apt to doubt that those which relate more peculiarly to the mind and terminate in the understanding or passions have been much less heeded than the thing deserves nay those relating purely to the understanding have as i suspect been by most men wholly overlooked wrong connexion of ideas a great cause of errors this wrong connexion in our minds of ideas in themselves loose and independent of one another has such an influence and is of so great force to set us awry in our actions as well moral as natural passions reasonings and notions themselves that perhaps there is not any one thing that deserves more to be looked after an instance the ideas of goblins and sprites have really no more to do with darkness than light yet let but a foolish maid inculcate these often on the mind of a child and raise them there together possibly he shall never be able to separate them again so long as he lives but darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas and they shall be so joined that he can no more bear the one than the other another instance a man receives a sensible injury from another thinks on the man and that action over and over and by ruminating on them strongly or much in his mind so cements those two ideas together that he makes them almost one never thinks on the man but the pain and displeasure he suffered comes into his mind with it so that he scarce distinguishes them but has as much an aversion for the one as the other thus hatreds are often begotten from slight and innocent occasions and quarrels propagated and continued in the world a third instance a man has suffered pain or sickness in any place he saw his friend die in such a room though these have in nature nothing to do one with another yet when the idea of the place occurs to his mind it brings the impression being once made that of the pain and displeasure with it he confounds them in his mind and can as little bear the one as the other why time cures some disorders in the mind which reason cannot cure when this combination is settled and while it lasts it is not in the power of reason to help us and relieve us from the effects of it ideas in our minds when they are there will operate according to their natures and circumstances and here we see the cause why time cures certain affections which reason though in the right and allowed to be so has not power over nor is able against them to prevail with those who are apt to hearken to it in other cases the death of a child that was the daily delight of its mothers eyes and joy of her soul rends from her heart the whole comfort of her life and gives her all the torment imaginable use the consolations of reason in this case and you were as good preach ease to one on the rack and hope to allay by rational discourses the pain of his joints tearing asunder till time has by disuse separated the sense of that enjoyment and its loss from the idea of the child returning to her memory all representations though ever so reasonable are in vain and therefore some in whom the union between these ideas is never dissolved spend their lives in mourning and carry an incurable sorrow to their graves another instance of the effect of the association of ideas a friend of mine knew one perfectly cured of madness by a very harsh and offensive operation the gentleman who was thus recovered with great sense of gratitude and acknowledgment owned the cure all his life after as the greatest obligation he could have received but whatever gratitude and reason suggested to him he could never bear the sight of the operator that image brought back with it the idea of that agony which he suffered from his hands which was too mighty and intolerable for him to endure more instances many children imputing the pain they endured at school to their books they were corrected for so join those ideas together that a book becomes their aversion and they are never reconciled to the study and use of them all their lives after and thus reading becomes a torment to them which otherwise possibly they might have made the great pleasure of their lives there are rooms convenient enough that some men cannot study in and fashions of vessels which though ever so clean and commodious they cannot drink out of and that by reason of some accidental ideas which are annexed to them and make them offensive and who is there that hath not observed some man to flag at the appearance or in the company of some certain person not otherwise superior to him but because having once on some occasion got the ascendant the idea of authority and distance goes along with that of the person and he that has been thus subjected is not able to separate them a curious instance instances of this kind are so plentiful everywhere that if i add one more it is only for the pleasant oddness of it it is of a young gentleman who having learnt to dance and that to great perfection there happened to stand an old trunk in the room where he learnt the idea of this remarkable piece of household stuff had so mixed itself with the turns and steps of all his dances that though in that chamber he could dance excellently well yet it was only whilst that trunk was there nor could he perform well in any other place unless that or some such other trunk had its due position in the room if this story shall be suspected to be dressed up with some comical circumstances a little beyond precise nature i answer for myself that i had it some years since from a very sober and worthy man upon his own knowledge as i report it and i dare say there are very few inquisitive persons who read this who have not met with accounts if not examples of this nature that may parallel or at least justify this influence of association on intellectual habits intellectual habits and defects this way contracted are not less frequent and powerful though less observed let the ideas of being and matter be strongly joined either by education or much thought whilst these are still combined in the mind what notions what reasonings will there be about separate spirits let custom from the very childhood have joined figure and shape to the idea of god and what absurdities will that mind be liable to about the deity let the idea of infallibility be inseparably joined to any person and these two constantly together possess the mind and then one body in two places at once shall unexamined be swallowed for a certain truth by an implicit faith whenever that imagined infallible person dictates and demands assent without inquiry observable in the opposition between different sects of philosophy and of religion some such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found to establish the irreconcilable opposition between different sects of philosophy and religion for we cannot imagine every one of their followers to impose wilfully on himself and knowingly refuse truth offered by plain reason interest though it does a great deal in the case yet cannot be thought to work whole societies of men to so universal a perverseness as that every one of them to a man should knowingly maintain falsehood some at least must be allowed to do what all pretend to ie to pursue truth sincerely and therefore there must be something that blinds their understandings and makes them not see the falsehood of what they embrace for real truth that which thus captivates their reasons and leads men of sincerity blindfold from common sense will when examined be found to be what we are speaking of some independent ideas of no alliance to one another are by education custom and the constant din of their party so coupled in their minds that they always appear there together and they can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they were but one idea and they operate as if they were so this gives sense to jargon demonstration to absurdities and consistency to nonsense and is the foundation of the greatest i had almost said of all the errors in the world or if it does not reach so far it is at least the most dangerous one since so far as it obtains it hinders men from seeing and examining when two things in themselves disjoined appear to the sight constantly united if the eye sees these things riveted which are loose where will you begin to rectify the mistakes that follow in two ideas that they have been accustomed so to join in their minds as to substitute one for the other and as i am apt to think often without perceiving it themselves this whilst they are under the deceit of it makes them incapable of conviction and they applaud themselves as zealous champions for truth when indeed they are contending for error and the confusion of two different ideas which a customary connexion of them in their minds hath to them made in effect but one fills their heads with false views and their reasonings with false consequences conclusion having thus given an account of the original sorts and extent of our ideas with several other considerations about these i know not whether i may say instruments or materials of our knowledge the method i at first proposed to myself would now require that i should immediately proceed to show what use the understanding makes of them and what knowledge we have by them this was that which in the first general view i had of this subject was all that i thought i should have to do but upon a nearer approach i find that there is so close a connexion between ideas and words and our abstract ideas and general words have so constant a relation one to another that it is impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge which all consists in propositions without considering first the nature use and signification of language which therefore must be the business of the next book of words of words or language in general man fitted to form articulate sounds god having designed man for a sociable creature made him not only with an inclination and under a necessity to have fellowship with those of his own kind but furnished him also with language which was to be the great instrument and common tie of society man therefore had by nature his organs so fashioned as to be fit to frame articulate sounds which we call words but this was not enough to produce language for parrots and several other birds will be taught to make articulate sounds distinct enough which yet by no means are capable of language to use these sounds as signs of ideas besides articulate sounds therefore it was further necessary that he should be able to use these sounds as signs of internal conceptions and to make them stand as marks for the ideas within his own mind whereby they might be made known to others and the thoughts of mens minds be conveyed from one to another to make them general signs but neither was this sufficient to make words so useful as they ought to be it is not enough for the perfection of language that sounds can be made signs of ideas unless those signs can be so made use of as to comprehend several particular things for the multiplication of words would have perplexed their use had every particular thing need of a distinct name to be signified by to remedy this inconvenience language had yet a further improvement in the use of general terms whereby one word was made to mark a multitude of particular existences which advantageous use of sounds was obtained only by the difference of the ideas they were made signs of those names becoming general which are made to stand for general ideas and those remaining particular where the ideas they are used for are particular to make them signify the absence of positive ideas besides these names which stand for ideas there be other words which men make use of not to signify any idea but the want or absence of some ideas simple or complex or all ideas together such as are nihil in latin and in english ignorance and barrenness all which negative or privative words cannot be said properly to belong to or signify no ideas for then they would be perfectly insignificant sounds but they relate to positive ideas and signify their absence words ultimately derived from such as signify sensible ideas it may also lead us a little towards the original of all our notions and knowledge if we remark how great a dependence our words have on common sensible ideas and how those which are made use of to stand for actions and notions quite removed from sense have their rise from thence and from obvious sensible ideas are transferred to more abstruse significations and made to stand for ideas that come not under the cognizance of our senses vg to imagine apprehend comprehend adhere conceive instil disgust disturbance tranquillity c are all words taken from the operations of sensible things and applied to certain modes of thinking spirit in its primary signification is breath angel a messenger and i doubt not but if we could trace them to their sources we should find in all languages the names which stand for things that fall not under our senses to have had their first rise from sensible ideas by which we may give some kind of guess what kind of notions they were and whence derived which filled their minds who were the first beginners of languages and how nature even in the naming of things unawares suggested to men the originals and principles of all their knowledge whilst to give names that might make known to others any operations they felt in themselves or any other ideas that came not under their senses they were fain to borrow words from ordinary known ideas of sensation by that means to make others the more easily to conceive those operations they experimented in themselves which made no outward sensible appearances and then when they had got known and agreed names to signify those internal operations of their own minds they were sufficiently furnished to make known by words all their other ideas since they could consist of nothing but either of outward sensible perceptions or of the inward operations of their minds about them we having as has been proved no ideas at all but what originally come either from sensible objects without or what we feel within ourselves from the inward workings of our own spirits of which we are conscious to ourselves within distribution of subjects to be treated of but to understand better the use and force of language as subservient to instruction and knowledge it will be convenient to consider first to what it is that names in the use of language are immediately applied secondly since all except proper names are general and so stand not particularly for this or that single thing but for sorts and ranks of things it will be necessary to consider in the next place what the sorts and kinds or if you rather like the latin names what the species and genera of things are wherein they consist and how they come to be made these being as they ought well looked into we shall the better come to find the right use of words the natural advantages and defects of language and the remedies that ought to be used to avoid the inconveniences of obscurity or uncertainty in the signification of words without which it is impossible to discourse with any clearness or order concerning knowledge which being conversant about propositions and those most commonly universal ones has greater connexion with words than perhaps is suspected these considerations therefore shall be the matter of the following chapters of the signification of words words are sensible signs necessary for communication of ideas man though he have great variety of thoughts and such from which others as well as himself might receive profit and delight yet they are all within his own breast invisible and hidden from others nor can of themselves be made to appear the comfort and advantage of society not being to be had without com munication of thoughts it was necessary that man should find out some external sensible signs whereof those invisible ideas which his thoughts are made up of might be made known to others for this purpose nothing was so fit either for plenty or quickness as those articulate sounds which with so much ease and variety he found himself able to make thus we may conceive how words which were by nature so well adapted to that purpose came to be made use of by men as the signs of their ideas not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas for then there would be but one language amongst all men but by a voluntary imposition whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea the use then of words is to be sensible marks of ideas and the ideas they stand for are their proper and immediate signification words in their immediate signification are the sensible signs of his ideas who uses them the use men have of these marks being either to record their own thoughts for the assistance of their own memory or as it were to bring out their ideas and lay them before the view of others words in their primary or immediate signification stand for nothing but the ideas in the mind of him that uses them how imperfectly soever or carelessly those ideas are collected from the things which they are supposed to represent when a man speaks to another it is that he may be understood and the end of speech is that those sounds as marks may make known his ideas to the hearer that then which words are the marks of are the ideas of the speaker nor can any one apply them as marks immediately to anything else but the ideas that he himself hath for this would be to make them signs of his own conceptions and yet apply them to other ideas which would be to make them signs and not signs of his ideas at the same time and so in effect to have no signification at all words being voluntary signs they cannot be voluntary signs imposed by him on things he knows not that would be to make them signs of nothing sounds without signification a man cannot make his words the signs either of qualities in things or of conceptions in the mind of another whereof he has none in his own till he has some ideas of his own he cannot suppose them to correspond with the conceptions of another man nor can he use any signs for them of another man nor can he use any signs for them for thus they would be the signs of he knows not what which is in truth to be the signs of nothing but when he represents to himself other mens ideas by some of his own if he consent to give them the same names that other men do it is still to his own ideas to ideas that he has and not to ideas that he has not examples of this this is so necessary in the use of language that in this respect the knowing and the ignorant the learned and the unlearned use the words they speak with any meaning all alike they in every mans mouth stand for the ideas he has and which he would express by them a child having taken notice of nothing in the metal he hears called gold but the bright shining yellow colour he applies the word gold only to his own idea of that colour and nothing else and therefore calls the same colour in a peacocks tail gold another that hath better observed adds to shining yellow great weight and then the sound gold when he uses it stands for a complex idea of a shining yellow and a very weighty substance another adds to those qualities fusibility and then the word gold signifies to him a body bright yellow fusible and very heavy another adds malleability each of these uses equally the word gold when they have occasion to express the idea which they have applied it to but it is evident that each can apply it only to his own idea nor can he make it stand as a sign of such a complex idea as he has not words are often secretly referred first to the ideas supposed to be in other mens minds but though words as they are used by men can properly and immediately signify nothing but the ideas that are in the mind of the speaker yet they in their thoughts give them a secret reference to two other things first they suppose their words to be marks of the ideas in the minds also of other men with whom they communicate for else they should talk in vain and could not be understood if the sounds they applied to one idea were such as by the hearer were applied to another which is to speak two languages but in this men stand not usually to examine whether the idea they and those they discourse with have in their minds be the same but think it enough that they use the word as they imagine in the common acceptation of that language in which they suppose that the idea they make it a sign of is precisely the same to which the understanding men of that country apply that name to the reality of things secondly because men would not be thought to talk barely of their own imagination but of things as really they are therefore they often suppose the words to stand also for the reality of things but this relating more particularly to substances and their names as perhaps the former does to simple ideas and modes we shall speak of these two different ways of applying words more at large when we come to treat of the names of mixed modes and substances in particular though give me leave here to say that it is a perverting the use of words and brings unavoidable obscurity and confusion into whenever we make them stand for anything but those ideas we have in our own minds words by use readily excite ideas of their objects concerning words also it is further to be considered first that they being immediately the signs of mens ideas and by that means the instruments whereby men communicate their conceptions and express to one another those thoughts and imaginations they have within their own their own breasts there comes by constant use to be such a connexion between certain sounds and the ideas they stand for that the names heard almost as readily excite certain ideas as if the objects themselves which are apt to produce them did actually affect the senses which is manifestly so in all obvious sensible qualities and in all substances that frequently and familiarly occur to us words are often used without signification and why secondly that though the proper and immediate signification of words are ideas in the mind of the speaker yet because by familiar use from our cradles we come to learn certain articulate sounds very perfectly and have them readily on our tongues and always at hand in our memories but yet are not always careful to ex amine or settle their significations perfectly it often happens that men even when they would apply themselves to an attentive consideration do set their thoughts more on words than things nay because words are many of them learned before the ideas are known for which they stand therefore some not only children but men speak several words no otherwise than parrots do only because they have learned them and have been accustomed to those sounds but so far as words are of use and signification so far is there a constant connexion between the sound and the idea and a designation that the one stands for the other without which application of them they are nothing but so much insignificant noise their signification perfectly arbitrary not the consequence of a natural connexion words by long and familiar use as has been said come to excite in men certain ideas so constantly and readily that they are apt to suppose a natural connexion between them but that they signify only mens peculiar ideas and that by a perfect arbitrary imposition is evident in that they often fail to excite in others even that use the same language the same ideas we take them to be signs of and every man has so inviolable a liberty to make words stand for what ideas he pleases that no one hath the power to make others have the same ideas in their minds that he has when they use the same words that he does and therefore the great augustus himself in the possession of that power which ruled the world acknowledged he could not make a new latin word which was as much as to say that he could not arbitrarily appoint what idea any sound should be a sign of in the mouths and common language of his subjects it is true common use by a tacit consent appropriates certain sounds to certain ideas in all languages which so far limits the signification of that sound that unless a man applies it to the same idea he does not speak properly and let me add that unless a mans words excite the same ideas in the hearer which he makes them stand for in speaking he does not speak intelligibly but whatever be the consequence of any mans using of words differently either from their general meaning or the particular sense of the person to whom he addresses them this is certain their signification in his use of them is limited to his ideas and they can be signs of nothing else of general terms the greatest part of words are general terms all things that exist being particulars it may perhaps be thought reasonable that words which ought to be conformed to things should be so tooi mean in their signification but yet we find quite the contrary the far greatest part of words that make all languages are general terms which has not been the effect of neglect or chance but of reason and necessity that every particular thing should have a name for itself is impossible first it is impossible that every particular thing should have a distinct peculiar name for the signification and use of words depending on that connexion which the mind makes between its ideas and the sounds it uses as signs of them it is necessary in the application of names to things that the mind should have distinct ideas of the things and retain also the particular name that belongs to every one with its peculiar appropriation to that idea but it is beyond the power of human capacity to frame and retain distinct ideas of all the particular things we meet with every bird and beast men saw every tree and plant that affected the senses could not find a place in the most capacious understanding if it be looked on as an instance of a prodigious memory that some generals have been able to call every soldier in their army by his proper name we may easily find a reason why men have never attempted to give names to each sheep in their flock or crow that flies over their heads much less to call every leaf of plants or grain of sand that came in their way by a peculiar name and would be useless if it were possible secondly if it were possible it would yet be useless because it would not serve to the chief end of language men would in vain heap up names of particular things that would not serve them to communicate their thoughts men learn names and use them in talk with others only that they may be understood which is then only done when by use or consent the sound i make by the organs of speech excites in another mans mind who hears it the idea i apply it to in mine when i speak it this cannot be done by names applied to particular things whereof i alone having the ideas in my mind the names of them could not be significant or intelligible to another who was not acquainted with all those very particular things which had fallen under my notice a distinct name for every particular thing not fitted for enlargement of knowledge thirdly but yet granting this also feasible which i think is not yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge which though founded in particular things enlarges itself by general views to which things reduced into sorts under general names are properly subservient these with the names belonging to them come within some compass and do not multiply every moment beyond what either the mind can contain or use requires and therefore in these men have for the most part stopped but yet not so as to hinder themselves from distinguishing particular things by appropriated names where convenience demands it and therefore in their own species which they have most to do with and wherein they have often occasion to mention particular persons they make use of proper names and there distinct individuals have distinct denominations what things have proper names and why besides persons countries also cities rivers mountains and other the like distinctions of place have usually found peculiar names and that for the same reason they being such as men have often an occasion to mark particularly and as it were set before others in their discourses with them and i doubt not but if we had reason to mention particular horses as often as we have to mention particular men we should have proper names for the one as familiar as for the other and bucephalus would be a word as much in use as alexander and therefore we see that amongst jockeys horses have their proper names to be known and distinguished by as commonly as their servants because amongst them there is often occasion to mention this or that particular horse when he is out of sight how general words are made the next thing to be considered ishow general words come to be made for since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms or where find we those general natures they are supposed to stand for words become general by being made the signs of general ideas and ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of time and place and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence by this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more individuals than one each of which having in it a conformity to that abstract idea is as we call it of that sort shown by the way we enlarge our complex ideas from infancy but to deduce this a little more distinctly it will not perhaps be amiss to trace our notions and names from their beginning and observe by what degrees we proceed and by what steps we enlarge our ideas from our first infancy there is nothing more evident than that the ideas of the persons children converse with to instance in them alone are like the persons themselves only particular the ideas of the nurse and the mother are well framed in their minds and like pictures of them there represent only those individuals the names they first gave to them are confined to these individuals and the names of nurse and mamma the child uses determine themselves to those persons afterwards when time and a larger acquaintance have made them observe that there are a great many other things in the world that in some common agreements of shape and several other qualities resemble their father and mother and those persons they have been used to they frame an idea which they find those many particulars do partake in and to that they give with others the name man for example and thus they come to have a general name and a general idea wherein they make nothing new but only leave out of the complex idea they had of peter and james mary and jane that which is peculiar to each and retain only what is common to them all and further enlarge our complex ideas by still leaving out properties contained in them by the same way that they come by the general name and idea of man they easily advance to more general names and notions for observing that several things that differ from their idea of man and cannot therefore be comprehended under that name have yet certain qualities wherein they agree with man by retaining only those qualities and uniting them into one idea they have again another and more general idea to which having given a name they make a term of a more comprehensive extension which new idea is made not by any new addition but only as before by leaving out the shape and some other properties signified by the name man and retaining only a body with life sense and spontaneous motion comprehended under the name animal general natures are nothing but abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones that this is the way whereby men first formed general ideas and general names to them i think is so evident that there needs no other proof of it but the considering of a mans self or others and the ordinary proceedings of their minds in knowledge and he that thinks general natures or notions are anything else but such abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones taken at first from particular existences will i fear be at a loss where to find them for let any one effect and then tell me wherein does his idea of man differ from that of peter and paul or his idea of horse from that of bucephalus but in the leaving out something that is peculiar to each individual and retaining so much of those particular complex ideas of several particular existences as they are found to agree in of the complex ideas signified by the names man and horse leaving out but those particulars wherein they differ and retaining only those wherein they agree and of those making a new distinct complex idea and giving the name animal to it one has a more general term that comprehends with man several other creatures leave out of the idea of animal sense and spontaneous motion and the remaining complex idea made up of the remaining simple ones of body life and nourishment becomes a more general one under the more comprehensive term vivens and not to dwell longer upon this particular so evident in itself by the same way the mind proceeds to body substance and at last to being thing and such universal terms which stand for any of our ideas whatsoever to conclude this whole mystery of genera and species which make such a noise in the schools and are with justice so little regarded out of them is nothing else but abstract ideas more or less comprehensive with names annexed to them in all which this is constant and unvariable that every more general term stands for such an idea and is but a part of any of those contained under it why the genus is ordinarily made use of in definitions this may show us the reason why in the defining of words which is nothing but declaring their signification we make use of the genus or next general word that comprehends it which is not out of necessity but only to save the labour of enumerating the several simple ideas which the next general word or genus stands for or perhaps sometimes the shame of not being able to do it but though defining by genus and differentia i crave leave to use these terms of art though originally latin since they most properly suit those notions they are applied to i say though defining by the genus be the shortest way yet i think it may be doubted whether it be the best this i am sure it is not the only and so not absolutely necessary for definition being nothing but making another understand by words what idea the term defined stands for a definition is best made by enumerating those simple ideas that are combined in the signification of the term defined and if instead of such an enumeration men have accustomed themselves to use the next general term it has not been out of necessity or for greater clearness but for quickness and dispatch sake for i think that to one who desired to know what idea the word man stood for if it should be said that man was a solid extended substance having life sense spontaneous motion and the faculty of reasoning i doubt not but the meaning of the term man would be as well understood and the idea it stands for be at least as clearly made known as when it is defined to be a rational animal which by the several definitions of animal vivens and corpus resolves itself into those enumerated ideas i have in explaining the term man followed here the ordinary definition of the schools which though perhaps not the most exact yet serves well enough to my present purpose and one may in this instance see what gave occasion to the rule that a definition must consist of genus and differentia and it suffices to show us the little necessity there is of such a rule or advantage in the strict observing of it for definitions as has been said being only the explaining of one word by several others so that the meaning or idea it stands for may be certainly known languages are not always so made according to the rules of logic that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly expressed by two others experience sufficiently satisfies us to the contrary or else those who have made this rule have done ill that they have given us so few definitions conformable to it but of definitions more in the next chapter general and universal are creatures of the understanding and belong not to the real existence of things to return to general words it is plain by what has been said that general and universal belong not to the real existence of things but are the inventions and creatures of the understanding made by it for its own use and concern only signs whether words or ideas words are general as has been said when used for signs of general ideas and so are applicable indifferently to many particular things and ideas are general when they are set up as the representatives of many particular things but universality belongs not to things themselves which are all of them particular in their existence even those words and ideas which in their signification are general when therefore we quit particulars the generals that rest are only creatures of our own making their general nature being nothing but the capacity they are put into by the understanding of signifying or representing many particulars for the signification they have is nothing but a relation that by the mind of man is added to them abstract ideas are the essences of genera and species the next thing therefore to be considered is what kind of signification it is that general words have for as it is evident that they do not signify barely one particular thing for then they would not be general terms but proper names so on the other side it is as evident they do not signify a plurality for man and men would then signify the same and the distinction of numbers as the grammarians call them would be superfluous and useless that then which general words signify is a sort of things and each of them does that by being a sign of an abstract idea in the mind to which idea as things existing are found to agree so they come to be ranked under that name or which is all one be of that sort whereby it is evident that the essences of the sorts or if the latin word pleases better species of things are nothing else but these abstract ideas for the having the essence of any species being that which makes anything to be of that species and the conformity to the idea to which the name is annexed being that which gives a right to that name the having the essence and the having that conformity must needs be the same thing since to be of any species and to have a right to the name of that species is all one as for example to be a man or of the species man and to have right to the name man is the same thing again to be a man or of the species man and have the essence of a man is the same thing now since nothing can be a man or have a right to the name man but what has a conformity to the abstract idea the name man stands for nor anything be a man or have a right to the species man but what has the essence of that species it follows that the abstract idea for which the name stands and the essence of the species is one and the same from whence it is easy to observe that the essences of the sorts of things and consequently the sorting of things is the workmanship of the understanding that abstracts and makes those general ideas they are the workmanship of the understanding but have their foundation in the similitude of things i would not here be thought to forget much less to deny that nature in the production of things makes several of them alike there is nothing more obvious especially in the race of animals and all things propagated by seed but yet i think we may say the sorting of them under names is the workmanship of the understanding taking occasion from the similitude it observes amongst them to make abstract general ideas and set them up in the mind with names annexed to them as patterns or forms for in that sense the word form has a very proper signification to which as particular things existing are found to agree so they come to be of that species have that denomination or are put into that classis for when we say this is a man that a horse this justice that cruelty this a watch that a jack what do we else but rank things under different specific names as agreeing to those abstract ideas of which we have made those names the signs and what are the essences of those species set out and marked by names but those abstract ideas in the mind which are as it were the bonds between particular things that exist and the names they are to be ranked under and when general names have any connexion with particular beings these abstract ideas are the medium that unites them so that the essences of species as distinguished and denominated by us neither are nor can be anything but those precise abstract ideas we have in our minds and therefore the supposed real essences of substances if different from our abstract ideas cannot be the essences of the species we rank things into for two species may be one as rationally as two different essences be the essence of one species and i demand what are the alterations which may or may not be made in a horse or lead without making either of them to be of another species in determining the species of things by our abstract ideas this is easy to resolve but if any one will regulate himself herein by supposed real essences he will i suppose be at a loss and he will never be able to know when anything precisely ceases to be of the species of a horse or lead each distinct abstract idea is a distinct essence nor will any one wonder that i say these essences or abstract ideas which are the measures of name and the boundaries of species are the workmanship of the un derstanding who considers that at least the complex ones are often in several men different collections of simple ideas and therefore that is covetousness to one man which is not so to another nay even in substances where their abstract ideas seem to be taken from the things themselves they are not constantly the same no not in that species which is most familiar to us and with which we have the most intimate acquaintance it having been more than once doubted whether the foetus born of a woman were a man even so far as that it hath been debated whether it were or were not to be nourished and baptized which could not be if the abstract idea or essence to which the name man belonged were of natures making and were not the uncertain and various collection of simple ideas which the understanding put together and then abstracting it affixed a name to it so that in truth every distinct abstract idea is a distinct essence and the names that stand for such distinct ideas are the names of things essentially different thus a circle is as essentially different from an oval as a sheep from a goat and rain is as essentially different from snow as water from earth that abstract idea which is the essence of one being impossible to be communicated to the other and thus any two abstract ideas that in any part vary one from another with two distinct names annexed to them constitute two distinct sorts or if you please species as essentially different as any two of the most remote or opposite in the world several significations of the word essence but since the essences of things are thought by some and not without reason to be wholly unknown it may not be amiss to consider the several significations of the word essence real essences first essence may be taken for the very being of anything whereby it is what it is and thus the real internal but generally in substances unknown constitution of things whereon their discoverable qualities depend may be called their essence this is the proper original signification of the word as is evident from the formation of it essentia in its primary notation signifying properly being and in this sense it is still used when we speak of the essence of particular things without giving them any name nominal essences secondly the learning and disputes of the schools having been much busied about genus and species the word essence has almost lost its primary signification and instead of the real constitution of things has been almost wholly applied to the artificial constitution of genus and species it is true there is ordinarily supposed a real constitution of the sorts of things and it is past doubt there must be some real constitution on which any collection of simple ideas coexisting must depend but it being evident that things are ranked under names into sorts or species only as they agree to certain abstract ideas to which we have annexed those names the essence of each genus or sort comes to be nothing but that abstract idea which the general or sortal if i may have leave so to call it from sort as i do general from genus name stands for and this we shall find to be that which the word essence imports in its most familiar use these two sorts of essences i suppose may not unfitly be termed the one the real the other nominal essence constant connexion between the name and nominal essence between the nominal essence and the name there is so near a connexion that the name of any sort of things cannot be attributed to any particular being but what has this essence whereby it answers that abstract idea whereof that name is the sign supposition that species are distinguished by their real essences useless concerning the real essences of corporeal substances to mention these only there are if i mistake not two opinions the one is of those who using the word essence for they know not what suppose a certain number of those essences according to which all natural things are made and wherein they do exactly every one of them partake and so become of this or that species the other and more rational opinion is of those who look on all natural things to have a real but unknown constitution of their insensible parts from which flow those sensible qualities which serve us to distinguish them one from another according as we have occasion to rank them into sorts under common denominations the former of these opinions which supposes these essences as a certain number of forms or moulds wherein all natural things that exist are cast and do equally partake has i imagine very much perplexed the knowledge of natural things the frequent productions of monsters in all the species of animals and of changelings and other strange issues of human birth carry with them difficulties not possible to consist with this hypothesis since it is as impossible that two things partaking exactly of the same real essence should have different properties as that two figures partaking of the same real essence of a circle should have different properties but were there no other reason against it yet the supposition of essences that cannot be known and the making of them nevertheless to be that which distinguishes the species of things is so wholly useless and unserviceable to any part of our knowledge that that alone were sufficient to make us lay it by and content ourselves with such essences of the sorts or species of things as come within the reach of our knowledge which when seriously considered will be found as i have said to be nothing else but those abstract complex ideas to which we have annexed distinct general names real and nominal essence the same in simple ideas and modes different in substances essences being thus distinguished into nominal and real we may further observe that in the species of simple ideas and modes they are always the same but in substances always quite different thus a figure including a space between three lines is the real as well as nominal essence of a triangle it being not only the abstract idea to which the general name is annexed but the very essentia or being of the thing itself that foundation from which all its properties flow and to which they are all inseparably annexed but it is far otherwise concerning that parcel of matter which makes the ring on my finger wherein these two essences are apparently different for it is the real constitution of its insensible parts on which depend all those properties of colour weight fusibility fixedness c which are to be found in it which constitution we know not and so having no particular idea of having no name that is the sign of it but yet it is its colour weight fusibility fixedness c which makes it to be gold or gives it a right to that name which is therefore its nominal essence since nothing can be called gold but what has a conformity of qualities to that abstract complex idea to which that name is annexed but this distinction of essences belonging particularly to substances we shall when we come to consider their names have an occasion to treat of more fully essences ingenerable and incorruptible that such abstract ideas with names to them as we have been speaking of are essences may further appear by what we are told concerning essences viz that they are all ingenerable and incorruptible which cannot be true of the real constitutions of things which begin and perish with them all things that exist besides their author are all liable to change especially those things we are acquainted with and have ranked into bands under distinct names or ensigns thus that which was grass today is tomorrow the flesh of a sheep and within a few days after becomes part of a man in all which and the like changes it is evident their real essenceie that constitution whereon the properties of these several things dependedis destroyed and perishes with them but essences being taken for ideas established in the mind with names annexed to them they are supposed to remain steadily the same whatever mutations the particular substances are liable to for whatever becomes of alexander and bucephalus the ideas to which man and horse are annexed are supposed nevertheless to remain the same and so the essences of those species are preserved whole and undestroyed whatever changes happen to any or all of the individuals of those species by this means the essence of a species rests safe and entire without the existence of so much as one individual of that kind for were there now no circle existing anywhere in the world as perhaps that figure exists not anywhere exactly marked out yet the idea annexed to that name would not cease to be what it is nor cease to be as a pattern to determine which of the particular figures we meet with have or have not a right to the name circle and so to show which of them by having that essence was of that species and though there neither were nor had been in nature such a beast as an unicorn or such a fish as a mermaid yet supposing those names to stand for complex abstract ideas that contained no inconsistency in them the essence of a mermaid is as intelligible as that of a man and the idea of an unicorn as certain steady and permanent as that of a horse from what has been said it is evident that the doctrine of the immutability of essences proves them to be only abstract ideas and is founded on the relation established between them and certain sounds as signs of them and will always be true as long as the same name can have the same signification recapitulation to conclude this is that which in short i would say viz that all the great business of genera and species and their essences amounts to no more but thisthat men making abstract ideas and settling them in their minds with names annexed to them do thereby enable themselves to consider things and discourse of them as it were in bundles for the easier and readier improvement and communication of their knowledge which would advance but slowly were their words and thoughts confined only to particulars of the names of simple ideas names of simple ideas modes and substances have each something peculiar though all words as i have shown signify nothing immediately but the ideas in the mind of the speaker yet upon a nearer survey we shall find the names of simple ideas mixed modes under which i comprise relations too and natural substances have each of them something peculiar and different from the other for example names of simple ideas and of substances intimate real existence first the names of simple ideas and substances with the abstract ideas in the mind which they immediately signify intimate also some real existence from which was derived their original pattern but the names of mixed modes terminate in the idea that is in the mind and lead not the thoughts any further as we shall see more at large in the following chapter names of simple ideas and modes signify always both real and nominal essences secondly the names of simple ideas and modes signify always the real as well as nominal essence of their species but the names of natural substances signify rarely if ever anything but barely the nominal essences of those species as we shall show in the chapter that treats of the names of substances in particular names of simple ideas are undefinable thirdly the names of simple ideas are not capable of any definition the names of all complex ideas are it has not that i know been yet observed by anybody what words are and what are not capable of being defined the want whereof is as i am apt to think not seldom the occasion of great wrangling and obscurity in mens discourses whilst some demand definitions of terms that cannot be defined and others think they ought not to rest satisfied in an explication made by a more general word and its restriction or to speak in terms of art by a genus and difference when even after such definition made according to rule those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the meaning of the word than they had before this at least i think that the showing what words are and what are not capable of definitions and wherein consists a good definition is not wholly besides our present purpose and perhaps will afford so much light to the nature of these signs and our ideas as to deserve a more particular consideration if all names were definable it would be a process in infinitum i will not here trouble myself to prove that all terms are not definable from that progress in infinitum which it will visibly lead us into if we should allow that all names could be defined for if the terms of one definition were still to be defined by another where at last should we stop but i shall from the nature of our ideas and the signification of our words show why some names can and others cannot be defined and which they are what a definition is i think it is agreed that a definition is nothing else but the showing the meaning of one word by several other not synonymous terms the meaning of words being only the ideas they are made to stand for by him that uses them the meaning of any term is then showed or the word is defined when by other words the idea it is made the sign of and annexed to in the mind of the speaker is as it were represented or set before the view of another and thus its signification is ascertained this is the only use and end of definitions and therefore the only measure of what is or is not a good definition simple ideas why undefinable this being premised i say that the names of simple ideas and those only are incapable of being defined the reason whereof is this that the several terms of a definition signifying several ideas they can all together by no means represent an idea which has no composition at all and therefore a definition which is properly nothing but the showing the meaning of one word by several others not signifying each the same thing can in the names of simple ideas have no place instances scholastic definitions of motion the not observing this difference in our ideas and their names has produced that eminent trifling in the schools which is so easy to be observed in the definitions they give us of some few of these simple ideas for as to the greatest part of them even those masters of definitions were fain to leave them untouched merely by the impossibility they found in it what more exquisite jargon could the wit of man invent than this definitionthe act of a being in power as far forth as in power which would puzzle any rational man to whom it was not already known by its famous absurdity to guess what word it could ever be supposed to be the explication of if tully asking a dutchman what beweeginge was should have received this explication in his own language that it was actus entis in potentia quatenus in potentia i ask whether any one can imagine he could thereby have understood what the word beweeginge signified or have guessed what idea a dutchman ordinarily had in his mind and would signify to another when he used that sound modern definitions of motion nor have the modern philosophers who have endeavoured to throw off the jargon of the schools and speak intelligibly much bet ter succeeded in defining simple ideas whether by explaining their causes or any otherwise the atomists who define motion to be a passage from one place to another what do they more than put one synonymous word for another for what is passage other than motion and if they were asked what passage was how would they better define it than by motion for is it not at least as proper and significant to say passage is a motion from one place to another as to say motion is a passage c this is to translate and not to define when we change two words of the same signification one for another which when one is better understood than the other may serve to discover what idea the unknown stands for but is very far from a definition unless we will say every english word in the dictionary is the definition of the latin word it answers and that motion is a definition of motus nor will the successive application of the parts of the superficies of one body to those of another which the cartesians give us prove a much better definition of motion when well examined definitions of light the act of perspicuous as far forth as perspicuous is another peripatetic definition of a simple idea which though not more absurd than the former of motion yet betrays its uselessness and insignificancy more plainly because experience will easily convince any one that it cannot make the meaning of the word light which it pretends to define at all understood by a blind man but the definition of motion appears not at first sight so useless because it escapes this way of trial for this simple idea entering by the touch as well as sight it is impossible to show an example of any one who has no other way to get the idea of motion but barely by the definition of that name those who tell us that light is a great number of little globules striking briskly on the bottom of the eye speak more intelligibly than the schools but yet these words never so well understood would make the idea the word light stands for no more known to a man that understands it not before than if one should tell him that light was nothing but a company of little tennisballs which fairies all day long struck with rackets against some mens foreheads whilst they passed by others for granting this explication of the thing to be true yet the idea of the cause of light if we had it never so exact would no more give us the idea of light itself as it is such a particular perception in us than the idea of the figure and motion of a sharp piece of steel would give us the idea of that pain which it is able to cause in us for the cause of any sensation and the sensation itself in all the simple ideas of one sense are two ideas and two ideas so different and distant one from another that no two can be more so and therefore should descartess globules strike never so long on the retina of a man who was blind by a gutta serena he would thereby never have any idea of light or anything approaching it though he understood never so well what little globules were and what striking on another body was and therefore the cartesians very well distinguish between that light which is the cause of that sensation in us and the idea which is produced in us by it and is that which is properly light simple ideas why undefinable further explained simple ideas as has been shown are only to be got by those impressions objects themselves make on our minds by the proper inlets appointed to each sort if they are not received this way all the words in the world made use of to explain or define any of their names will never be able to produce in us the idea it stands for for words being sounds can produce in us no other simple ideas than of those very sounds nor excite any in us but by that voluntary connexion which is known to be between them and those simple ideas which common use has made them the signs of he that thinks otherwise let him try if any words can give him the taste of a pineapple and make him have the true idea of the relish of that celebrated delicious fruit so far as he is told it has a resemblance with any tastes whereof he has the ideas already in his memory imprinted there by sensible objects not strangers to his palate so far may he approach that resemblance in his mind but this is not giving us that idea by a definition but exciting in us other simple ideas by their known names which will be still very different from the true taste of that fruit itself in light and colours and all other simple ideas it is the same thing for the signification of sounds is not natural but only imposed and arbitrary and no definition of light or redness is more fitted or able to produce either of those ideas in us than the sound light or red by itself for to hope to produce an idea of light or colour by a sound however formed is to expect that sounds should be visible or colours audible and to make the ears do the office of all the other senses which is all one as to say that we might taste smell and see by the ears a sort of philosophy worthy only of sancho panza who had the faculty to see dulcinea by hearsay and therefore he that has not before received into his mind by the proper inlet the simple idea which any word stands for can never come to know the signification of that word by any other words or sounds whatsoever put together according to any rules of definition the only way is by applying to his senses the proper object and so producing that idea in him for which he has learned the name already a studious blind man who had mightily beat his head about visible objects and made use of the explication of his books and friends to understand those names of light and colours which often came in his way bragged one day that he now understood what scarlet signified upon which his friend demanding what scarlet was the blind man answered it was like the sound of a trumpet just such an understanding of the name of any other simple idea will he have who hopes to get it only from a definition or other words made use of to explain it the contrary shown in complex ideas by instances of a statue and rainbow the case is quite otherwise in complex ideas which consisting of several simple ones it is in the power of words standing for the several ideas that make that composition to imprint complex ideas in the mind which were never there before and so make their names be understood in such collections of ideas passing under one name definition or the teaching the signification of one word by several others has place and may make us understand the names of things which never came within the reach of our senses and frame ideas suitable to those in other mens minds when they use those names provided that none of the terms of the definition stand for any such simple ideas which he to whom the explication is made has never yet had in his thought thus the word statue may be explained to a blind man by other words when picture cannot his senses having given him the idea of figure but not of colours which therefore words cannot excite in him this gained the prize to the painter against the statuary each of which contending for the excellency of his art and the statuary bragging that his was to be preferred because it reached further and even those who had lost their eyes could yet perceive the excellency of it the painter agreed to refer himself to the judgment of a blind man who being brought where there was a statue made by the one and a picture drawn by the other he was first led to the statue in which he traced with his hands all the lineaments of the face and body and with great admiration applauded the skill of the workman but being led to the picture and having his hands laid upon it was told that now he touched the head and then the forehead eyes nose c as his hand moved over the parts of the picture on the cloth without finding any the least distinction whereupon he cried out that certainly that must needs be a very admirable and divine piece of workmanship which could represent to them all those parts where he could neither feel nor perceive anything colours indefinable to the bornblind he that should use the word rainbow to one who knew all those colours but yet had never seen that phenomenon would by enumerating the figure largeness position and order of the colours so well define that word that it might be perfectly understood but yet that definition how exact and perfect soever would never make a blind man understand it because several of the simple ideas that make that complex one being such as he never received by sensation and experience no words are able to excite them in his mind complex ideas definable only when the simple ideas of which they consist have been got from experience simple ideas as has been shown can only be got by experience from those objects which are proper to produce in us those perceptions when by this means we have our minds stored with them and know the names for them then we are in a condition to define and by definition to understand the names of complex ideas that are made up of them but when any term stands for a simple idea that a man has never yet had in his mind it is impossible by any words to make known its meaning to him when any term stands for an idea a man is acquainted with but is ignorant that that term is the sign of it then another name of the same idea which he has been accustomed to may make him understand its meaning but in no case whatsoever is any name of any simple idea capable of a definition names of simple ideas of less doubtful meaning than those of mixed modes and substances fourthly but though the names of simple ideas have not the help of definition to determine their signification yet that hinders not but that they are generally less doubtful and uncertain than those of mixed modes and substances because they standing only for one simple perception men for the most part easily and perfectly agree in their signification and there is little room for mistake and wrangling about their meaning he that knows once that whiteness is the name of that colour he has observed in snow or milk will not be apt to misapply that word as long as he retains that idea which when he has quite lost he is not apt to mistake the meaning of it but perceives he understands it not there is neither a multiplicity of simple ideas to be put together which makes the doubtfulness in the names of mixed modes nor a supposed but an unknown real essence with properties depending thereon the precise number whereof is also unknown which makes the difficulty in the names of substances but on the contrary in simple ideas the whole signification of the name is known at once and consists not of parts whereof more or less being put in the idea may be varied and so the signification of name be obscure or uncertain simple ideas have few ascents in linea praedicamentali fifthly this further may be observed concerning simple ideas and their names that they have but few ascents in linea praedicamentali as they call it from the lowest species to the summum genus the reason whereof is that the lowest species being but one simple idea nothing can be left out of it that so the difference being taken away it may agree with some other thing in one idea common to them both which having one name is the genus of the other two vg there is nothing that can be left out of the idea of white and red to make them agree in one common appearance and so have one general name as rationality being left out of the complex idea of man makes it agree with brute in the more general idea and name of animal and therefore when to avoid unpleasant enumerations men would comprehend both white and red and several other such simple ideas under one general name they have been fain to do it by a word which denotes only the way they get into the mind for when white red and yellow are all comprehended under the genus or name colour it signifies no more but such ideas as are produced in the mind only by the sight and have entrance only through the eyes and when they would frame yet a more general term to comprehend both colours and sounds and the like simple ideas they do it by a word that signifies all such as come into the mind only by one sense and so the general term quality in its ordinary acceptation comprehends colours sounds tastes smells and tangible qualities with distinction from extension number motion pleasure and pain which make impressions on the mind and introduce their ideas by more senses than one names of simple ideas not arbitrary but perfectly taken from the existence of things sixthly the names of simple ideas substances and mixed modes have also this difference that those of mixed modes stand for ideas perfectly arbitrary those of substances are not perfectly so but refer to a pattern though with some latitude and those of simple ideas are perfectly taken from the existence of things and are not arbitrary at an which what difference it makes in the significations of their names we shall see in the following chapters simple modes the names of simple modes differ little from those of simple ideas of the names of mixed modes and relations mixed modes stand for abstract ideas as other general names the names of mixed modes being general they stand as has been shewed for sorts or species of things each of which has its peculiar essence the essences of these species also as has been shewed are nothing but the abstract ideas in the mind to which the name is annexed thus far the names and essences of mixed modes have nothing but what is common to them with other ideas but if we take a little nearer survey of them we shall find that they have something peculiar which perhaps may deserve our attention first the abstract ideas they stand for are made by the understanding the first particularity i shall observe in them is that the abstract ideas or if you please the essences of the several species of mixed modes are made by the understanding wherein they differ from those of simple ideas in which sort the mind has no power to make any one but only receives such as are presented to it by the real existence of things operating upon it secondly made arbitrarily and without patterns in the next place these essences of the species of mixed modes are not only made by the mind but made very arbitrarily made without patterns or reference to any real existence wherein they differ from those of substances which carry with them the supposition of some real being from which they are taken and to which they are comformable but in its complex ideas of mixed modes the mind takes a liberty not to follow the existence of things exactly it unites and retains certain collections as so many distinct specific ideas whilst others that as often occur in nature and are as plainly suggested by outward things pass neglected without particular names or specifications nor does the mind in these of mixed modes as in the complex idea of substances examine them by the real existence of things or verify them by patterns containing such peculiar compositions in nature to know whether his idea of adultery or incest be right will a man seek it anywhere amongst things existing or is it true because any one has been witness to such an action no but it suffices here that men have put together such a collection into one complex idea that makes the archetype and specific idea whether ever any such action were committed in rerum natura or no how this is done to understand this right we must consider wherein this making of these complex ideas consists and that is not in the making any new idea but putting together those which the mind had before wherein the mind does these three things first it chooses a certain number secondly it gives them connexion and makes them into one idea thirdly it ties them together by a name if we examine how the mind proceeds in these and what liberty it takes in them we shall easily observe how these essences of the species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the mind and consequently that the species themselves are of mens making evidently arbitrary in that the idea is often before the existence nobody can doubt but that these ideas of mixed modes are made by a voluntary collection of ideas put together in the mind independent from any original patterns in nature who will but reflect that this sort of complex ideas may be made abstracted and have names given them and so a species be constituted before any one individual of that species ever existed who can doubt but the ideas of sacrilege or adultery might be framed in the minds of men and have names given them and so these species of mixed modes be constituted before either of them was ever committed and might be as well discoursed of and reasoned about and as certain truths discovered of them whilst yet they had no being but in the understanding as well as now that they have but too frequently a real existence whereby it is plain how much the sorts of mixed modes are the creatures of the understanding where they have a being as subservient to all the ends of real truth and knowledge as when they really exist and we cannot doubt but lawmakers have often made laws about species of actions which were only the creatures of their own understandings beings that had no other existence but in their own minds and i think nobody can deny but that the resurrection was a species of mixed modes in the mind before it really existed instances murder incest stabbing to see how arbitrarily these essences of mixed modes are made by the mind we need but take a view of almost any of them a little looking into them will satisfy us that it is the mind that combines several scattered independent ideas into one complex one and by the common name it gives them makes them the essence of a certain species without regulating itself by any connexion they have in nature for what greater connexion in nature has the idea of a man than the idea of a sheep with killing that this is made a particular species of action signified by the word murder and the other not or what union is there in nature between the idea of the relation of a father with killing than that of a son or neighbour that those are combined into one complex idea and thereby made the essence of the distinct species parricide whilst the other makes no distinct species at all but though they have made killing a mans father or mother a distinct species from killing his son or daughter yet in some other cases son and daughter are taken in too as well as father and mother and they are all equally comprehended in the same species as in that of incest thus the mind in mixed modes arbitrarily unites into complex ideas such as it finds convenient whilst others that have altogether as much union in nature are left loose and never combined into one idea because they have no need of one name it is evident then that the mind by its free choice gives a connexion to a certain number of ideas which in nature have no more union with one another than others that it leaves out why else is the part of the weapon the beginning of the wound is made with taken notice of to make the distinct species called stabbing and the figure and matter of the weapon left out i do not say this is done without reason as we shall see more by and by but this i say that it is done by the free choice of the mind pursuing its own ends and that therefore these species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the understanding and there is nothing more evident than that for the most part in the framing of these ideas the mind searches not its patterns in nature nor refers the ideas it makes to the real existence of things but puts such together as may best serve its own purposes without tying itself to a precise imitation of anything that really exists but still subservient to the end of language and not made at random but though these complex ideas or essences of mixed modes depend on the mind and are made by it with great liberty yet they are not made at random and jumbled together without any reason at all though these complex ideas be not always copied from nature yet they are always suited to the end for which abstract ideas are made and though they be combinations made of ideas that are loose enough and have as little union in themselves as several others to which the mind never gives a connexion that combines them into one idea yet they are always made for the convenience of communication which is the chief end of language the use of language is by short sounds to signify with ease and dispatch general conceptions wherein not only abundance of particulars may be contained but also a great variety of independent ideas collected into one complex one in the making therefore of the species of mixed modes men have had regard only to such combinations as they had occasion to mention one to another those they have combined into distinct complex ideas and given names to whilst others that in nature have as near a union are left loose and unregarded for to go no further than human actions themselves if they would make distinct abstract ideas of all the varieties which might be observed in them the number must be infinite and the memory confounded with the plenty as well as overcharged to little purpose it suffices that men make and name so many complex ideas of these mixed modes as they find they have occasion to have names for in the ordinary occurrence of their affairs if they join to the idea of killing the idea of father or mother and so make a distinct species from killing a mans son or neighbour it is because of the different heinousness of the crime and the distinct punishment is due to the murdering a mans father and mother different to what ought to be inflicted on the murderer of a son or neighbour and therefore they find it necessary to mention it by a distinct name which is the end of making that distinct combination but though the ideas of mother and daughter are so differently treated in reference to the idea of killing that the one is joined with it to make a distinct abstract idea with a name and so a distinct species and the other not yet in respect of carnal knowledge they are both taken in under incest and that still for the same convenience of expressing under one name and reckoning of one species such unclean mixtures as have a peculiar turpitude beyond others and this to avoid circumlocutions and tedious descriptions whereof the intranslatable words of divers languages are a proof a moderate skill in different languages will easily satisfy one of the truth of this it being so obvious to observe great store of words in one language which have not any that answer them in another which plainly shows that those of one country by their customs and manner of life have found occasion to make several complex ideas and given names to them which others never collected into specific ideas this could not have happened if these species were the steady workmanship of nature and not collections made and abstracted by the mind in order to naming and for the convenience of communication the terms of our law which are not empty sounds will hardly find words that answer them in the spanish or italian no scanty languages much less i think could any one translate them into the caribbee or westoe tongues and the versura of the romans or corban of the jews have no words in other languages to answer them the reason whereof is plain from what has been said nay if we look a little more nearly into this matter and exactly compare different languages we shall find that though they have words which in translations and dictionaries are supposed to answer one another yet there is scarce one of ten amongst the names of complex ideas especially of mixed modes that stands for the same precise idea which the word does that in dictionaries it is rendered by there are no ideas more common and less compounded than the measures of time extension and weight and the latin names hora pes libra are without difficulty rendered by the english names hour foot and pound but yet there is nothing more evident than that the ideas a roman annexed to these latin names were very far different from those which an englishman expresses by those english ones and if either of these should make use of the measures that those of the other language designed by their names he would be quite out in his account these are too sensible proofs to be doubted and we shall find this much more so in the names of more abstract and compounded ideas such as are the greatest part of those which make up moral discourses whose names when men come curiously to compare with those they are translated into in other languages they will find very few of them exactly to correspond in the whole extent of their significations this shows species to be made for communication the reason why i take so particular notice of this is that we may not be mistaken about genera and species and their essences as if they were things regularly and constantly made by nature and had a real existence in things when they appear upon a more wary survey to be nothing else but an artifice of the understanding for the easier signifying such collections of ideas as it should often have occasion to communicate by one general term under which divers particulars as far forth as they agreed to that abstract idea might be comprehended and if the doubtful signification of the word species may make it sound harsh to some that i say the species of mixed modes are made by the understanding yet i think it can by nobody be denied that it is the mind makes those abstract complex ideas to which specific names are given and if it be true as it is that the mind makes the patterns for sorting and naming of things i leave it to be considered who makes the boundaries of the sort or species since with me species and sort have no other difference than that of a latin and english idiom in mixed modes it is the name that ties the combination of simple ideas together and makes it a species the near relation that there is between species essences and their general name at least in mixed modes will further appear when we consider that it is the name that seems to preserve those essences and give them their lasting duration for the connexion between the loose parts of those complex ideas being made by the mind this union which has no particular foundation in nature would cease again were there not something that did as it were hold it together and keep the parts from scattering though therefore it be the mind that makes the collection it is the name which is as it were the knot that ties them fast together what a vast variety of different ideas does the word triumphus hold together and deliver to us as one species had this name been never made or quite lost we might no doubt have had descriptions of what passed in that solemnity but yet i think that which holds those different parts together in the unity of one complex idea is that very word annexed to it without which the several parts of that would no more be thought to make one thing than any other show which having never been made but once had never been united into one complex idea under one denomination how much therefore in mixed modes the unity necessary to any essence depends on the mind and how much the continuation and fixing of that unity depends on the name in common use annexed to it i leave to be considered by those who look upon essences and species as real established things in nature suitable to this we find that men speaking of mixed modes seldom imagine or take any other for species of them but such as are set out by name because they being of mans making only in order to naming no such species are taken notice of or supposed to be unless a name be joined to it as the sign of mans having combined into one idea several loose ones and by that name giving a lasting union to the parts which would otherwise cease to have any as soon as the mind laid by that abstract idea and ceased actually to think on it but when a name is once annexed to it wherein the parts of that complex idea have a settled and permanent union then is the essence as it were established and the species looked on as complete for to what purpose should the memory charge itself with such compositions unless it were by abstraction to make them gen eral and to what purpose make them general unless it were that they might have general names for the convenience of discourse and communication thus we see that killing a man with a sword or a hatchet are looked on as no distinct species of action but if the point of the sword first enter the body it passes for a distinct species where it has a distinct name as in england in whose language it is called stabbing but in another country where it has not happened to be specified under a peculiar name it passes not for a distinct species but in the species of corporeal substances though it be the mind that makes the nominal essence yet since those ideas which are combined in it are supposed to have an union in nature whether the mind joins them or not therefore those are looked on as distinct species without any operation of the mind either abstracting or giving a name to that complex idea for the originals of our mixed modes we look no further than the mind which also shows them to he the workmanship of the understanding conformable also to what has been said concerning the essences of the species of mixed modes that they are the creatures of the understanding rather than the works of nature conformable i say to this we find that their names lead our thoughts to the mind and no further when we speak of justice or gratitude we frame to ourselves no imagination of anything existing which we would conceive but our thoughts terminate in the abstract ideas of those virtues and look not further as they do when we speak of a horse or iron whose specific ideas we consider not as barely in the mind but as in things themselves which afford the original patterns of those ideas but in mixed modes at least the most considerable parts of them which are moral beings we consider the original patterns as being in the mind and to those we refer for the distinguishing of particular beings under names and hence i think it is that these essences of the species of mixed modes are by a more particular name called notions as by a peculiar right appertaining to the understanding their being made by the understanding without patterns shows the reason why they are so compounded hence likewise we may learn why the complex ideas of mixed modes are commonly more compounded and decompounded than those of natural substances because they being the workmanship of the understanding pursuing only its own ends and the conveniency of expressing in short those ideas it would make known to another it does with great liberty unite often into one abstract idea things that in their nature have no coherence and so under one term bundle together a great variety of compounded and decompounded ideas thus the name of procession what a great mixture of independent ideas of persons habits tapers orders motions sounds does it contain in that complex one which the mind of man has arbitrarily put together to express by that one name whereas the complex ideas of the sorts of substances are usually made up of only a small number of simple ones and in the species of animals these two viz shape and voice commonly make the whole nominal essence names of mixed modes stand always for their real essences which are the workmanship of our minds another thing we may observe from what has been said is that the names of mixed modes always signify when they have any determined signification the real essences of their species for these abstract ideas being the workmanship of the mind and not referred to the real existence of things there is no supposition of anything more signified by that name but barely that complex idea the mind itself has formed which is all it would have expressed by it and is that on which all the properties of the species depend and from which alone they all flow and so in these the real and nominal essence is the same which of what concernment it is to the certain knowledge of general truth we shall see hereafter why their names are usually got before their ideas this also may show us the reason why for the most part the names of fixed modes are got before the ideas they stand for are perfectly known because there being no species of these ordinarily taken notice of but what have names and those species or rather their essences being abstract complex ideas made arbitrarily by the mind it is convenient if not necessary to know the names before one endeavour to frame these complex ideas unless a man will fill his head with a company of abstract complex ideas which others having no names for he has nothing to do with but to lay by and forget again i confess that in the beginning of languages it was necessary to have the idea before one gave it the name and so it is still where making a new complex idea one also by giving it a new name makes a new word but this concerns not languages made which have generally pretty well provided for ideas which men have frequent occasion to have and communicate and in such i ask whether it be not the ordinary method that children learn the names of mixed modes before they have their ideas what one of a thousand ever frames the abstract ideas of glory and ambition before he has heard the names of them in simple ideas and substances i grant it is otherwise which being such ideas as have a real existence and union in nature the ideas and names are got one before the other as it happens reason of my being so large on this subject what has been said here of mixed modes is with very little difference applicable also to relations which since every man himself may observe i may spare myself the pains to enlarge on especially since what i have here said concerning words in this third book will possibly be thought by some to be much more than what so slight a subject required i allow it might be brought into a narrower compass but i was willing to stay my reader on an argument that appears to me new and a little out of the way i am sure it is one i thought not of when i began to write that by searching it to the bottom and turning it on every side some part or other might meet with every ones thoughts and give occasion to the most averse or negligent to reflect on a general miscarriage which though of great consequence is little taken notice of when it is considered what a pudder is made about essences and how much all sorts of knowledge discourse and conversation are pestered and disordered by the careless and confused use and application of words it will perhaps be thought worth while thoroughly to lay it open and i shall be pardoned if i have dwelt long on an argument which i think therefore needs to be incul cated because the faults men are usually guilty of in this kind are not only the greatest hindrances of true knowledge but are so well thought of as to pass for it men would often see what a small pittance of reason and truth or possibly none at all is mixed with those huffing opinions they are swelled with if they would but look beyond fashionable sounds and observe what ideas are or are not comprehended under those words with which they are so armed at all points and with which they so confidently lay about them i shall imagine i have done some service to truth peace and learning if by any enlargement on this subject i can make men reflect on their own use of language and give them reason to suspect that since it is frequent for others it may also be possible for them to have sometimes very good and approved words in their mouths and writings with very uncertain little or no signification and therefore it is not unreasonable for them to be wary herein themselves and not to be unwilling to have them examined by others with this design therefore i shall go on with what i have further to say concerning this matter i of the names of substances the common names of substances stand for sorts the common names of substances as well as other general terms stand for sorts which is nothing else but the being made signs of such complex ideas wherein several particular substances do or might agree by virtue of which they are capable of being comprehended in one common conception and signified by one name i say do or might agree for though there be but one sun existing in the world yet the idea of it being abstracted so that more substances if there were several might each agree in it it is as much a sort as if there were as many suns as there are stars they want not their reasons who think there are and that each fixed star would answer the idea the name sun stands for to one who was placed in a due distance which by the way may show us how much the sorts or if you please genera and species of things for those latin terms signify to me no more than the english word sort depend on such collections of ideas as men have made and not on the real nature of things since it is not impossible but that in propriety of speech that might be a sun to one which is a star to another the essence of each sort of substance is our abstract idea to which the name is annexed the measure and boundary of each sort or species whereby it is constituted that particular sort and distinguished from others is that we call its essence which is nothing but that abstract idea to which the name is annexed so that everything contained in that idea is essential to that sort this though it be all the essence of natural substances that we know or by which we distinguish them into sorts yet i call it by a peculiar name the nominal essence to distinguish it from the real constitution of substances upon which depends this nominal essence and all the properties of that sort which therefore as has been said may be called the real essence vg the nominal essence of gold is that complex idea the word gold stands for let it be for instance a body yellow of a certain weight malleable fusible and fixed but the real essence is the constitution of the insensible parts of that body on which those qualities and all the other properties of gold depend how far these two are different though they are both called essence is obvious at first sight to discover the nominal and real essence different for though perhaps voluntary motion with sense and reason joined to a body of a certain shape be the complex idea to which i and others annex the name man and so be the nominal essence of the species so called yet nobody will say that complex idea is the real essence and source of all those operations which are to be found in any individual of that sort the foundation of all those qualities which are the ingredients of our complex idea is something quite different and had we such a knowledge of that constitution of man from which his faculties of moving sensation and reasoning and other powers flow and on which his so regular shape depends as it is possible angels have and it is certain his maker has we should have a quite other idea of his essence than what now is contained in our definition of that species be it what it will and our idea of any individual man would be as far different from what it is now as is his who knows all the springs and wheels and other contrivances within of the famous clock at strasburg from that which a gazing countryman has of it who barely sees the motion of the hand and hears the clock strike and observes only some of the outward appearances nothing essential to individuals that essence in the ordinary use of the word relates to sorts and that it is considered in particular beings no further than as they are ranked into sorts appears from hence that take but away the abstract ideas by which we sort individuals and rank them under common names and then the thought of anything essential to any of them instantly vanishes we have no notion of the one without the other which plainly shows their relation it is necessary for me to be as i am god and nature has made me so but there is nothing i have is essential to me an accident or disease may very much alter my colour or shape a fever or fall may take away my reason or memory or both and an apoplexy leave neither sense nor understanding no nor life other creatures of my shape may be made with more and better or fewer and worse faculties than i have and others may have reason and sense in a shape and body very different from mine none of these are essential to the one or the other or to any individual whatever till the mind refers it to some sort or species of things and then presently according to the abstract idea of that sort something is found essential let any one examine his own thoughts and he will find that as soon as he supposes or speaks of essential the consideration of some species or the complex idea signified by some general name comes into his mind and it is in reference to that that this or that quality is said to be essential so that if it be asked whether it be essential to me or any other particular corporeal being to have reason i say no no more than it is essential to this white thing i write on to have words in it but if that particular being be to be counted of the sort man and to have the name man given it then reason is essential to it supposing reason to be a part of the complex idea the name man stands for as it is essential to this thing i write on to contain words if i will give it the name treatise and rank it under that species so that essential and not essential relate only to our abstract ideas and the names annexed to them which amounts to no more than this that whatever particular thing has not in it those qualities which are contained in the abstract idea which any general term stands for cannot be ranked under that species nor be called by that name since that abstract idea is the very essence of that species the only essences perceived by us in individual substances are those qualities which entitle them to receive their names thus if the idea of body with some people be bare extension or space then solidity is not essential to body if others make the idea to which they give the name body to be solidity and extension then solidity is essential to body that therefore and that alone is considered as essential which makes a part of the complex idea the name of a sort stands for without which no particular thing can be reckoned of that sort nor be entitled to that name should there be found a parcel of matter that had all the other qualities that are in iron but wanted obedience to the loadstone and would neither be drawn by it nor receive direction from it would any one question whether it wanted anything essential it would be absurd to ask whether a thing really existing wanted anything essential to it or could it be demanded whether this made an essential or specific difference or no since we have no other measure of essential or specific but our abstract ideas and to talk of specific differences in nature without reference to general ideas in names is to talk unintelligibly for i would ask any one what is sufficient to make an essential difference in nature between any two particular beings without any regard had to some abstract idea which is looked upon as the essence and standard of a species all such patterns and standards being quite laid aside particular beings considered barely in themselves will be found to have all their qualities equally essential and everything in each individual will be essential to it or which is more nothing at all for though it may be reasonable to ask whether obeying the mag net be es sential to iron yet i think it is very improper and insignificant to ask whether it be essential to the particular parcel of matter i cut my pen with without considering it under the name iron or as being of a certain species and if as has been said our abstract ideas which have names annexed to them are the boundaries of species nothing can be essential but what is contained in those ideas even the real essences of individual substances imply potential sorts it is true i have often mentioned a real essence distinct in substances from those abstract ideas of them which i call their nominal essence by this real essence i mean that real constitution of anything which is the foundation of all those properties that are combined in and are constantly found to coexist with the nominal essence that particular constitution which everything has within itself without any relation to anything without it but essence even in this sense relates to a sort and supposes a species for being that real constitution on which the properties depend it necessarily supposes a sort of things properties belonging only to species and not to individuals vg supposing the nominal essence of gold to be a body of such a peculiar colour and weight with malleability and fusibility the real essence is that constitution of the parts of matter on which these qualities and their union depend and is also the foundation of its solubility in aqua regia and other properties accompanying that complex idea here are essences and properties but all upon supposition of a sort or general abstract idea which is considered as immutable but there is no individual parcel of matter to which any of these qualities are so annexed as to be essential to it or inseparable from it that which is essential belongs to it as a condition whereby it is of this or that sort but take away the consideration of its being ranked under the name of some abstract idea and then there is nothing necessary to it nothing inseparable from it indeed as to the real essences of substances we only suppose their being without precisely knowing what they are but that which annexes them still to the species is the nominal essence of which they are the supposed foundation and cause the nominal essence bounds the species for us the next thing to be considered is by which of those essences it is that substances are determined into sorts or species and that it is evident is by the nominal essence for it is that alone that the name which is the mark of the sort signifies it is impossible therefore that anything should determine the sorts of things which we rank under general names but that idea which that name is designed as a mark for which is that as has been shown which we call nominal essence why do we say this is a horse and that a mule this is an animal that an herb how comes any particular thing to be of this or that sort but because it has that nominal essence or which is all one agrees to that abstract idea that name is annexed to and i desire any one but to reflect on his own thoughts when he hears or speaks any of those or other names of substances to know what sort of essences they stand for the nature of species as formed by us and that the species of things to us are nothing but the ranking them under distinct names according to the complex ideas in us and not according to precise distinct real essences in them is plain from hencethat we find many of the individuals that are ranked into one sort called by one common name and so received as being of one species have yet qualities depending on their real constitutions as far different one from another as from others from which they are accounted to differ specifically this as it is easy to be observed by all who have to do with natural bodies so chemists especially are often by sad experience convinced of it when they sometimes in vain seek for the same qualities in one parcel of sulphur antimony or vitriol which they have found in others for though they are bodies of the same species having the same nominal essence under the same name yet do they often upon severe ways of examination betray qualities so different one from another as to frustrate the expectation and labour of very wary chemists but if things were distinguished into species according to their real essences it would be as impossible to find different properties in any two individual substances of the same species as it is to find different properties in two circles or two equilateral triangles that is properly the essence to us which determines every particular to this or that classis or which is the same thing to this or that general name and what can that be else but that abstract idea to which that name is annexed and so has in truth a reference not so much to the being of particular things as to their general denominations not the real essence or texture of parts which we know not nor indeed can we rank and sort things and consequently which is the end of sorting denominate them by their real essences because we know them not our faculties carry us no further towards the knowledge and distinction of substances than a collection of those sensible ideas which we observe in them which however made with the greatest diligence and exactness we are capable of yet is more remote from the true internal constitution from which those qualities flow than as i said a countrymans idea is from the inward contrivance of that famous clock at strasburg whereof he only sees the outward figure and motions there is not so contemptible a plant or animal that does not confound the most enlarged understanding though the familiar use of things about us take off our wonder yet it cures not our ignorance when we come to examine the stones we tread on or the iron we daily handle we presently find we know not their make and can give no reason of the different qualities we find in them it is evident the internal constitution whereon their properties depend is unknown to us for to go no further than the grossest and most obvious we can imagine amongst them what is that texture of parts that real essence that makes lead and antimony fusible wood and stones not what makes lead and iron malleable antimony and stones not and yet how infinitely these come short of the fine contrivances and inconceivable real essences of plants or animals every one knows the workmanship of the allwise and powerful god in the great fabric of the universe and every part thereof further exceeds the capacity and comprehension of the most inquisitive and intelligent man than the best contrivance of the most ingenious man doth the conceptions of the most ignorant of rational creatures therefore we in vain pretend to range things into sorts and dispose them into certain classes under names by their real essences that are so far from our discovery or comprehension a blind man may as soon sort things by their colours and he that has lost his smell as well distinguish a lily and a rose by their odours as by those internal constitutions which he knows not he that thinks he can distinguish sheep and goats by their real essences that are unknown to him may be pleased to try his skill in those species called cassiowary and querechinchio and by their internal real essences determine the boundaries of those species without knowing the complex idea of sensible qualities that each of those names stand for in the countries where those animals are to be found not the substantial form which we know less those therefore who have been taught that the several species of substances had their distinct internal substantial forms and that it was those forms which made the distinction of substances into their true species and genera were led yet further out of the way by having their minds set upon fruitless inquiries after substantial forms wholly unintelligible and whereof we have scarce so much as any obscure or confused conception in general that the nominal essence is that only whereby we distinguish species of substances further evident from our ideas of finite spirits and of god that our ranking and distinguishing natural substances into species consists in the nominal essences the mind makes and not in the real essences to be found in the things themselves is further evident from our ideas of spirits for the mind getting only by reflecting on its own operations those simple ideas which it attributes to spirits it hath or can have no other notion of spirit but by attributing all those operations it finds in itself to a sort of beings without consideration of matter and even the most advanced notion we have of god is but attributing the same simple ideas which we have got from reflection on what we find in ourselves and which we conceive to have more perfection in them than would be in their absence attributing i say those simple ideas to him in an unlimited degree thus having got from reflecting on ourselves the idea of existence knowledge power and pleasureeach of which we find it better to have than to want and the more we have of each the betterjoining all these together with infinity to each of them we have the complex idea of an eternal omniscient omnipotent infinitely wise and happy being and though we are told that there are different species of angels yet we know not how to frame distinct specific ideas of them not out of any conceit that the existence of more species than one of spirits is impossible but because having no more simple ideas nor being able to frame more applicable to such beings but only those few taken from ourselves and from the actions of our own minds in thinking and being delighted and moving several parts of our bodies we can no otherwise distinguish in our conceptions the several species of spirits one from another but by attributing those operations and powers we find in ourselves to them in a higher or lower degree and so have no very distinct specific ideas of spirits except only of god to whom we attribute both duration and all those other ideas with infinity to the other spirits with limitation nor as i humbly conceive do we between god and them in our ideas put any difference by any number of simple ideas which we have of one and not of the other but only that of infinity all the particular ideas of existence knowledge will power and motion c being ideas derived from the operations of our minds we attribute all of them to all sorts of spirits with the difference only of degrees to the utmost we can imagine even infinity when we would frame as well as we can an idea of the first being who yet it is certain is infinitely more remote in the real excellency of his nature from the highest and perfectest of all created beings than the greatest man nay purest seraph is from the most contemptible part of matter and consequently must infinitely exceed what our narrow understandings can conceive of him of finite spirits there are probably numberless species in a continuous series or gradation it is not impossible to conceive nor repugnant to reason that there may be many species of spirits as much separated and diversified one from another by distinct properties whereof we have no ideas as the species of sensible things are distinguished one from another by qualities which we know and observe in them that there should be more species of intelligent creatures above us than there are of sensible and material below us is probable to me from hence that in all the visible corporeal world we see no chasms or gaps all quite down from us the descent is by easy steps and a continued series of things that in each remove differ very little one from the other there are fishes that have wings and are not strangers to the airy region and there are some birds that are inhabitants of the water whose blood is cold as fishes and their flesh so like in taste that the scrupulous are allowed them on fishdays there are animals so near of kin both to birds and beasts that they are in the middle between both amphibious animals link the terrestrial and aquatic together seals live at land and sea and porpoises have the warm blood and entrails of a hog not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or seamen there are some brutes that seem to have as much knowledge and reason as some that are called men and the animal and vegetable kingdoms are so nearly joined that if you will take the lowest of one and the highest of the other there will scarce be perceived any great difference between them and so on till we come to the lowest and the most inorganical parts of matter we shall find everywhere that the several species are linked together and differ but in almost insensible degrees and when we consider the infinite power and wisdom of the maker we have reason to think that it is suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe and the great design and infinite goodness of the architect that the species of creatures should also by gentle degrees ascend upward from us toward his infinite perfection as we see they gradually descend from us downwards which if it be probable we have reason then to be persuaded that there are far more species of creatures above us than there are beneath we being in degrees of perfection much more remote from the infinite being of god than we are from the lowest state of being and that which approaches nearest to nothing and yet of all those distinct species for the reasons above said we have no clear distinct ideas the nominal essence that of the species as conceived by us proved from water and ice but to return to the species of corporeal substances if i should ask any one whether ice and water were two distinct species of things i doubt not but i should be answered in the affirmative and it cannot be denied but he that says they are two distinct species is in the right but if an englishman bred in jamaica who perhaps had never seen nor heard of ice coming into england in the winter find the water he put in his basin at night in a great part frozen in the morning and not knowing any peculiar name it had should call it hardened water i ask whether this would be a new species to him different from water and i think it would be answered here it would not be to him a new species no more than congealed jelly when it is cold is a distinct species from the same jelly fluid and warm or than liquid gold in the furnace is a distinct species from hard gold in the hands of a workman and if this be so it is plain that our distinct species are nothing but distinct complex ideas with distinct names annexed to them it is true every substance that exists has its peculiar constitution whereon depend those sensible qualities and powers we observe in it but the ranking of things into species which is nothing but sorting them under several titles is done by us according to the ideas that we have of them which though sufficient to distinguish them by names so that we may be able to discourse of them when we have them not present before us yet if we suppose it to be done by their real internal constitutions and that things existing are distinguished by nature into species by real essences according as we distinguish them into species by names we shall be liable to great mistakes difficulties in the supposition of a certain number of real essences to distinguish substantial beings into species according to the usual supposition that there are certain precise essences or forms of things whereby all the individuals existing are by nature distinguished into species these things are necessary a crude supposition first to be assured that nature in the production of things always designs them to partake of certain regulated established essences which are to be the models of all things to be produced this in that crude sense it is usually proposed would need some better explication before it can fully be assented to monstrous births secondly it would be necessary to know whether nature always attains that essence it designs in the production of things the irregular and monstrous births that in divers sorts of animals have been observed will always give us reason to doubt of one or both of these are monsters really a distinct species thirdly it ought to be determined whether those we call monsters be really a distinct species according to the scholastic notion of the word species since it is certain that everything that exists has its particular constitution and yet we find that some of these monstrous productions have few or none of those qualities which are supposed to result from and accompany the essence of that species from whence they derive their originals and to which by their descent they seem to belong men can have no ideas of real essences fourthly the real essences of those things which we distinguish into species and as so distinguished we name ought to be known ie we ought to have ideas of them but since we are ignorant in these four points the supposed real essences of things stand us not in stead for the distinguishing substances into species our nominal essences of substances not perfect collections of the properties that flow from their real essences fifthly the only imaginable help in this case would be that having framed perfect complex ideas of the properties of things flowing from their different real essences we should thereby distinguish them into species but neither can this be done for being ignorant of the real essence itself it is impossible to know all those properties that flow from it and are so annexed to it that any one of them being away we may certainly conclude that that essence is not there and so the thing is not of that species we can never know what is the precise number of properties depending on the real essence of gold any one of which failing the real essence of gold and consequently gold would not be there unless we knew the real essence of gold itself and by that determined that species by the word gold here i must be understood to design a particular piece of matter vg the last guinea that was coined for if it should stand here in its ordinary signification for that complex idea which i or any one else calls gold ie for the nominal essence of gold it would be jargon so hard is it to show the various meaning and imperfection of words when we have nothing else but words to do it by hence names independent of real essences by all which it is clear that our distinguishing substances into species by names is not at all founded on their real essences nor can we pretend to range and determine them exactly into species according to internal essential differences but stand for such a collection of simple substances as we have made the name stand for but since as has been remarked we have need of general words though we know not the real essences of things all we can do is to collect such a number of simple ideas as by examination we find to be united together in things existing and thereof to make one complex idea which though it be not the real essence of any substance that exists is yet the specific essence to which our name belongs and is convertible with it by which we may at least try the truth of these nominal essences for example there be that say that the essence of body is extension if it be so we can never mistake in putting the essence of anything for the thing itself let us then in discourse put extension for body and when we would say that body moves let us say that extension moves and see how ill it will look he that should say that one extension by impulse moves another extension would by the bare expression sufficiently show the absurdity of such a notion the essence of anything in respect of us is the whole complex idea comprehended and marked by that name and in substances besides the several distinct simple ideas that make them up the confused one of substance or of an unknown support and cause of their union is always a part and therefore the essence of body is not bare extension but an extended solid thing and so to say an extended solid thing moves or impels another is all one and as intelligible as to say body moves or impels likewise to say that a rational animal is capable of conversation is all one as to say a man but no one will say that rationality is capable of conversation because it makes not the whole essence to which we give the name man our abstract ideas are to us the measures of the species we make instance in that of man there are creatures in the world that have shapes like ours but are hairy and want language and reason there are naturals amongst us that have perfectly our shape but want reason and some of them language too there are creatures as it is said sit fides penes authorem but there appears no contradiction that there should be such that with language and reason and a shape in other things agreeing with ours have hairy tails others where the males have no beards and others where the females have if it be asked whether these be all men or no all of human species it is plain the question refers only to the nominal essence for those of them to whom the definition of the word man or the complex idea signified by the name agrees are men and the other not but if the inquiry be made concerning the supposed real essence and whether the internal constitution and frame of these several creatures be specifically different it is wholly impossible for us to answer no part of that going into our specific idea only we have reason to think that where the faculties or outward frame so much differs the internal constitution is not exactly the same but what difference in the real internal constitution makes a specific difference it is in vain to inquire whilst our measures of species be as they are only our abstract ideas which we know and not that internal constitution which makes no part of them shall the difference of hair only on the skin be a mark of a different internal specific constitution between a changeling and a drill when they agree in shape and want of reason and speech and shall not the want of reason and speech be a sign to us of different real constitutions and species between a changeling and a rea sonable man and so of the rest if we pretend that distinction of species or sorts is fixedly established by the real frame and secret constitutions of things species in animals not distinguished by generation nor let any one say that the power of propagation in animals by the mixture of male and female and in plants by seeds keeps the supposed real species distinct and entire for granting this to be true it would help us in the distinction of the species of things no further than the tribes of animals and vegetables what must we do for the rest but in those too it is not sufficient for if history lie not women have conceived by drills and what real species by that measure such a production will be in nature will be a new question and we have reason to think this is not impossible since mules and jumarts the one from the mixture of an ass and a mare the other from the mixture of a bull and a mare are so frequent in the world i once saw a creature that was the issue of a cat and a rat and had the plain marks of both about it wherein nature appeared to have followed the pattern of neither sort alone but to have jumbled them both together to which he that shall add the monstrous productions that are so frequently to be met with in nature will find it hard even in the race of animals to determine by the pedigree of what species every animals issue is and be at a loss about the real essence which he thinks certainly conveyed by generation and has alone a right to the specific name but further if the species of animals and plants are to be distinguished only by propagation must i go to the indies to see the sire and dam of the one and the plant from which the seed was gathered that produced the other to know whether this be a tiger or that tea not by substantial forms upon the whole matter it is evident that it is their own collections of sensible qualities that men make the essences of their several sorts of substances and that their real internal structures are not considered by the greatest part of men in the sorting them much less were any substantial forms ever thought on by any but those who have in this one part of the world learned the language of the schools and yet those ignorant men who pretend not any in sight into the real essences nor trouble themselves about substantial forms but are content with knowing things one from another by their sensible qualities are often better acquainted with their differences can more nicely distinguish them from their uses and better know what they expect from each than those learned quicksighted men who look so deep into them and talk so confidently of something more hidden and essential the specific essences that are commonly made by men but supposing that the real essences of substances were discoverable by those that would severely apply themselves to that inquiry yet we could not reasonably think that the ranking of things under general names was regulated by those internal real constitutions or anything else but their obvious appearances since languages in all countries have been established long before sciences so that they have not been philosophers or logicians or such who have troubled themselves about forms and essences that have made the general names that are in use amongst the several nations of men but those more or less comprehensive terms have for the most part in all languages received their birth and signification from ignorant and illiterate people who sorted and denominated things by those sensible qualities they found in them thereby to signify them when absent to others whether they had an occasion to mention a sort or a particular thing therefore very various and uncertain in the ideas of different men since then it is evident that we sort and name substances by their nominal and not by their real essences the next thing to be considered is how and by whom these essences come to be made as to the latter it is evident they are made by the mind and not by nature for were they natures workmanship they could not be so various and different in several men as experience tells us they are for if we will examine it we shall not find the nominal essence of any one species of substances in all men the same no not of that which of all others we are the most intimately acquainted with it could not possibly be that the abstract idea to which the name man is given should be different in several men if it were of natures making and that to one it should be animal rationale and to another animal implume bipes latis unguibus he that annexes the name to a complex idea made up of sense and spontaneous motion joined to a body of such a shape has thereby one essence of the species man and he that upon further examination adds rationality has another essence of the species he calls man by which means the same individual will be a true man to the one which is not so to the other i think there is scarce any one will allow this upright figure so well known to be the essential difference of the species man and yet how far men determine of the sorts of animals rather by their shape than descent is very visible since it has been more than once debated whether several human foetuses should be preserved or received to baptism or no only because of the difference of their outward configuration from the ordinary make of children without knowing whether they were not as capable of reason as infants cast in another mould some whereof though of an approved shape are never capable of as much appearance of reason all their lives as is to be found in an ape or an elephant and never give any signs of being acted by a rational soul whereby it is evident that the outward figure which only was found wanting and not the faculty of reason which nobody could know would be wanting in its due season was made essential to the human species the learned divine and lawyer must on such occasions renounce his sacred definition of animal rationale and substitute some other essence of the human species monsieur menage furnishes us with an example worth the taking notice of on this occasion when the abbot of saint martin says he was born he had so little of the figure of a man that it bespake him rather a monster it was for some time under deliberation whether he should be baptized or no however he was baptized and declared a man provisionally till time should show what he would prove nature had moulded him so untowardly that he was called all his life the abbot malotru ie illshaped he was of caen menagiana this child we see was very near being excluded out of the species of man barely by his shape he escaped very narrowly as he was and it is certain a figure a little more oddly turned had cast him and he had been executed as a thing not to be allowed to pass for a man and yet there can be no reason given why if the lineaments of his face had been a little altered a rational soul could not have been lodged in him why a visage somewhat longer or a nose flatter or a wider mouth could not have consisted as well as the rest of his ill figure with such a soul such parts as made him disfigured as he was capable to be a dignitary in the church nominal essences of particular substances are undetermined by nature and therefore various as men vary wherein then would i gladly know consist the precise and unmovable boundaries of that species it is plain if we examine there is no such thing made by nature and established by her amongst men the real essence of that or any other sort of substances it is evident we know not and therefore are so undetermined in our nominal essences which we make ourselves that if several men were to be asked concerning some oddly shaped foetus as soon as born whether it were a man or no it is past doubt one should meet with different answers which could not happen if the nominal essences whereby we limit and distinguish the species of substances were not made by man with some liberty but were exactly copied from precise boundaries set by nature whereby it distinguished all substances into certain species who would undertake to resolve what species that monster was of which is mentioned by licetus bk i c with a mans head and hogs body or those other which to the bodies of men had the heads of beasts as dogs horses c if any of these creatures had lived and could have spoke it would have increased the difficulty had the upper part to the middle been of human shape and all below swine had it been murder to destroy it or must the bishop have been consulted whether it were man enough to be admitted to the font or no as i have been told it happened in france some years since in somewhat a like case so uncertain are the boundaries of species of animals to us who have no other measures than the complex ideas of our own collecting and so far are we from certainly knowing what a man is though perhaps it will be judged great ignorance to make any doubt about it and yet i think i may say that the certain boundaries of that species are so far from being determined and the precise number of simple ideas which make the nominal essence so far from being settled and perfectly known that very material doubts may still arise about it and i imagine none of the definitions of the word man which we yet have nor descriptions of that sort of animal are so perfect and exact as to satisfy a considerate inquisitive person much less to obtain a general consent and to be that which men would everywhere stick by in the decision of cases and determining of life and death baptism or no baptism in productions that might happen but not so arbitrary as mixed modes but though these nominal essences of substances are made by the mind they are not yet made so arbitrarily as those of mixed modes to the making of any nominal essence it is necessary first that the ideas whereof it consists have such a union as to make but one idea how compounded soever secondly that the particular ideas so united be exactly the same neither more nor less for if two abstract complex ideas differ either in number or sorts of their component parts they make two different and not one and the same essence in the first of these the mind in making its complex ideas of substances only follows nature and puts none together which are not supposed to have a union in nature nobody joins the voice of a sheep with the shape of a horse nor the colour of lead with the weight and fixedness of gold to be the complex ideas of any real substances unless he has a mind to fill his head with chimeras and his discourse with unintelligible words men observing certain qualities always joined and existing together therein copied nature and of ideas so united made their complex ones of substances for though men may make what complex ideas they please and give what names to them they will yet if they will be understood when they speak of things really existing they must in some degree conform their ideas to the things they would speak of or else mens language will be like that of babel and every mans words being intelligible only to himself would no longer serve to conversation and the ordinary affairs of life if the ideas they stand for be not some way answering the common appearances and agreement of substances as they really exist our nominal essences of substances usually consist of a few obvious qualities observed in things secondly though the mind of man in making its complex ideas of substances never puts any together that do not really or are not supposed to coexist and so it truly borrows that union from nature yet the number it combines depends upon the various care industry or fancy of him that makes it men generally content themselves with some few sensible obvious qualities and often if not always leave out others as material and as firmly united as those that they take of sensible substances there are two sorts one of organized bodies which are propagated by seed and in these the shape is that which to us is the leading quality and most characteristical part that determines the species and therefore in vegetables and animals an extended solid substance of such a certain figure usually serves the turn for however some men seem to prize their definition of animal rationale yet should there a creature be found that had language and reason but partaked not of the usual shape of a man i believe it would hardly pass for a man how much soever it were animal rationale and if balaams ass had all his life discoursed as rationally as he did once with his master i doubt yet whether any one would have thought him worthy the name man or allowed him to be of the same species with himself as in vegetables and animals it is the shape so in most other bodies not propagated by seed it is the colour we must fix on and are most led by thus where we find the colour of gold we are apt to imagine all the other qualities comprehended in our complex idea to be there also and we commonly take these two obvious qualities viz shape and colour for so presumptive ideas of several species that in a good picture we readily say this is a lion and that a rose this is a gold and that a silver goblet only by the different figures and colours represented to the eye by the pencil yet imperfect as they thus are they serve for com mon converse but though this serves well enough for gross and confused conceptions and inaccurate ways of talking and thinking yet men are far enough from having agreed on the precise number of simple ideas or qualities belonging to any sort of things signified by its name nor is it a wonder since it requires much time pains and skill strict inquiry and long examination to find out what and how many those simple ideas are which are constantly and inseparably united in nature and are always to be found together in the same subject most men wanting either time inclination or industry enough for this even to some tolerable degree content themselves with some few obvious and outward appearances of things thereby readily to distinguish and sort them for the common affairs of life and so without further examination give them names or take up the names already in use which though in common conversation they pass well enough for the signs of some few obvious qualities coexisting are yet far enough from comprehending in a settled signification a precise number of simple ideas much less all those which are united in nature he that shall consider after so much stir about genus and species and such a deal of talk of specific differences how few words we have yet settled definitions of may with reason imagine that those forms which there hath been so much noise made about are only chimeras which give us no light into the specific natures of things and he that shall consider how far the names of substances are from having significations wherein all who use them do agree will have reason to conclude that though the nominal essences of substances are all supposed to be copied from nature yet they are all or most of them very imperfect since the composition of those complex ideas are in several men very different and therefore that these boundaries of species are as men and not as nature makes them if at least there are in nature any such prefixed bounds it is true that many particular substances are so made by nature that they have agreement and likeness one with another and so afford a foundation of being ranked into sorts but the sorting of things by us or the making of determinate species being in order to naming and comprehending them under general terms i cannot see how it can be properly said that nature sets the boundaries of the species of things or if it be so our boundaries of species are not exactly conformable to those in nature for we having need of general names for present use stay not for a perfect discovery of all those qualities which would best show us their most material differences and agreements but we ourselves divide them by certain obvious appearances into species that we may the easier under general names communicate our thoughts about them for having no other knowledge of any substance but of the simple ideas that are united in it and observing several particular things to agree with others in several of those simple ideas we make that collection our specific idea and give it a general name that in recording our thoughts and in our discourse with others we may in one short word designate all the individuals that agree in that complex idea without enumerating the simple ideas that make it up and so not waste our time and breath in tedious descriptions which we see they are fain to do who would discourse of any new sort of things they have not yet a name for essences of species under the same name very different in different minds but however these species of substances pass well enough in ordinary conversation it is plain that this complex idea wherein they observe several individuals to agree is by different men made very differently by some more and others less accurately in some this complex idea contains a greater and in others a smaller number of qualities and so is apparently such as the mind makes it the yellow shining colour makes gold to children others add weight malleableness and fusibility and others yet other qualities which they find joined with that yellow colour as constantly as its weight and fusibility for in all these and the like qualities one has as good a right to be put into the complex idea of that substance wherein they are all joined as another and therefore different men leaving out or putting in several simple ideas which others do not according to their various examination skill or observation of that subject have different essences of gold which must therefore be of their own and not of natures making the more general our ideas of substances are the more incomplete and partial they are if the number of simple ideas that make the nominal essence of the lowest species or first sorting of individuals depends on the mind of man variously collecting them it is much more evident that they do so in the more comprehensive classes which by the masters of logic are called genera these are complex ideas designedly imperfect and it is visible at first sight that several of those qualities that are to be found in the things themselves are purposely left out of generical ideas for as the mind to make general ideas comprehending several particulars leaves out those of time and place and such other that make them incommunicable to more than one individual so to make other yet more general ideas that may comprehend different sorts it leaves out those qualities that distinguish them and puts into its new collection only such ideas as are common to several sorts the same convenience that made men express several parcels of yellow matter coming from guinea and peru under one name sets them also upon making of one name that may comprehend both gold and silver and some other bodies of different sorts this is done by leaving out those qualities which are peculiar to each sort and retaining a complex idea made up of those that are common to them all to which the name metal being annexed there is a genus constituted the essence whereof being that abstract idea containing only malleableness and fusibility with certain degrees of weight and fixedness wherein some bodies of several kinds agree leaves out the colour and other qualities peculiar to gold and silver and the other sorts comprehended under the name metal whereby it is plain that men follow not exactly the patterns set them by nature when they make their general ideas of substances since there is no body to be found which has barely malleableness and fusibility in it without other qualities as inseparable as those but men in making their general ideas seeking more the convenience of language and quick dispatch by short and comprehensive signs than the true and precise nature of things as they exist have in the framing their abstract ideas chiefly pursued that end which was to be furnished with store of general and variously comprehensive names so that in this whole business of genera and species the genus or more comprehensive is but a partial conception of what is in the species and the species but a partial idea of what is to be found in each individual if therefore any one will think that a man and a horse and an animal and a plant c are distinguished by real essences made by nature he must think nature to be very liberal of these real essences making one for body another for an animal and another for a horse and all these essences liberally bestowed upon bucephalus but if we would rightly consider what is done in all these genera and species or sorts we should find that there is no new thing made but only more or less comprehensive signs whereby we may be enabled to express in a few syllables great numbers of particular things as they agree in more or less general conceptions which we have framed to that purpose in all which we may observe that the more general term is always the name of a less complex idea and that each genus is but a partial conception of the species comprehended under it so that if these abstract general ideas be thought to be complete it can only be in respect of a certain established relation between them and certain names which are made use of to signify them and not in respect of anything existing as made by nature this all accommodated to the end of speech this is adjusted to the true end of speech which is to be the easiest and shortest way of communicating our notions for thus he that would discourse of things as they agreed in the complex idea of extension and solidity needed but use the word body to denote all such he that to these would join others signified by the words life sense and spontaneous motion needed but use the word animal to signify all which partaked of those ideas and he that had made a complex idea of a body with life sense and motion with the faculty of reasoning and a certain shape joined to it needed but use the short monosyllable man to express all particulars that correspond to that complex idea this is the proper business of genus and species and this men do without any consideration of real essences or substantial forms which come not within the reach of our knowledge when we think of those things nor within the signification of our words when we discourse with others instance in cassowaries were i to talk with any one of a sort of birds i lately saw in st jamess park about three or four feet high with a covering of something between feathers and hair of a dark brown colour without wings but in the place thereof two or three little branches coming down like sprigs of spanish broom long great legs with feet only of three claws and without a tail i must make this description of it and so may make others understand me but when i am told that the name of it is cassuaris i may then use that word to stand in discourse for all my complex idea mentioned in that description though by that word which is now become a specific name i know no more of the real essence or constitution of that sort of animals than i did before and knew probably as much of the nature of that species of birds before i learned the name as many englishmen do of swans or herons which are specific names very well known of sorts of birds common in england men determine the sorts of substances which may be sorted variously from what has been said it is evident that men make sorts of things for it being different essences alone that make different species it is plain that they who make those abstract ideas which are the nominal essences do thereby make the species or sort should there be a body found having all the other qualities of gold except malleableness it would no doubt be made a question whether it were gold or not ie whether it were of that species this could be determined only by that abstract idea to which every one annexed the name gold so that it would be true gold to him and belong to that species who included not malleableness in his nominal essence signified by the sound gold and on the other side it would not be true gold or of that species to him who included malleableness in his specific idea and who i pray is it that makes these diverse species even under one and the same name but men that make two different abstract ideas consisting not exactly of the same collection of qualities nor is it a mere supposition to imagine that a body may exist wherein the other obvious qualities of gold may be without malleableness since it is certain that gold itself will be sometimes so eager as artists call it that it will as little endure the hammer as glass itself what we have said of the putting in or leaving out of malleableness in the complex idea the name gold is by any one annexed to may be said of its peculiar weight fixedness and several other the like qualities for whatever is left out or put in it is still the complex idea to which that name is annexed that makes the species and as any particular parcel of matter answers that idea so the name of the sort belongs truly to it and it is of that species and thus anything is true gold perfect metal all which determination of the species it is plain depends on the understanding of man making this or that complex idea nature makes the similitudes of substances this then in short is the case nature makes many particular things which do agree one with another in many sensible qualities and probably too in their internal frame and constitution but it is not this real essence that distinguishes them into species it is men who taking occasion from the qualities they find united in them and wherein they observe often several individuals to agree range them into sorts in order to their naming for the convenience of comprehensive signs under which individuals according to their conformity to this or that abstract idea come to be ranked as under ensigns so that this is of the blue that the red regiment this is a man that a drill and in this i think consists the whole business of genus and species the manner of sorting particular beings the work of fallible men though nature makes things alike i do not deny but nature in the constant production of particular beings makes them not always new and various but very much alike and of kin one to another but i think it nevertheless true that the boundaries of the species whereby men sort them are made by men since the essences of the species distinguished by different names are as has been proved of mans making and seldom adequate to the internal nature of the things they are taken from so that we may truly say such a manner of sorting of things is the workmanship of men each abstract idea with a name to it makes a nominal essence one thing i doubt not but will seem very strange in this doctrine which is that from what has been said it will follow that each abstract idea with a name to it makes a distinct species but who can help it if truth will have it so for so it must remain till somebody can show us the species of things limited and distinguished by something else and let us see that general terms signify not our abstract ideas but something different from them i would fain know why a shock and a hound are not as distinct species as a spaniel and an elephant we have no other idea of the different essence of an elephant and a spaniel than we have of the different essence of a shock and a hound all the essential difference whereby we know and distinguish them one from another consisting only in the different collection of simple ideas to which we have given those different names how genera and species are related to naming how much the making of species and genera is in order to general names and how much general names are necessary if not to the being yet at least to the completing of a species and making it pass for such will appear besides what has been said above concerning ice and water in a very familiar example a silent and a striking watch are but one species to those who have but one name for them but he that has the name watch for one and clock for the other and distinct complex ideas to which those names belong to him they are different species it will be said perhaps that the inward contrivance and constitution is different between these two which the watchmaker has a clear idea of and yet it is plain they are but one species to him when he has but one name for them for what is sufficient in the inward contrivance to make a new species there are some watches that are made with four wheels others with five is this a specific difference to the workman some have strings and physies and others none some have the balance loose and others regulated by a spiral spring and others by hogs bristles are any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to the workman that knows each of these and several other different contrivances in the internal constitutions of watches it is certain each of these hath a real difference from the rest but whether it be an essential a specific difference or no relates only to the complex idea to which the name watch is given as long as they all agree in the idea which that name stands for and that name does not as a generical name comprehend different species under it they are not essentially nor specifically different but if any one will make minuter divisions from differences that he knows in the internal frame of watches and to such precise complex ideas give names that shall prevail they will then be new species to them who have those ideas with names to them and can by those differences distinguish watches into these several sorts and then watch will be a generical name but yet they would be no distinct species to men ignorant of clockwork and the inward contrivances of watches who had no other idea but the outward shape and bulk with the marking of the hours by the hand for to them all those other names would be but synonymous terms for the same idea and signify no more nor no other thing but a watch just thus i think it is in natural things nobody will doubt that the wheels or springs if i may so say within are different in a rational man and a changeling no more than that there is a difference in the frame between a drill and a changeling but whether one or both these differences be essential or specifical is only to be known to us by their agreement or disagreement with the complex idea that the name man stands for for by that alone can it be determined whether one or both or neither of those be a man species of artificial things less confused than natural from what has been before said we may see the reason why in the species of artificial things there is generally less confusion and uncertainty than in natural because an artificial thing being a production of man which the artificer designed and therefore well knows the idea of the name of it is supposed to stand for no other idea nor to import any other essence than what is certainly to be known and easy enough to be apprehended for the idea or essence of the several sorts of artificial things consisting for the most part in nothing but the determinate figure of sensible parts and sometimes motion depending thereon which the artificer fashions in matter such as he finds for his turn it is not beyond the reach of our faculties to attain a certain idea thereof and so settle the signification of the names whereby the species of artificial things are distinguished with less doubt obscurity and equivocation than we can in things natural whose differences and operations depend upon contrivances beyond the reach of our discoveries artificial things of distinct species i must be excused here if i think artificial things are of distinct species as well as natural since i find they are as plainly and orderly ranked into sorts by different abstract ideas with general names annexed to them as distinct one from another as those of natural substances for why should we not think a watch and pistol as distinct species one from another as a horse and a dog they being expressed in our minds by distinct ideas and to others by distinct appellations substances alone of all our several sorts of ideas have proper names this is further to be observed concerning substances that they alone of all our several sorts of ideas have particular or proper names whereby one only particular thing is signified because in simple ideas modes and relations it seldom happens that men have occasion to mention often this or that particular when it is absent besides the greatest part of mixed modes being actions which perish in their birth are not capable of a lasting duration as substances which are the actors and wherein the simple ideas that make up the complex ideas designed by the name have a lasting union difficult to lead another by words into the thoughts of things stripped of those abstract ideas we give them i must beg pardon of my reader for having dwelt so long upon this subject and perhaps with some obscurity but i desire it may be considered how difficult it is to lead another by words into the thoughts of things stripped of those specifical differences we give them which things if i name not i say nothing and if i do name them i thereby rank them into some sort or other and suggest to the mind the usual abstract idea of that species and so cross my purpose for to talk of a man and to lay by at the same time the ordinary signification of the name man which is our complex idea usually annexed to it and bid the reader consider man as he is in himself and as he is really distinguished from others in his internal constitution or real essence that is by something he knows not what looks like trifling and yet thus one must do who would speak of the supposed real essences and species of things as thought to be made by nature if it be but only to make it understood that there is no such thing signified by the general names which substances are called by but because it is difficult by known familiar names to do this give me leave to endeavour by an example to make the different consideration the mind has of specific names and ideas a little more clear and to show how the complex ideas of modes are referred sometimes to archetypes in the minds of other intelligent beings or which is the same to the signification annexed by others to their received names and sometimes to no archetypes at all give me leave also to show how the mind always refers its ideas of substances either to the substances themselves or to the signification of their names as to the archetypes and also to make plain the nature of species or sorting of things as apprehended and made use of by us and of the essences belonging to those species which is perhaps of more moment to discover the extent and certainty of our knowledge than we at first imagine instances of mixed modes named kinneah and niouph let us suppose adam in the state of a grown man with a good understanding but in a strange country with all things new and unknown about him and no other faculties to attain the knowledge of them but what one of this age has now he observes lamech more melancholy than usual and imagines it to be from a suspicion he has of his wife adah whom he most ardently loved that she had too much kindness for another man adam discourses these his thoughts to eve and desires her to take care that adah commit not folly and in these discourses with eve he makes use of these two new words kinneah and niouph in time adams mistake appears for he finds lamechs trouble proceeded from having killed a man but yet the two names kinneah and niouph the one standing for suspicion in a husband of his wifes disloyalty to him and the other for the act of committing disloyalty lost not their distinct significations it is plain then that here were two distinct complex ideas of mixed modes with names to them two distinct species of actions essentially different i ask wherein consisted the essences of these two distinct species of actions and it is plain it consisted in a precise combination of simple ideas different in one from the other i ask whether the complex idea in adams mind which he called kinneah were adequate or not and it is plain it was for it being a combination of simple ideas which he without any regard to any archetype without respect to anything as a pattern voluntarily put together abstracted and gave the name kinneah to to express in short to others by that one sound all the simple ideas contained and united in that complex one it must necessarily follow that it was an adequate idea his own choice having made that combination it had all in it he intended it should and so could not but be perfect could not but be adequate it being referred to no other archetype which it was supposed to represent these words kinneah and niouph by degrees grew into common use and then the case was somewhat altered adams children had the same faculties and thereby the same power that he had to make what complex ideas of mixed modes they pleased in their own minds to abstract them and make what sounds they pleased the signs of them but the use of names being to make our ideas within us known to others that cannot be done but when the same sign stands for the same idea in two who would communicate their thoughts and discourse together those therefore of adams children that found these two words kinneah and niouph in familiar use could not take them for insignificant sounds but must needs conclude they stood for something for certain ideas abstract ideas they being general names which abstract ideas were the essences of the species distinguished by those names if therefore they would use these words as names of species already established and agreed on they were obliged to conform the ideas in their minds signified by these names to the ideas that they stood for in other mens minds as to their patterns and archetypes and then indeed their ideas of these complex modes were liable to be inadequate as being very apt especially those that consisted of combinations of many simple ideas not to be exactly conformable to the ideas in other mens minds using the same names though for this there be usually a remedy at hand which is to ask the meaning of any word we understand not of him that uses it it being as impossible to know certainly what the words jealousy and adultery stand for in another mans mind with whom i would discourse about them as it was impossible in the beginning of language to know what kinneah and niouph stood for in another mans mind without explication they being voluntary signs in every one instances of a species of substance named zahab let us now also consider after the same manner the names of substances in their first application one of adams children roving in the mountains lights on a glittering substance which pleases his eye home he carries it to adam who upon consideration of it finds it to be hard to have a bright yellow colour and an exceeding great weight these perhaps at first are all the qualities he takes notice of in it and abstracting this complex idea consisting of a substance having that peculiar bright yellowness and a weight very great in proportion to its bulk he gives the name zahab to denominate and mark all substances that have these sensible qualities in them it is evident now that in this case adam acts quite differently from what he did before in forming those ideas of mixed modes to which he gave the names kinneah and niouph for there he put ideas together only by his own imagination not taken from the existence of anything and to them he gave names to denominate all things that should happen to agree to those his abstract ideas without considering whether any such thing did exist or not the standard there was of his own making but in the forming his idea of this new substance he takes the quite contrary course here he has a standard made by nature and therefore being to represent that to himself by the idea he has of it even when it is absent he puts in no simple idea into his complex one but what he has the perception of from the thing itself he takes care that his idea be conformable to this archetype and intends the name should stand for an idea so conformable this piece of matter thus denominated zahab by adam being quite different from any he had seen before nobody i think will deny to be a distinct species and to have its peculiar essence and that the name zahab is the mark of the species and a name belonging to all things partaking in that essence but here it is plain the essence adam made the name zahab stand for was nothing but a body hard shining yellow and very heavy but the inquisitive mind of man not content with the knowledge of these as i may say superficial qualities puts adam upon further examination of this matter he therefore knocks and beats it with flints to see what was discoverable in the inside he finds it yield to blows but not easily separate into pieces he finds it will bend without breaking is not now ductility to be added to his former idea and made part of the essence of the species that name zahab stands for further trials discover fusibility and fixedness are not they also by the same reason that any of the others were to be put into the complex idea signified by the name zahab if not what reason will there be shown more for the one than the other if these must then all the other properties which any further trials shall discover in this matter ought by the same reason to make a part of the ingredients of the complex idea which the name zahab stands for and so be the essence of the species marked by that name which properties because they are endless it is plain that the idea made after this fashion by this archetype will be always inadequate the abstract ideas of substances always imperfect and therefore various but this is not all it would also follow that the names of substances would not only have as in truth they have but would also be supposed to have different significations as used by different men which would very much cumber the use of language for if every distinct quality that were discovered in any matter by any one were supposed to make a necessary part of the complex idea signified by the common name given to it it must follow that men must suppose the same word to signify different things in different men since they cannot doubt but different men may have discovered several qualities in substances of the same denomination which others know nothing of therefore to fix their nominal species a real essense is supposed to avoid this therefore they have supposed a real essence belonging to every species from which these properties all flow and would have their name of the species stand for that but they not having any idea of that real essence in substances and their words signifying nothing but the ideas they have that which is done by this attempt is only to put the name or sound in the place and stead of the thing having that real essence without knowing what the real essence is and this is that which men do when they speak of species of things as supposing them made by nature and distinguished by real essences which supposition is of no use for let us consider when we affirm that all gold is fixed either it means that fixedness is a part of the definition ie part of the nominal essence the word gold stands for and so this affirmation all gold is fixed contains nothing but the signification of the term gold or else it means that fixedness not being a part of the definition of the gold is a property of that substance itself in which case it is plain that the word gold stands in the place of a substance having the real essence of a species of things made by nature in which way of substitution it has so confused and uncertain a signification that though this propositiongold is fixedbe in that sense an affirmation of something real yet it is a truth will always fail us in its particular application and so is of no real use or certainty for let it be ever so true that all gold ie all that has the real essence of gold is fixed what serves this for whilst we know not in this sense what is or is not gold for if we know not the real essence of gold it is impossible we should know what parcel of matter has that essence and so whether it be true gold or no conclusion to conclude what liberty adam had at first to make any complex ideas of mixed modes by no other pattern but by his own thoughts the same have all men ever since had and the same necessity of conforming his ideas of substances to things without him as to archetypes made by nature that adam was under if he would not wilfully impose upon himself the same are all men ever since under too the same liberty also that adam had of affixing any new name to any idea the same has any one still especially the beginners of languages if we can imagine any such but only with this difference that in places where men in society have already established a language amongst them the significations of words are very warily and sparingly to be altered because men being furnished already with names for their ideas and common use having appropriated known names to certain ideas an affected misapplication of them cannot but be very ridiculous he that hath new notions will perhaps venture sometimes on the coining of new terms to express them but men think it a boldness and it is uncertain whether common use will ever make them pass for current but in communication with others it is necessary that we conform the ideas we make the vulgar words of any language stand for to their known proper significations which i have explained at large already or else to make known that new signification we apply them to ii of particles particles connect parts or whole sentences together besides words which are names of ideas in the mind there are a great many others that are made use of to signify the connexion that the mind gives to ideas or to propositions one with another the mind in communicating its thoughts to others does not only need signs of the ideas it has then before it but others also to show or intimate some particular action of its own at that time relating to those ideas this it does several ways as is and is not are the general marks of the mind affirming or denying but besides affirmation or negation without which there is in words no truth or falsehood the mind does in declaring its sentiments to others connect not only the parts of propositions but whole sentences one to another with their several relations and dependencies to make a coherent discourse in right use of particles consists the art of wellspeaking the words whereby it signifies what connexion it gives to the several affirmations and negations that it unites in one continued reasoning or narration are generally called particles and it is in the right use of these that more particularly consists the clearness and beauty of a good style to think well it is not enough that a man has ideas clear and distinct in his thoughts nor that he observes the agreement or disagreement of some of them but he must think in train and observe the dependence of his thoughts and reasonings upon one another and to express well such methodical and rational thoughts he must have words to show what connexion restriction distinction opposition emphasis c he gives to each respective part of his discourse to mistake in any of these is to puzzle instead of informing his hearer and therefore it is that those words which are not truly by themselves the names of any ideas are of such constant and indispensable use in language and do much contribute to mens well expressing themselves they show what relation the mind gives to its own thoughts this part of grammar has been perhaps as much neglected as some others overdiligently cultivated it is easy for men to write one after another of cases and genders moods and tenses gerunds and supines in these and the like there has been great diligence used and particles themselves in some languages have been with great show of exactness ranked into their several orders but though prepositions and conjunctions c are names well known in grammar and the particles contained under them carefully ranked into their distinct subdivisions yet he who would show the right use of particles and what significancy and force they have must take a little more pains enter into his own thoughts and observe nicely the several postures of his mind in discoursing they are all marks of some action or intimation of the mind neither is it enough for the explaining of these words to render them as is usual in dictionaries by words of another tongue which come nearest to their signification for what is meant by them is commonly as hard to be understood in one as another language they are all marks of some action or intimation of the mind and therefore to understand them rightly the several views postures stands turns limitations and exceptions and several other thoughts of the mind for which we have either none or very deficient names are diligently to be studied of these there is a great variety much exceeding the number of particles that most languages have to express them by and therefore it is not to be wondered that most of these particles have divers and sometimes almost opposite significations in the hebrew tongue there is a particle consisting of but one single letter of which there are reckoned up as i remember seventy i am sure above fifty several significations instance in but but is a particle none more familiar in our language and he that says it is a discretive conjunction and that it answers to sed latin or mais in french thinks he has sufficiently explained it but yet it seems to me to intimate several relations the mind gives to the several propositions or parts of them which it joins by this monosyllable first but to say no more here it intimates a stop of the mind in the course it was going before it came quite to the end of it secondly i saw but two plants here it shows that the mind limits the sense to what is expressed with a negation of all other thirdly you pray but it is not that god would bring you to the true religion fourthly but that he would confirm you in your own the first of these buts intimates a supposition in the mind of something otherwise than it should be the latter shows that the mind makes a direct opposition between that and what goes before it fifthly all animals have sense but a dog is an animal here it signifies little more but that the latter proposition is joined to the former as the minor of a syllogism this matter of the use of particles but lightly touched here to these i doubt not might be added a great many other significations of this particle if it were my business to examine it in its full latitude and consider it in all the places it is to be found which if one should do i doubt whether in all those manners it is made use of it would deserve the title of discretive which grammarians give to it but i intend not here a full explication of this sort of signs the instances i have given in this one may give occasion to reflect on their use and force in language and lead us into the contemplation of several actions of our minds in discoursing which it has found a way to intimate to others by these particles some whereof constantly and others in certain constructions have the sense of a whole sentence contained in them iii of abstract and concrete terms abstract terms not predictable one of another and why the ordinary words of language and our common use of them would have given us light into the nature of our ideas if they had been but considered with attention the mind as has been shown has a power to abstract its ideas and so they become essences general essences whereby the sorts of things are distinguished now each abstract idea being distinct so that of any two the one can never be the other the mind will by its intuitive knowledge perceive their difference and therefore in propositions no two whole ideas can ever be affirmed one of another this we see in the common use of language which permits not any two abstract words or names of abstract ideas to be affirmed one of another for how near of kin soever they may seem to be and how certain soever it is that man is an animal or rational or white yet every one at first hearing perceives the falsehood of these propositions humanity is animality or rationality or whiteness and this is as evident as any of the most allowed maxims all our affirmations then are only in concrete which is the affirming not one abstract idea to be another but one abstract idea to be joined to another which abstract ideas in substances may be of any sort in all the rest are little else but of relations and in substances the most frequent are of powers vg a man is white signifies that the thing that has the essence of a man has also in it the essence of whiteness which is nothing but a power to produce the idea of whiteness in one whose eyes can discover ordinary objects or a man is rational signifies that the same thing that hath the essence of a man hath also in it the essence of rationality ie a power of reasoning they show the difference of our ideas this distinction of names shows us also the difference of our ideas for if we observe them we shall find that our simple ideas have all abstract as well as concrete names the one whereof is to speak the language of grammarians a substantive the other an adjective as whiteness white sweetness sweet the like also holds in our ideas of modes and relations as justice just equality equal only with this difference that some of the concrete names of relations amongst men chiefly are substantives as paternitas pater whereof it were easy to render a reason but as to our ideas of substances we have very few or no abstract names at all for though the schools have introduced animalitas humanitas corporietas and some others yet they hold no proportion with that infinite number of names of substances to which they never were ridiculous enough to attempt the coining of abstract ones and those few that the schools forged and put into the mouths of their scholars could never yet get admittance into common use or obtain the license of public approbation which seems to me at least to intimate the confession of all mankind that they have no ideas of the real essences of substances since they have not names for such ideas which no doubt they would have had had not their consciousness to themselves of their ignorance of them kept them from so idle an attempt and therefore though they had ideas enough to distinguish gold from a stone and metal from wood yet they but timorously ventured on such terms as aurietas and saxietas metallietas and lignietas or the like names which should pretend to signify the real essences of those substances whereof they knew they had no ideas and indeed it was only the doctrine of substantial forms and the confidence of mistaken pretenders to a knowledge that they had not which first coined and then introduced animalitas and humanitas and the like which yet went very little further than their own schools and could never get to be current amongst understanding men indeed humanitas was a word in familiar use amongst the romans but in a far different sense and stood not for the abstract essence of any substance but was the abstracted name of a mode and its concrete humanus not homo of the imperfection of words words are used for recording and communicating our thoughts from what has been said in the foregoing chapters it is easy to perceive what imperfection there is in language and how the very nature of words makes it almost unavoidable for many of them to be doubtful and uncertain in their significations to examine the perfection or imperfection of words it is necessary first to consider their use and end for as they are more or less fitted to attain that so they are more or less perfect we have in the former part of this discourse often upon occasion mentioned a double use of words first one for the recording of our own thoughts secondly the other for the communicating of our thoughts to others any words will serve for recording as to the first of these for the recording our own thoughts for the help of our own memories whereby as it were we talk to ourselves any words will serve the turn for since sounds are voluntary and indifferent signs of any ideas a man may use what words he pleases to signify his own ideas to himself and there will be no imperfection in them if he constantly use the same sign for the same idea for then he cannot fail of having his meaning understood wherein consists the right use and perfection of language communication by words either for civil or philosophical purposes secondly as to communication by words that too has a double use i civil ii philosophical first by their civil use i mean such a communication of thoughts and ideas by words as may serve for the upholding common conversation and commerce about the ordinary affairs and conveniences of civil life in the societies of men one amongst another secondly by the philosophical use of words i mean such a use of them as may serve to convey the precise notions of things and to express in general propositions certain and undoubted truths which the mind may rest upon and be satisfied with in its search after true knowledge these two uses are very distinct and a great deal less exactness will serve in the one than in the other as we shall see in what follows the imperfection of words is the doubtfulness or ambiguity of their signification which is caused by the sort of ideas they stand for the chief end of language in communication being to be understood words serve not well for that end neither in civil nor philosophical discourse when any word does not excite in the hearer the same idea which it stands for in the mind of the speaker now since sounds have no natural connexion with our ideas but have all their signification from the arbitrary imposition of men the doubtfulness and uncertainty of their signification which is the imperfection we here are speaking of has its cause more in the ideas they stand for than in any incapacity there is in one sound more than in another to signify any idea for in that regard they are all equally perfect that then which makes doubtfulness and uncertainty in the signification of some more than other words is the difference of ideas they stand for natural causes of their imperfection especially in those that stand for mixed modes and for our ideas of substances words having naturally no signification the idea which each stands for must be learned and retained by those who would exchange thoughts and hold intelligible discourse with others in any language but this is the hardest to be done where first the ideas they stand for are very complex and made up of a great number of ideas put together secondly where the ideas they stand for have no certain connexion in nature and so no settled standard anywhere in nature existing to rectify and adjust them by thirdly when the signification of the word is referred to a standard which standard is not easy to be known fourthly where the signification of the word and the real essence of the thing are not exactly the same these are difficulties that attend the signification of several words that are intelligible those which are not intelligible at all such as names standing for any simple ideas which another has not organs or faculties to attain as the names of colours to a blind man or sounds to a deaf man need not here be mentioned in all these cases we shall find an imperfection in words which i shall more at large explain in their particular application to our several sorts of ideas for if we examine them we shall find that the names of mixed modes are most liable to doubtfulness and imperfection for the two first of these reasons and the names of substances chiefly for the two latter the names of mixed modes doubtful first because the ideas they stand for are so complex first the names of mixed modes are many of them liable to great uncertainty and obscurity in their signification i because of that great composition these complex ideas are often made up of to make words serviceable to the end of communication it is necessary as has been said that they excite in the hearer exactly the same idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker without this men fill one anothers heads with noise and sounds but convey not thereby their thoughts and lay not before one another their ideas which is the end of discourse and language but when a word stands for a very complex idea that is compounded and decompounded it is not easy for men to form and retain that idea so exactly as to make the name in common use stand for the same precise idea without any the least variation hence it comes to pass that mens names of very compound ideas such as for the most part are moral words have seldom in two different men the same precise signification since one mans complex idea seldom agrees with anothers and often differs from his ownfrom that which he had yesterday or will have tomorrow secondly because they have no standards in nature because the names of mixed modes for the most part want standards in nature whereby men may rectify and adjust their significations therefore they are very various and doubtful they are assemblages of ideas put together at the pleasure of the mind pursuing its own ends of discourse and suited to its own notions whereby it designs not to copy anything really existing but to denominate and rank things as they come to agree with those archetypes or forms it has made he that first brought the word sham or wheedle or banter in use put together as he thought fit those ideas he made it stand for and as it is with any new names of modes that are now brought into any language so it was with the old ones when they were first made use of names therefore that stand for collections of ideas which the mind makes at pleasure must needs be of doubtful signification when such collections are nowhere to be found constantly united in nature nor any patterns to be shown whereby men may adjust them what the word murder or sacrilege c signifies can never be known from things themselves there be many of the parts of those complex ideas which are not visible in the action itself the intention of the mind or the relation of holy things which make a part of murder or sacrilege have no necessary connexion with the outward and visible action of him that commits either and the pulling the trigger of the gun with which the murder is committed and is all the action that perhaps is visible has no natural connexion with those other ideas that make up the complex one named murder they have their union and combination only from the understanding which unites them under one name but uniting them without any rule or pattern it cannot be but that the signification of the name that stands for such voluntary collections should be often various in the minds of different men who have scarce any standing rule to regulate themselves and their notions by in such arbitrary ideas common use or propriety not a sufficient remedy it is true common use that is the rule of propriety may be supposed here to afford some aid to settle the signification of language and it cannot be denied but that in some measure it does common use regulates the meaning of words pretty well for common conversation but nobody having an authority to establish the precise signification of words nor determine to what ideas any one shall annex them common use is not sufficient to adjust them to philosophical discourses there being scarce any name of any very complex idea to say nothing of others which in common use has not a great latitude and which keeping within the bounds of propriety may not be made the sign of far different ideas besides the rule and measure of propriety itself being nowhere established it is often matter of dispute whether this or that way of using a word be propriety of speech or no from all which it is evident that the names of such kind of very complex ideas are naturally liable to this imperfection to be of doubtful and uncertain signification and even in men that have a mind to understand one another do not always stand for the same idea in speaker and hearer though the names glory and gratitude be the same in every mans mouth through a whole country yet the complex collective idea which every one thinks on or intends by that name is apparently very different in men using the same language the way of learning these names contributes also to their doubtfulness the way also wherein the names of mixed modes are ordinarily learned does not a little contribute to the doubtfulness of their signification for if we will observe how children learn languages we shall find that to make them understand what the names of simple ideas or substances stand for people ordinarily show them the thing whereof they would have them have the idea and then repeat to them the name that stands for it as white sweet milk sugar cat dog but as for mixed modes especially the most material of them moral words the sounds are usually learned first and then to know what complex ideas they stand for they are either beholden to the explication of others or which happens for the most part are left to their own observation and industry which being little laid out in the search of the true and precise meaning of names these moral words are in most mens mouths little more than bare sounds or when they have any it is for the most part but a very loose and undetermined and consequently obscure and confused signification and even those themselves who have with more attention settled their notions do yet hardly avoid the inconvenience to have them stand for complex ideas different from those which other even intelligent and studious men make them the signs of where shall one find any either controversial debate or familiar discourse concerning honour faith grace religion church c wherein it is not easy to observe the different notions men have of them which is nothing but this that they are not agreed in the signification of those words nor have in their minds the same complex ideas which they make them stand for and so all the contests that follow thereupon are only about the meaning of a sound and hence we see that in the interpretation of laws whether divine or human there is no end comments beget comments and explications make new matter for explications and of limiting distinguishing varying the signification of these moral words there is no end these ideas of mens making are by men still having the same power multiplied in infinitum many a man who was pretty well satisfied of the meaning of a text of scripture or clause in the code at first reading has by consulting commentators quite lost the sense of it and by these elucidations given rise or increase to his doubts and drawn obscurity upon the place i say not this that i think commentaries needless but to show how uncertain the names of mixed modes naturally are even in the mouths of those who had both the intention and the faculty of speaking as clearly as language was ca pable to express their thoughts hence unavoidable obscurity in ancient authors what obscurity this has unavoidably brought upon the writings of men who have lived in remote ages and different countries it will be needless to take notice since the numerous volumes of learned men employing their thoughts that way are proofs more than enough to show what attention study sagacity and reasoning are required to find out the true meaning of ancient authors but there being no writings we have any great concernment to be very solicitous about the meaning of but those that contain either truths we are required to believe or laws we are to obey and draw inconveniences on us when we mistake or transgress we may be less anxious about the sense of other authors who writing but their own opinions we are under no greater necessity to know them than they to know ours our good or evil depending not on their decrees we may safely be ignorant of their notions and therefore in the reading of them if they do not use their words with a due clearness and perspicuity we may lay them aside and without any injury done them resolve thus with ourselves si non vis intelligi debes negligi names of substances of doubtful signification because the ideas they stand for relate to the reality of things if the signification of the names of mixed modes be uncertain because there be no real standards existing in nature to which those ideas are referred and by which they may be adjusted the names of substances are of a doubtful signification for a contrary reason viz because the ideas they stand for are supposed conformable to the reality of things and are referred to as standards made by nature in our ideas of substances we have not the liberty as in mixed modes to frame what combinations we think fit to be the characteristical notes to rank and denominate things by in these we must follow nature suit our complex ideas to real existences and regulate the signification of their names by the things themselves if we will have our names to be signs of them and stand for them here it is true we have patterns to follow but patterns that will make the signification of their names very uncertain for names must be of a very unsteady and various meaning if the ideas they stand for be referred to standards without us that either cannot be known at all or can be known but imperfectly and uncertainly names of substances referred to real essences that cannot be known the names of substances have as has been shown a double reference in their ordinary use first sometimes they are made to stand for and so their signification is supposed to agree to the real constitution of things from which all their properties flow and in which they all centre but this real constitution or as it is apt to be called essence being utterly unknown to us any sound that is put to stand for it must be very uncertain in its application and it will be impossible to know what things are or ought to be called a horse or antimony when those words are put for real essences that we have no ideas of at all and therefore in this supposition the names of substances being referred to standards that cannot be known their significations can never be adjusted and established by those standards to coexisting qualities which are known but imperfectly secondly the simple ideas that are found to coexist in substances being that which their names immediately signify these as united in the several sorts of things are the proper standards to which their names are referred and by which their significations may be best rectified but neither will these archetypes so well serve to this purpose as to leave these names without very various and uncertain significations because these simple ideas that coexist and are united in the same subject being very numerous and having all an equal right to go into the complex specific idea which the specific name is to stand for men though they propose to themselves the very same subject to consider yet frame very different ideas about it and so the name they use for it unavoidably comes to have in several men very different significations the simple qualities which make up the complex ideas being most of them powers in relation to changes which they are apt to make in or receive from other bodies are almost infinite he that shall but observe what a great variety of alterations any one of the baser metals is apt to receive from the different application only of fire and how much a greater number of changes any of them will receive in the hands of a chymist by the application of other bodies will not think it strange that i count the properties of any sort of bodies not easy to be collected and completely known by the ways of inquiry which our faculties are capable of they being therefore at least so many that no man can know the precise and definite number they are differently discovered by different men according to their various skill attention and ways of handling who therefore cannot choose but have different ideas of the same substance and therefore make the signification of its common name very various and uncertain for the complex ideas of substances being made up of such simple ones as are supposed to coexist in nature every one has a right to put into his complex idea those qualities he has found to be united together for though in the substance of gold one satisfies himself with colour and weight yet another thinks solubility in aqua regia as necessary to be joined with that colour in his idea of gold as any one does its fusibility solubility in aqua regia being a quality as constantly joined with its colour and weight as fusibility or any other others put into it ductility or fixedness c as they have been taught by tradition or experience who of all these has established the right signification of the word gold or who shall be the judge to determine each has his standard in nature which he appeals to and with reason thinks he has the same right to put into his complex idea signified by the word gold those qualities which upon trial he has found united as another who has not so well examined has to leave them out or a third who has made other trials has to put in others for the union in nature of these qualities being the true ground of their union in one complex idea who can say one of them has more reason to be put in or left out than another from hence it will unavoid ably follow that the complex ideas of substances in men using the same names for them will be very various and so the significations of those names very uncertain thirdly to coexisting qualities which are known but imperfectly besides there is scarce any particular thing existing which in some of its simple ideas does not communicate with a greater and in others a less number of particular beings who shall determine in this case which are those that are to make up the precise collection that is to be signified by the specific name or can with any just authority prescribe which obvious or common qualities are to be left out or which more secret or more particular are to be put into the signification of the name of any substance all which together seldom or never fall to produce that various and doubtful signification in the names of substances which causes such uncertainty disputes or mistakes when we come to a philosophical use of them with this imperfection they may serve for civil but not well for philosophical use it is true as to civil and common conversation the general names of substances regulated in their ordinary signification by some obvious qualities as by the shape and figure in things of known seminal propagation and in other substances for the most part by colour joined with some other sensible qualities do well enough to design the things men would be understood to speak of and so they usually conceive well enough the substances meant by the word gold or apple to distinguish the one from the other but in philosophical inquiries and debates where general truths are to be established and consequences drawn from positions laid down there the precise signification of the names of substances will be found not only not to be well established but also very hard to be so for example he that shall make malleability or a certain degree of fixedness a part of his complex idea of gold may make propositions concerning gold and draw consequences from them that will truly and clearly follow from gold taken in such a signification but yet such as another man can never be forced to admit nor be convinced of their truth who makes not malleableness or the same degree of fixedness part of that com plex idea that the name gold in his use of it stands for instance liquor this is a natural and almost unavoidable imperfection in almost all the names of substances in all languages whatsoever which men will easily find when once passing from confused or loose notions they come to more strict and close inquiries for then they will be convinced how doubtful and obscure those words are in their signification which in ordinary use appeared very clear and determined i was once in a meeting of very learned and ingenious physicians where by chance there arose a question whether any liquor passed through the filaments of the nerves the debate having been managed a good while by variety of arguments on both sides i who had been used to suspect that the greatest part of disputes were more about the signification of words than a real difference in the conception of things desired that before they went any further on in this dispute they would first examine and establish amongst them what the word liquor signified they at first were a little surprised at the proposal and had they been persons less ingenious they might perhaps have taken it for a very frivolous or extravagant one since there was no one there that thought not himself to understand very perfectly what the word liquor stood for which i think too none of the most perplexed names of substances however they were pleased to comply with my motion and upon examination found that the signification of that word was not so settled or certain as they had all imagined but that each of them made it a sign of a different complex idea this made them perceive that the main of their dispute was about the signification of that term and that they differed very little in their opinions concerning some fluid and subtle matter passing through the conduits of the nerves though it was not so easy to agree whether it was to be called liquor or no a thing which when considered they thought it not worth the contending about instance gold how much this is the case in the greatest part of disputes that men are engaged so hotly in i shall perhaps have an occasion in another place to take notice let us only here consider a little more ex actly the forementioned instance of the word gold and we shall see how hard it is precisely to determine its signification i think all agree to make it stand for a body of a certain yellow shining colour which being the idea to which children have annexed that name the shining yellow part of a peacocks tail is properly to them gold others finding fusibility joined with that yellow colour in certain parcels of matter make of that combination a complex idea to which they give the name gold to denote a sort of substances and so exclude from being gold all such yellow shining bodies as by fire will be reduced to ashes and admit to be of that species or to be comprehended under that name gold only such substances as having that shining yellow colour will by fire be reduced to fusion and not to ashes another by the same reason adds the weight which being a quality as straightly joined with that colour as its fusibility he thinks has the same reason to be joined in its idea and to be signified by its name and therefore the other made up of body of such a colour and fusibility to be imperfect and so on of all the rest wherein no one can show a reason why some of the inseparable qualities that are always united in nature should be put into the nominal essence and others left out or why the word gold signifying that sort of body the ring on his finger is made of should determine that sort rather by its colour weight and fusibility than by its colour weight and solubility in aqua regia since the dissolving it by that liquor is as inseparable from it as the fusion by fire and they are both of them nothing but the relation which that substance has to two other bodies which have a power to operate differently upon it for by what right is it that fusibility comes to be a part of the essence signified by the word gold and solubility but a property of it or why is its colour part of the essence and its malleableness but a property that which i mean is this that these being all but properties depending on its real constitution and nothing but powers either active or passive in reference to other bodies no one has authority to determine the signification of the word gold as referred to such a body existing in nature more to one collection of ideas to be found in that body than to another whereby the signification of that name must unavoidably be very uncertain since as has been said several people observe several properties in the same substance and i think i may say nobody all and therefore we have but very imperfect descriptions of things and words have very uncertain significations the names of simple ideas the least doubtful from what has been said it is easy to observe what has been before remarked viz that the names of simple ideas are of all others the least liable to mistakes and that for these reasons first because the ideas they stand for being each but one single perception are much easier got and more clearly retained than the more complex ones and therefore are not liable to the uncertainty which usually attends those compounded ones of substances and mixed modes in which the precise number of simple ideas that make them up are not easily agreed so readily kept in mind and secondly because they are never referred to any other essence but barely that perception they immediately signify which reference is that which renders the signification of the names of substances naturally so perplexed and gives occasion to so many disputes men that do not perversely use their words or on purpose set themselves to cavil seldom mistake in any language which they are acquainted with the use and signification of the name of simple ideas white and sweet yellow and bitter carry a very obvious meaning with them which every one precisely comprehends or easily perceives he is ignorant of and seeks to be informed but what precise collection of simple ideas modesty or frugality stand for in anothers use is not so certainly known and however we are apt to think we well enough know what is meant by gold or iron yet the precise complex idea others make them the signs of is not so certain and i believe it is very seldom that in speaker and hearer they stand for exactly the same collection which must needs produce mistakes and disputes when they are made use of in discourses wherein men have to do with universal propositions and would settle in their minds universal truths and consider the consequences that follow from them and next to them simple modes by the same rule the names of simple modes are next to those of simple ideas least liable to doubt and uncertainty especially those of figure and number of which men have so clear and distinct ideas who ever that had a mind to understand them mistook the ordinary meaning of seven or a triangle and in general the least compounded ideas in every kind have the least dubious names the most doubtful are the names of very compounded mixed modes and substances mixed modes therefore that are made up but of a few and obvious simple ideas have usually names of no very uncertain signification but the names of mixed modes which comprehend a great number of simple ideas are commonly of a very doubtful and undetermined meaning as has been shown the names of substances being annexed to ideas that are neither the real essences nor exact representations of the patterns they are referred to are liable to yet greater imperfection and uncertainty especially when we come to a philosophical use of them why this imperfection charged upon words the great disorder that happens in our names of substances proceeding for the most part from our want of knowledge and inability to penetrate into their real constitutions it may probably be wondered why i charge this as an imperfection rather upon our words than understandings this exception has so much appearance of justice that i think myself obliged to give a reason why i have followed this method i must confess then that when i first began this discourse of the understanding and a good while after i had not the least thought that any consideration of words was at all necessary to it but when having passed over the original and composition of our ideas i began to examine the extent and certainty of our knowledge i found it had so near a connexion with words that unless their force and manner of signification were first well observed there could be very little said clearly and pertinently concerning knowledge which being conversant about truth had constantly to do with propositions and though it terminated in things yet it was for the most part so much by the intervention of words that they seemed scarce separable from our general knowledge at least they interpose themselves so much between our understandings and the truth which it would contemplate and apprehend that like the medium through which visible objects pass the obscurity and disorder do not seldom cast a mist before our eyes and impose upon our understandings if we consider in the fallacies men put upon themselves as well as others and the mistakes in mens disputes and notions how great a part is owing to words and their uncertain or mistaken significations we shall have reason to think this no small obstacle in the way to knowledge which i conclude we are the more carefully to be warned of because it has been so far from being taken notice of as an inconvenience that the arts of improving it have been made the business of mens study and obtained the reputation of learning and subtilty as we shall see in the following chapter but i am apt to imagine that were the imperfections of language as the instrument of knowledge more thoroughly weighed a great many of the controversies that make such a noise in the world would of themselves cease and the way to knowledge and perhaps peace too lie a great deal opener than it does this should teach us moderation in imposing our own sense of old authors sure i am that the signification of words in all languages depending very much on the thoughts notions and ideas of him that uses them must unavoidably be of great uncertainty to men of the same language and country this is so evident in the greek authors that he that shall peruse their writings will find in almost every one of them a distinct language though the same words but when to this natural difficulty in every country there shall be added different countries and remote ages wherein the speakers and writers had very different notions tempers customs ornaments and figures of speech c every one of which influenced the signification of their words then though to us now they are lost and unknown it would become us to be charitable one to another in our interpretations or misunderstandings of those ancient writings which though of great concernment to be understood are liable to the unavoidable difficulties of speech which if we except the names of simple ideas and some very obvious things is not capable without a constant defining the terms of conveying the sense and intention of the speaker without any manner of doubt and uncertainty to the hearer and in discourses of religion law and morality as they are matters of the highest concernment so there will be the greatest difficulty especially of the old and new testament scriptures the volumes of interpreters and commentators on the old and new testament are but too manifest proofs of this though everything said in the text be infallibly true yet the reader may be nay cannot choose but be very fallible in the understanding of it nor is it to be wondered that the will of god when clothed in words should be liable to that doubt and uncertainty which unavoidably attends that sort of conveyance when even his son whilst clothed in flesh was subject to all the frailties and inconveniences of human nature sin excepted and we ought to magnify his goodness that he hath spread before all the world such legible characters of his works and providence and given all mankind so sufficient a light of reason that they to whom this written word never came could not whenever they set themselves to search either doubt of the being of a god or of the obedience due to him since then the precepts of natural religion are plain and very intelligible to all mankind and seldom come to be controverted and other revealed truths which are conveyed to us by books and languages are liable to the common and natural obscurities and difficulties incident to words methinks it would become us to be more careful and diligent in observing the former and less magisterial positive and imperious in imposing our own sense and interpretations of the latter of the abuse of words woeful abuse of words besides the imperfection that is naturally in language and the obscurity and confusion that is so hard to be avoided in the use of words there are several wilful faults and neglects which men are guilty of in this way of communication whereby they render these signs less clear and distinct in their signification than naturally they need to be words are often employed without any or without clear ideas first in this kind the first and most palpable abuse is the using of words without clear and distinct ideas or which is worse signs without anything signified of these there are two sorts i some words introduced without clear ideas annexed to them even in their first original one may observe in all languages certain words that if they be examined will be found in their first original and their appropriated use not to stand for any clear and distinct ideas these for the most part the several sects of philosophy and religion have introduced for their authors or promoters either affecting something singular and out of the way of common apprehensions or to support some strange opinions or cover some weakness of their hypothesis seldom fail to coin new words and such as when they come to be examined may justly be called insignificant terms for having either had no determinate collection of ideas annexed to them when they were first invented or at least such as if well examined will be found inconsistent it is no wonder if afterwards in the vulgar use of the same party they remain empty sounds with little or no signification amongst those who think it enough to have them often in their mouths as the distinguishing characters of their church or school without much troubling their heads to examine what are the precise ideas they stand for i shall not need here to heap up instances every mans reading and conversation will sufficiently furnish him or if he wants to be better stored the great mintmasters of this kind of terms i mean the schoolmen and metaphysicians under which i think the disputing natural and moral philosophers of these latter ages may be comprehended have wherewithal abundantly to content him ii other words to which ideas were annexed at first used afterwards without distinct meanings others there be who extend this abuse yet further who take so little care to lay by words which in their primary notation have scarce any clear and distinct ideas which they are annexed to that by an unpardonable negligence they familiarly use words which the propriety of language has affixed to very important ideas without any distinct meaning at all wisdom glory grace c are words frequent enough in every mans mouth but if a great many of those who use them should be asked what they mean by them they would be at a stand and not know what to answer a plain proof that though they have learned those sounds and have them ready at their tongues ends yet there are no determined ideas laid up in their minds which are to be expressed to others by them this occasioned by men learning names before they have the ideas the names belong to men having been accustomed from their cradles to learn words which are easily got and retained before they knew or had framed the complex ideas to which they were annexed or which were to be found in the things they were thought to stand for they usually continue to do so all their lives and without taking the pains necessary to settle in their minds determined ideas they use their words for such unsteady and confused notions as they have contenting themselves with the same words other people use as if their very sound necessarily carried with it constantly the same meaning this though men make a shift with in the ordinary occurrences of life where they find it necessary to be understood and therefore they make signs till they are so yet this insignificancy in their words when they come to reason concerning either their tenets or interest manifestly fills their discourse with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon especially in moral matters where the words for the most part standing for arbitrary and numerous collections of ideas not regularly and permanently united in nature their bare sounds are often only thought on or at least very obscure and uncertain notions annexed to them men take the words they find in use amongst their neighbors and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for use them confidently without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning whereby besides the ease of it they obtain this advantage that as in such discourses they seldom are in the right so they are as seldom to be convinced that they are in the wrong it being all one to go about to draw those men out of their mistakes who have no settled notions as to dispossess a vagrant of his habitation who has no settled abode this i guess to be so and every one may observe in himself and others whether it be so or not unsteady application of them secondly another great abuse of words is inconstancy in the use of them it is hard to find a discourse written on any subject especially of controversy wherein one shall not observe if he read with attention the same words and those commonly the most material in the discourse and upon which the argument turns used sometimes for one collection of simple ideas and sometimes for another which is a perfect abuse of language words being intended for signs of my ideas to make them known to others not by any natural signification but by a voluntary imposition it is plain cheat and abuse when i make them stand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another the wilful doing whereof can be imputed to nothing but great folly or greater dishonesty and a man in his accounts with another may with as much fairness make the characters of numbers stand sometimes for one and sometimes for another collection of units vg this character stand sometimes for three sometimes for four and sometimes for eight as in his discourse or reasoning make the same words stand for different collections of simple ideas if men should do so in their reckonings i wonder who would have to do with them one who would speak thus in the affairs and business of the world and call sometimes seven and sometimes nine as best served his advantage would presently have clapped upon him one of the two names men are commonly disgusted with and yet in arguings and learned contests the same sort of proceedings passes commonly for wit and learning but to me it appears a greater dishonesty than the misplacing of counters in the casting up a debt and the cheat the greater by how much truth is of greater concernment and value than money iii affected obscurity as in the peripatetick and other sects of philosophy thirdly another abuse of language is an affected obscurity by either applying old words to new and unusual significations or introducing new and ambiguous terms without defining either or else putting them so together as may confound their ordinary meaning though the peripatetick philosophy has been most eminent in this way yet other sects have not been wholly clear of it there are scarce any of them that are not cumbered with some difficulties such is the imperfection of human knowledge which they have been fain to cover with obscurity of terms and to confound the signification of words which like a mist before peoples eyes might hinder their weak parts from being discovered that body and extension in common use stand for two distinct ideas is plain to any one that will but reflect a little for were their signification precisely the same it would be as proper and as intelligible to say the body of an extension as the extension of a body and yet there are those who find it necessary to confound their signification to this abuse and the mischiefs of confounding the signification of words logic and the liberal sciences as they have been handled in the schools have given reputation and the admired art of disputing hath added much to the natural imperfection of languages whilst it has been made use of and fitted to perplex the signification of words more than to discover the knowledge and truth of things and he that will look into that sort of learned writings will find the words there much more obscure uncertain and undetermined in their meaning than they are in ordinary conversation logic and dispute have much contributed to this this is unavoidably to be so where mens parts and learning are estimated by their skill in disputing and if reputation and reward shall attend these conquests which depend mostly on the fineness and niceties of words it is no wonder if the wit of man so employed should perplex involve and subtilize the signification of sounds so as never to want something to say in opposing or defending any question the victory being adjudged not to him who had truth on his side but the last word in the dispute calling it subtlety this though a very useless skin and that which i think the direct opposite to the ways of knowledge hath yet passed hitherto under the laudable and esteemed names of subtlety and acuteness and has had the applause of the schools and encouragement of one part of the learned men of the world and no wonder since the philosophers of old the disputing and wrangling philosophers i mean such as lucian wittily and with reason taxes and the schoolmen since aiming at glory and esteem for their great and universal knowledge easier a great deal to be pretended to than really acquired found this a good expedient to cover their ignorance with a curious and inexplicable web of perplexed words and procure to themselves the admiration of others by unintelligible terms the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understood whilst it appears in all history that these profound doctors were no wiser nor more useful than their neighbours and brought but small advantage to human life or the societies wherein they lived unless the coining of new words where they produced no new things to apply them to or the perplexing or obscuring the signification of old ones and so bringing all things into question and dispute were a thing profitable to the life of man or worthy commendation and reward this learning very little benefits society for notwithstanding these learned disputants these allknowing doctors it was to the unscholastic statesman that the governments of the world owed their peace defence and liberties and from the illiterate and contemned mechanic a name of disgrace that they received the improvements of useful arts nevertheless this artificial ignorance and learned gibberish prevailed mightily in these last ages by the interest and artifice of those who found no easier way to that pitch of authority and dominion they have attained than by amusing the men of business and ignorant with hard words or employing the ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth besides there is no such way to gain admittance or give defence to strange and absurd doctrines as to guard them round about with legions of obscure doubtful and undefined words which yet make these retreats more like the dens of robbers or holes of foxes than the fortresses of fair warriors which if it be hard to get them out of it is not for the strength that is in them but the briars and thorns and the obscurity of the thickets they are beset with for untruth being unacceptable to the mind of man there is no other defence left for absurdity but obscurity but destroys the instruments of knowledge and communication thus learned ignorance and this art of keeping even inquisitive men from true knowledge hath been propagated in the world and hath much perplexed whilst it pretended to inform the understanding for we see that other wellmeaning and wise men whose education and parts had not acquired that acuteness could intelligibly express themselves to one another and in its plain use make a benefit of language but though unlearned men well enough understood the words white and black c and had constant notions of the ideas signified by those words yet there were philosophers found who had learning and subtlety enough to prove that snow was black ie to prove that white was black whereby they had the advantage to destroy the instruments and means of discourse conversation instruction and society whilst with great art and subtlety they did no more but perplex and confound the signification of words and thereby render language less useful than the real defects of it had made it a gift which the illiterate had not attained to as useful as to confound the sounds that the letters of the alphabet stand for these learned men did equally instruct mens understandings and profit their lives as he who should alter the signification of known characters and by a subtle device of learning far surpassing the capacity of the illiterate dull and vulgar should in his writing show that he could put a for b and d for e c to the no small admiration and benefit of his reader it being as senseless to put black which is a word agreed on to stand for one sensible idea to put it i say for another or the contrary idea ie to call snow black as to put this mark a which is a character agreed on to stand for one modification of sound made by a certain motion of the organs of speech for b which is agreed on to stand for another modification of sound made by another certain mode of the organs of speech this art has perplexed religion and justice nor hath this mischief stopped in logical niceties or curious empty speculations it hath invaded the great concernments of human life and society obscured and perplexed the material truths of law and divinity brought confusion disorder and uncertainty into the affairs of mankind and if not destroyed yet in a great measure rendered useless these two great rules religion and justice what have the greatest part of the comments and disputes upon the laws of god and man served for but to make the meaning more doubtful and perplex the sense what have been the effect of those multiplied curious distinctions and acute niceties but obscurity and uncertainty leaving the words more unintelligible and the reader more at a loss how else comes it to pass that princes speaking or writing to their servants in their ordinary commands are easily understood speaking to their people in their laws are not so and as i remarked before doth it not often happen that a man of an ordinary capacity very well understands a text or a law that he reads till he consults an expositor or goes to counsel who by that time he hath done explaining them makes the words signify either nothing at all or what he pleases and ought not to pass for learning whether any byinterests of these professions have occasioned this i will not here examine but i leave it to be considered whether it would not be well for mankind whose concernment it is to know things as they are and to do what they ought and not to spend their lives in talking about them or tossing words to and frowhether it would not be well i say that the use of words were made plain and direct and that language which was given us for the improvement of knowledge and bond of society should not be employed to darken truth and unsettle peoples rights to raise mists and render unintelligible both morality and religion or that at least if this will happen it should not be thought learning or knowledge to do so iv by taking words for things fourthly another great abuse of words is the taking them for things this though it in some degree concerns all names in general yet more particularly affects those of substances to this abuse those men are most subject who most confine their thoughts to anyone system and give themselves up into a firm belief of the perfection of any received hypothesis whereby they come to be persuaded that the terms of that sect are so suited to the nature of things that they perfectly correspond with their real existence who is there that has been bred up in the peripatetick philosophy who does not think the ten names under which are ranked the ten predicaments to be exactly conformable to the nature of things who is there of that school that is not persuaded that substantial forms vegetative souls abhorrence of a vacuum intentional species c are something real these words men have learned from their very entrance upon knowledge and have found their masters and systems lay great stress upon them and therefore they cannot quit the opinion that they are conformable to nature and are the representations of something that really exists the platonists have their soul of the world and the epicureans their endeavour towards motion in their atoms when at rest there is scarce any sect in philosophy has not a distinct set of terms that others understand not but yet this gibberish which in the weakness of human understanding serves so well to palliate mens ignorance and cover their errors comes by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe to seem the most important part of language and of all other the terms the most significant and should aerial and aetherial vehicles come once by the prevalency of that doctrine to be generally received anywhere no doubt those terms would make impressions on mens minds so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such things as much as peripatetick forms and intentional species have heretofore done instance in matter how much names taken for things are apt to mislead the understanding the attentive reading of philosophical writers would abundantly discover and that perhaps in words little suspected of any such misuse i shall instance in one only and that a very familiar one how many intricate disputes have there been about matter as if there were some such thing really in nature distinct from body as it is evident the word matter stands for an idea distinct from the idea of body for if the ideas these two terms stood for were precisely the same they might indifferently in all places be put for one another but we see that though it be proper to say there is one matter of all bodies one cannot say there is one body of all matters we familiarly say one body is bigger than another but it sounds harsh and i think is never used to say one matter is bigger than another whence comes this then viz from hence that though matter and body be not really distinct but wherever there is the one there is the other yet matter and body stand for two different conceptions whereof the one is incomplete and but a part of the other for body stands for a solid extended figured substance whereof matter is but a partial and more confused conception it seeming to me to be used for the substance and solidity of body without taking in its extension and figure and therefore it is that speaking of matter we speak of it always as one because in truth it expressly contains nothing but the idea of a solid substance which is everywhere the same everywhere uniform this being our idea of matter we no more conceive or speak of different matters in the world than we do of different solidities though we both conceive and speak of different bodies because extension and figure are capable of variation but since solidity cannot exist without extension and figure the taking matter to be the name of something really existing under that precision has no doubt produced those obscure and unintelligible discourses and disputes which have filled the heads and books of philosophers concerning materia prima which imperfection or abuse how far it may concern a great many other general terms i leave to be considered this i think i may at least say that we should have a great many fewer disputes in the world if words were taken for what they are the signs of our ideas only and not for things themselves for when we argue about matter or any the like term we truly argue only about the idea we express by that sound whether that precise idea agree to anything really existing in nature or no and if men would tell what ideas they make their words stand for there could not be half that obscurity or wrangling in the search or support of truth that there is this makes errors lasting but whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of words this i am sure that by constant and familiar use they charm men into notions far remote from the truth of things it would be a hard matter to persuade any one that the words which his father or schoolmaster the parson of the parish or such a reverend doctor used signified nothing that really existed in nature which perhaps is none of the least causes that men are so hardly drawn to quit their mistakes even in opinions purely philosophical and where they have no other interest but truth for the words they have a long time been used to remaining firm in their minds it is no wonder that the wrong notions annexed to them should not be removed v by setting them in the place of what they cannot signify fifthly another abuse of words is the setting them in the place of things which they do or can by no means signify we may observe that in the general names of substances whereof the nominal essences are only known to us when we put them into propositions and affirm or deny anything about them we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend they should stand for the real essence of a certain sort of substances for when a man says gold is malleable he means and would insinuate something more than this that what i call gold is malleable though truly it amounts to no more but would have this understood viz that gold ie what has the real essence of gold is malleable which amounts to thus much that malleableness depends on and is inseparable from the real essence of gold but a man not knowing wherein that real essence consists the connexion in his mind of malleableness is not truly with an essence he knows not but only with the sound gold he puts for it thus when we say that animal rationale is and animal implume bipes latis unguibus is not a good definition of a man it is plain we suppose the name man in this case to stand for the real essence of a species and would signify that a rational animal better described that real essence than a twolegged animal with broad nails and without feathers for else why might not plato as properly make the word anthropos or man stand for his complex idea made up of the idea of a body distinguished from others by a certain shape and other outward appearances as aristotle make the complex idea to which he gave the name anthropos or man of body and the faculty of reasoning joined together unless the name anthropos or man were supposed to stand for something else than what it signifies and to be put in the place of some other thing than the idea a man professes he would express by it vg putting them for the real essences of substances it is true the names of substances would be much more useful and propositions made in them much more certain were the real essences of substances the ideas in our minds which those words signified and it is for want of those real essences that our words convey so little knowledge or certainty in our discourses about them and therefore the mind to remove that imperfection as much as it can makes them by a secret supposition to stand for a thing having that real essence as if thereby it made some nearer approaches to it for though the word man or gold signify nothing truly but a complex idea of properties united together in one sort of substances yet there is scarce anybody in the use of these words but often supposes each of those names to stand for a thing having the real essence on which these properties depend which is so far from diminishing the imperfection of our words that by a plain abuse it adds to it when we would make them stand for something which not being in our complex idea the name we use can no ways be the sign of hence we think change of our complex ideas of substances not to change their species this shows us the reason why in mixed modes any of the ideas that make the composition of the complex one being left out or changed it is allowed to be another thing ie to be of another species as is plain in chancemedley manslaughter murder parricide c the reason whereof is because the complex idea signified by that name is the real as well as nominal essence and there is no secret reference of that name to any other essence but that but in substances it is not so for though in that called gold one puts into his complex idea what another leaves out and vice versa yet men do not usually think that therefore the species is changed because they secretly in their minds refer that name and suppose it annexed to a real immutable essence of a thing existing on which those properties depend he that adds to his complex idea of gold that of fixedness and solubility in aqua regia which he put not in it before is not thought to have changed the species but only to have a more perfect idea by adding another simple idea which is always in fact joined with those other of which his former complex idea consisted but this reference of the name to a thing whereof we have not the idea is so far from helping at all that it only serves the more to involve us in difficulties for by this tacit reference to the real essence of that species of bodies the word gold which by standing for a more or less perfect collection of simple ideas serves to design that sort of body well enough in civil discourse comes to have no signification at all being put for somewhat whereof we have no idea at all and so can signify nothing at all when the body itself is away for however it may be thought all one yet if well considered it will be found a quite different thing to argue about gold in name and about a parcel in the body itself vg a piece of leafgold laid before us though in discourse we are fain to substitute the name for the thing the cause of this abuse a supposition of natures working always regularly in setting boundaries to species that which i think very much disposes men to substitute their names for the real essences of species is the supposition before mentioned that nature works regularly in the production of things and sets the boundaries to each of those species by giving exactly the same real internal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general name whereas anyone who observes their different qualities can hardly doubt that many of the individuals called by the same name are in their internal constitution as different one from another as several of those which are ranked under differ ent specific names this supposition however that the same precise and internal constitution goes always with the same specific name makes men forward to take those names for the representatives of those real essences though indeed they signify nothing but the complex ideas they have in their minds when they use them so that if i may so say signifying one thing and being supposed for or put in the place of another they cannot but in such a kind of use cause a great deal of uncertainty in mens discourses especially in those who have thoroughly imbibed the doctrine of substantial forms whereby they firmly imagine the several species of things to be determined and distinguished this abuse contains two false suppositions but however preposterous and absurd it be to make our names stand for ideas we have not or which is all one essences that we know not it being in effect to make our words the signs of nothing yet it is evident to any one who ever so little reflects on the use men make of their words that there is nothing more familiar when a man asks whether this or that thing he sees let it be a drill or a monstrous foetus be a man or no it is evident the question is not whether that particular thing agree to his complex idea expressed by the name man but whether it has in it the real essence of a species of things which he supposes his name man to stand for in which way of using the names of substances there are these false suppositions contained first that there are certain precise essences according to which nature makes all particular things and by which they are distinguished into species that everything has a real constitution whereby it is what it is and on which its sensible qualities depend is past doubt but i think it has been proved that this makes not the distinction of species as we rank them nor the boundaries of their names secondly this tacitly also insinuates as if we had ideas of these proposed essences for to what purpose else is it to inquire whether this or that thing have the real essence of the species man if we did not suppose that there were such a specific essence known which yet is utterly false and therefore such application of names as would make them stand for ideas which we have not must needs cause great disorder in discourses and reasonings about them and be a great inconvenience in our communication by words vi by proceeding upon the supposition that the words we use have a certain and evident signification which other men cannot but understand sixthly there remains yet another more general though perhaps less observed abuse of words and that is that men having by a long and familiar use annexed to them certain ideas they are apt to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the names and the signification they use them in that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what their meaning is and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the words delivered as if it were past doubt that in the use of those common received sounds the speaker and hearer had necessarily the same precise ideas whence presuming that when they have in discourse used any term they have thereby as it were set before others the very thing they talked of and so likewise taking the words of others as naturally standing for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply them to they never trouble themselves to explain their own or understand clearly others meaning from whence commonly proceeds noise and wrangling without improvement or information whilst men take words to be the constant regular marks of agreed notions which in truth are no more but the voluntary and unsteady signs of their own ideas and yet men think it strange if in discourse or where it is often absolutely necessary in dispute one sometimes asks the meaning of their terms though the arguings one may every day observe in conversation make it evident that there are few names of complex ideas which any two men use for the same just precise collection it is hard to name a word which is hard to name a word which will not be a clear instance of this life is a term none more familiar any one almost would take it for an affront to be asked what he meant by it and yet if it comes in question whether a plant that lies ready formed in the seed have life whether the embryo in an egg before incubation or a man in a swoon without sense or motion be alive or no it is easy to perceive that a clear distinct settled idea does not always accompany the use of so known a word as that of life is some gross and confused conceptions men indeed ordinarily have to which they apply the common words of their language and such a loose use of their words serves them well enough in their ordinary discourses or affairs but this is not sufficient for philosophical inquiries knowledge and reasoning require precise determinate ideas and though men will not be so importunately dull as not to understand what others say without demanding an explication of their terms nor so troublesomely critical as to correct others in the use of the words they receive from them yet where truth and knowledge are concerned in the case i know not what fault it can be to desire the explication of words whose sense seems dubious or why a man should be ashamed to own his ignorance in what sense another man uses his words since he has no other way of certainly knowing it but by being informed this abuse of taking words upon trust has nowhere spread so far nor with so ill effects as amongst men of letters the multiplication and obstinacy of disputes which have so laid waste the intellectual world is owing to nothing more than to this ill use of words for though it be generally believed that there is great diversity of opinions in the volumes and variety of controversies the world is distracted with yet the most i can find that the contending learned men of different parties do in their arguings one with another is that they speak different languages for i am apt to imagine that when any of them quitting terms think upon things and know what they think they think all the same though perhaps what they would have be different the ends of language first to convey our ideas to conclude this consideration of the imperfection and abuse of language the ends of language in our discourse with others being chiefly these three first to make known one mans thoughts or ideas to another secondly to do it with as much ease and quickness as possible and thirdly thereby to convey the knowledge of things language is either abused of deficient when it fails of any of these three first words fail in the first of these ends and lay not open one mans ideas to anothers view when men have names in their mouths without any determinate ideas in their minds whereof they are the signs or when they apply the common received names of any language to ideas to which the common use of that language does not apply them or when they apply them very unsteadily making them stand now for one and by and by for another idea to do it with quickness secondly men fail of conveying their thoughts with all the quickness and ease that may be when they have complex ideas without having any distinct names for them this is sometimes the fault of the language itself which has not in it a sound yet applied to such a signification and sometimes the fault of the man who has not yet learned the name for that idea he would show another therewith to convey the knowledge of things thirdly there is no knowledge of things conveyed by mens words when their ideas agree not to the reality of things though it be a defect that has its original in our ideas which are not so conformable to the nature of things as attention study and application might make them yet it fails not to extend itself to our words too when we use them as signs of real beings which yet never had any reality or existence how mens words fail in all these first when used without any ideas first he that hath words of any language without distinct ideas in his mind to which he applies them does so far as he uses them in discourse only make a noise without any sense or signification and how learned soever he may seem by the use of hard words or learned terms is not much more advanced thereby in knowledge than he would be in learning who had nothing in his study but the bare titles of books without possessing the contents of them for all such words however put into discourse according to the right construction of grammatical rules or the harmony of wellturned periods do yet amount to nothing but bare sounds and nothing else when complex ideas are without names annexed to them secondly he that has complex ideas without particular names for them would be in no better case than a bookseller who had in his warehouse volumes that lay there unbound and without titles which he could therefore make known to others only by showing the loose sheets and communicate them only by tale this man is hindered in his discourse for want of words to communicate his complex ideas which he is therefore forced to make known by an enumeration of the simple ones that compose them and so is fain often to use twenty words to express what another man signifies in one when the same sign is not put for the same idea thirdly he that puts not constantly the same sign for the same idea but uses the same words sometimes in one and sometimes in another signification ought to pass in the schools and conversation for as fair a man as he does in the market and exchange who sells several things under the same name when words are diverted from their common use fourthly he that applies the words of any language to ideas different from those to which the common use of that country applies them however his own understanding may be filled with truth and light will not by such words be able to convey much of it to others without defining his terms for however the sounds are such as are familiarly known and easily enter the ears of those who are accustomed to them yet standing for other ideas than those they usually are annexed to and are wont to excite in the mind of the hearers they cannot make known the thoughts of him who thus uses them when they are names of fantastical imaginations fifthly he that imagined to himself substances such as never have been and filled his head with ideas which have not any correspondence with the real nature of things to which yet he gives settled and defined names may fill his discourse and perhaps another mans head with the fantastical imaginations of his own brain but will be very far from advancing thereby one jot in real and true knowledge summary he that hath names without ideas wants meaning in his words and speaks only empty sounds he that hath complex ideas without names for them wants liberty and dispatch in his expressions and is necessitated to use periphrases he that uses his words loosely and unsteadily will either be not minded or not understood he that applies his names to ideas different from their common use wants propriety in his language and speaks gibberish and he that hath the ideas of substances disagreeing with the real existence of things so far wants the materials of true knowledge in his understanding and hath instead thereof chimeras how mens words fail when they stand for substances in our notions concerning substances we are liable to all the former inconveniences vg he that uses the word tarantula without having any imagination or idea of what it stands for pronounces a good word but so long means nothing at all by it he that in a newlydiscovered country shall see several sorts of animals and vegetables unknown to him before may have as true ideas of them as of a horse or a stag but can speak of them only by a description till he shall either take the names the natives call them by or give them names himself he that uses the word body sometimes for pure extension and sometimes for extension and solidity together will talk very fallaciously he that gives the name horse to that idea which common usage calls mule talks improperly and will not be understood he that thinks the name centaur stands for some real being imposes on himself and mistakes words for things how when they stand for modes and relations in modes and relations generally we are liable only to the four first of these inconveniences viz i may have in my memory the names of modes as gratitude or charity and yet not have any precise ideas annexed in my thoughts to those names i may have ideas and not know the names that belong to them vg i may have the idea of a mans drinking till his colour and humour be altered till his tongue trips and his eyes look red and his feet fail him and yet not know that it is to be called drunkenness i may have the ideas of virtues or vices and names also but apply them amiss vg when i apply the name frugality to that idea which others call and signify by this sound covetousness i may use any of those names with inconstancy but in modes and relations i cannot have ideas disagreeing to the existence of things for modes being complex ideas made by the mind at plea sure and relation being but by way of considering or comparing two things together and so also an idea of my own making these ideas can scarce be found to disagree with anything existing since they are not in the mind as the copies of things regularly made by nature nor as properties inseparably flowing from the internal constitution or essence of any substance but as it were patterns lodged in my memory with names annexed to them to denominate actions and relations by as they come to exist but the mistake is commonly in my giving a wrong name to my conceptions and so using words in a different sense from other people i am not understood but am thought to have wrong ideas of them when i give wrong names to them only if i put in my ideas of mixed modes or relations any inconsistent ideas together i fill my head also with chimeras since such ideas if well examined cannot so much as exist in the mind much less any real being ever be denominated from them seventhly language is often abused by figurative speech since wit and fancy find easier entertainment in the world than dry truth and real knowledge figurative speeches and allusion in language will hardly be admitted as an imperfection or abuse of it i confess in discourses where we seek rather pleasure and delight than information and improvement such ornaments as are borrowed from them can scarce pass for faults but yet if we would speak of things as they are we must allow that all the art of rhetoric besides order and clearness all the artificial and figurative application of words eloquence hath invented are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas move the passions and thereby mislead the judgment and so indeed are perfect cheats and therefore however laudable or allowable oratory may render them in harangues and popular addresses they are certainly in all discourses that pretend to inform or instruct wholly to be avoided and where truth and knowledge are concerned cannot but be thought a great fault either of the language or person that makes use of them what and how various they are will be superfluous here to take notice the books of rhetoric which abound in the world will instruct those who want to be informed only i cannot but observe how little the pres ervation and improvement of truth and knowledge is the care and concern of mankind since the arts of fallacy are endowed and preferred it is evident how much men love to deceive and be deceived since rhetoric that powerful instrument of error and deceit has its established professors is publicly taught and has always been had in great reputation and i doubt not but it will be thought great boldness if not brutality in me to have said thus much against it eloquence like the fair sex has too prevailing beauties in it to suffer itself ever to be spoken against and it is in vain to find fault with those arts of deceiving wherein men find pleasure to be deceived of the remedies of the foregoing imperfections and abuses of words remedies are worth seeking the natural and improved imperfections of languages we have seen above at large and speech being the great bond that holds society together and the common conduit whereby the improvements of knowledge are conveyed from one man and one generation to another it would well deserve our most serious thoughts to consider what remedies are to be found for the inconveniences above mentioned are not easy to find i am not so vain as to think that any one can pretend to attempt the perfect reforming the languages of the world no not so much as of his own country without rendering himself ridiculous to require that men should use their words constantly in the same sense and for none but determined and uniform ideas would be to think that all men should have the same notions and should talk of nothing but what they have clear and distinct ideas of which is not to be expected by any one who hath not vanity enough to imagine he can prevail with men to be very knowing or very silent and he must be very little skilled in the world who thinks that a voluble tongue shall accompany only a good understanding or that mens talking much or little should hold proportion only to their knowledge but yet necessary to those who search after truth but though the market and exchange must be left to their own ways of talking and gossipings not be robbed of their ancient privilege though the schools and men of argument would perhaps take it amiss to have anything offered to abate the length or lessen the number of their disputes yet methinks those who pretend seriously to search after or maintain truth should think themselves obliged to study how they might deliver themselves without obscurity doubtfulness or equivocation to which mens words are naturally liable if care be not taken misuse of words the great cause of errors for he that shall well consider the errors and obscurity the mistakes and confusion that are spread in the world by an ill use of words will find some reason to doubt whether language as it has been employed has contributed more to the improvement or hindrance of knowledge amongst mankind how many are there that when they would think on things fix their thoughts only on words especially when they would apply their minds to moral matters and who then can wonder if the result of such contemplations and reasonings about little more than sounds whilst the ideas they annex to them are very confused and very unsteady or perhaps none at all who can wonder i say that such thoughts and reasonings end in nothing but obscurity and mistake without any clear judgment or knowledge has made men more conceited and obstinate this inconvenience in an ill use of words men suffer in their own private meditations but much more manifest are the disorders which follow from it in conversation discourse and arguings with others for language being the great conduit whereby men convey their discoveries reasonings and knowledge from one to another he that makes an ill use of it though he does not corrupt the fountains of knowledge which are in things themselves yet he does as much as in him lies break or stop the pipes whereby it is distributed to the public use and advantage of mankind he that uses words without any clear and steady meaning what does he but lead himself and others into errors and he that designedly does it ought to be looked on as an enemy to truth and knowl edge and yet who can wonder that all the sciences and parts of knowledge have been so overcharged with obscure and equivocal terms and insignificant and doubtful expressions capable to make the most attentive or quicksighted very little or not at all the more knowing or orthodox since subtlety in those who make profession to teach or defend truth hath passed so much for a virtue a virtue indeed which consisting for the most part in nothing but the fallacious and illusory use of obscure or deceitful terms is only fit to make men more conceited in their ignorance and more obstinate in their errors addicted to wrangling about sounds let us look into the books of controversy of any kind there we shall see that the effect of obscure unsteady or equivocal terms is nothing but noise and wrangling about sounds without convincing or bettering a mans understanding for if the idea be not agreed on betwixt the speaker and hearer for which the words stand the argument is not about things but names as often as such a word whose signification is not ascertained betwixt them comes in use their understandings have no other object wherein they agree but barely the sound the things that they think on at that time as expressed by that word being quite different instance bat and bird whether a bat be a bird or no is not a question whether a bat be another thing than indeed it is or have other qualities than indeed it has for that would be extremely absurd to doubt of but the question is either between those that acknowledged themselves to have but imperfect ideas of one or both of this sort of things for which these names are supposed to stand and then it is a real inquiry concerning the nature of a bird or a bat to make their yet imperfect ideas of it more complete by examining whether all the simple ideas to which combined together they both give the name bird be all to be found in a bat but this is a question only of inquirers not disputers who neither affirm nor deny but examine or it is a question between disputants whereof the one affirms and the other denies that a bat is a bird and then the question is barely about the signification of one or both these words in that they not having both the same complex ideas to which they give these two names one holds and the other denies that these two names may be affirmed one of another were they agreed in the signification of these two names it were impossible they should dispute about them for they would presently and clearly see were that adjusted between them whether all the simple ideas of the more general name bird were found in the complex idea of a bat or no and so there could be no doubt whether a bat were a bird or no and here i desire it may be considered and carefully examined whether the greatest part of the disputes in the world are not merely verbal and about the signification of words and whether if the terms they are made in were defined and reduced in their signification as they must be where they signify anything to determined collections of the simple ideas they do or should stand for those disputes would not end of themselves and immediately vanish i leave it then to be considered what the learning of disputation is and how well they are employed for the advantage of themselves or others whose business is only the vain ostentation of sounds ie those who spend their lives in disputes and controversies when i shall see any of those combatants strip all his terms of ambiguity and obscurity which every one may do in the words he uses himself i shall think him a champion for knowledge truth and peace and not the slave of vainglory ambition or a party remedies to remedy the defects of speech before mentioned to some degree and to prevent the inconveniences that follow from them i imagine the observation of these following rules may be of use till somebody better able shall judge it worth his while to think more maturely on this matter and oblige the world with his thoughts on it first remedy to use no word without an idea annexed to it first a man shall take care to use no word without a signification no name without an idea for which he makes it stand this rule will not seem altogether needless to any one who shall take the pains to recollect how often he has met with such words as instinct sym pathy and antipathy c in the discourse of others so made use of as he might easily conclude that those that used them had no ideas in their minds to which they applied them but spoke them only as sounds which usually served instead of reasons on the like occasions not but that these words and the like have very proper significations in which they may be used but there being no natural connexion between any words and any ideas these and any other may be learned by rote and pronounced or writ by men who have no ideas in their minds to which they have annexed them and for which they make them stand which is necessary they should if men would speak intelligibly even to themselves alone second remedy to have distinct determinate ideas annexed to words especially in mixed modes secondly it is not enough a man uses his words as signs of some ideas those he annexes them to if they be simple must be clear and distinct if complex must be determinate ie the precise collection of simple ideas settled in the mind with that sound annexed to it as the sign of that precise determined collection and no other this is very necessary in names of modes and especially moral words which having no settled objects in nature from whence their ideas are taken as from their original are apt to be very confused justice is a word in every mans mouth but most commonly with a very undertermined loose signification which will always be so unless a man has in his mind a distinct comprehension of the component parts that complex idea consists of and if it be decompounded must be able to resolve it still on till he at last comes to the simple ideas that make it up and unless this be done a man makes an ill use of the word let it be justice for example or any other i do not say a man needs stand to recollect and make this analysis at large every time the word justice comes in his way but this at least is necessary that he have so examined the signification of that name and settled the idea of all its parts in his mind that he can do it when he pleases if any one who makes his complex idea of justice to be such a treatment of the person or goods of another as is according to law hath not a clear and distinct idea what law is which makes a part of his complex idea of justice it is plain his idea of justice itself will be confused and imperfect this exactness will perhaps be judged very troublesome and therefore most men will think they may be excused from settling the complex ideas of mixed modes so precisely in their minds but yet i must say till this be done it must not be wondered that they have a great deal of obscurity and confusion in their own minds and a great deal of wrangling in their discourse with others and distinct and conformable ideas in words that stand for substances in the names of substances for a right use of them something more is required than barely determined ideas in these the names must also be conformable to things as they exist but of this i shall have occasion to speak more at large by and by this exactness is absolutely necessary in inquiries after philosophical knowledge and in controversies about truth and though it would be well too if it extended itself to common conversation and the ordinary affairs of life yet i think that is scarce to be expected vulgar notions suit vulgar discourses and both though confused enough yet serve pretty well the market and the wake merchants and lovers cooks and tailors have words wherewithal to dispatch their ordinary affairs and so i think might philosophers and disputants too if they had a mind to understand and to be clearly understood third remedy to apply words to such ideas as common use has annexed them to thirdly it is not enough that men have ideas determined ideas for which they make these signs stand but they must also take care to apply their words as near as may be to such ideas as common use has annexed them to for words especially of languages already framed being no mans private possession but the common measure of commerce and communication it is not for any one at pleasure to change the stamp they are current in nor alter the ideas they are affixed to or at least when there is a necessity to do so he is bound to give notice of it mens intentions in speaking are or at least should be to be understood which cannot be without frequent explanations demands and other the like incommodious interruptions where men do not follow common use propriety of speech is that which gives our thoughts entrance into other mens minds with the greatest ease and advantage and therefore deserves some part of our care and study especially in the names of moral words the proper signification and use of terms is best to be learned from those who in their writings and discourses appear to have had the clearest notions and applied to them their terms with the exactest choice and fitness this way of using a mans words according to the propriety of the language though it have not always the good fortune to be understood yet most commonly leaves the blame of it on him who is so unskilful in the language he speaks as not to understand it when made use of as it ought to be fourth remedy to declare the meaning in which we use them fourthly but because common use has not so visibly annexed any signification to words as to make men know always certainly what they precisely stand for and because men in the improvement of their knowledge come to have ideas different from the vulgar and ordinary received ones for which they must either make new words which men seldom venture to do for fear of being though guilty of affectation or novelty or else must use old ones in a new signification therefore after the observation of the foregoing rules it is sometimes necessary for the ascertaining the signification of words to declare their meaning where either common use has left it uncertain and loose as it has in most names of very complex ideas or where the term being very material in the discourse and that upon which it chiefly turns is liable to any doubtfulness or mistake and that in three ways as the ideas mens words stand for are of different sorts so the way of making known the ideas they stand for when there is occasion is also different for though defining be thought the proper way to make known the proper signification of words yet there are some words that will not be defined as there are others whose precise meaning cannot be made known but by definition and perhaps a third which partake somewhat of both the other as we shall see in the names of simple ideas modes and substances i in simple ideas either by synonymous terms or by showing examples first when a man makes use of the name of any simple idea which he perceives is not understood or is in danger to be mistaken he is obliged by the laws of ingenuity and the end of speech to declare his meaning and make known what idea he makes it stand for this as has been shown cannot be done by definition and therefore when a synonymous word fails to do it there is but one of these ways left first sometimes the naming the subject wherein that simple idea is to be found will make its name to be understood by those who are acquainted with that subject and know it by that name so to make a countryman understand what feuillemorte colour signifies it may suffice to tell him it is the colour of withered leaves falling in autumn secondly but the only sure way of making known the signification of the name of any simple idea is by presenting to his senses that subject which may produce it in his mind and make him actually have the idea that word stands for ii in mixed modes by definition secondly mixed modes especially those belonging to morality being most of them such combinations of ideas as the mind puts together of its own choice and whereof there are not always standing patterns to be found existing the signification of their names cannot be made known as those of simple ideas by any showing but in recompense thereof may be perfectly and exactly defined for they being combinations of several ideas that the mind of man has arbitrarily put together without reference to any archetypes men may if they please exactly know the ideas that go to each composition and so both use these words in a certain and undoubted signification and perfectly declare when there is occasion what they stand for this if well considered would lay great blame on those who make not their discourses about moral things very clear and distinct for since the precise signification of the names of mixed modes or which is all one the real essence of each species is to be known they being not of natures but mans making it is a great negligence and perverseness to discourse of moral things with uncertainty and obscurity which is more pardonable in treating of natural substances where doubtful terms are hardly to be avoided for a quite contrary reason as we shall see by and by morality capable of demonstration upon this ground it is that i am bold to think that morality is capable of demonstration as well as mathematics since the precise real essence of the things moral words stand for may be perfectly known and so the congruity and incongruity of the things themselves be certainly discovered in which consists perfect knowledge nor let any one object that the names of substances are often to be made use of in morality as well as those of modes from which will arise obscurity for as to substances when concerned in moral discourses their divers natures are not so much inquired into as supposed vg when we say that man is subject to law we mean nothing by man but a corporeal rational creature what the real essence or other qualities of that creature are in this case is no way considered and therefore whether a child or changeling be a man in a physical sense may amongst the naturalists be as disputable as it will it concerns not at all the moral man as i may call him which is this immovable unchangeable idea a corporeal rational being for were there a monkey or any other creature to be found that had the use of reason to such a degree as to be able to understand general signs and to deduce consequences about general ideas he would no doubt be subject to law and in that sense be a man how much soever he differed in shape from others of that name the names of substances if they be used in them as they should can no more disturb moral than they do mathematical discourses where if the mathematician speaks of a cube or globe of gold or of any other body he has his clear settled idea which varies not though it may by mistake be applied to a particular body to which it belongs not definitions can make moral discourses clear this i have here mentioned by the by to show of what consequence it is for men in their names of mixed modes and consequently in all their moral discourses to define their words when there is occasion since thereby moral knowledge may be brought to so great clearness and certainty and it must be great want of ingenuousness to say no worse of it to refuse to do it since a definition is the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral words can be known and yet a way whereby their meaning may be known certainly and without leaving any room for any contest about it and therefore the negligence or perverseness of mankind cannot be excused if their discourses in morality be not much more clear than those in natural philosophy since they are about ideas in the mind which are none of them false or disproportionate they having no external beings for the archetypes which they are referred to and must correspond with it is far easier for men to frame in their minds an idea which shall be the standard to which they will give the name justice with which pattern so made all actions that agree shall pass under that denomination than having seen aristides to frame an idea that shall in all things be exactly like him who is as he is let men make what idea they please of him for the one they need but know the combination of ideas that are put together in their own minds for the other they must inquire into the whole nature and abstruse hidden constitution and various qualities of a thing existing without them and is the only way in which the meaning of mixed modes can be made known another reason that makes the defining of mixed modes so necessary especially of moral words is what i mentioned a little before viz that it is the only way whereby the signification of the most of them can be known with certainty for the ideas they stand for being for the most part such whose component parts nowhere exist together but scattered and mingled with others it is the mind alone that collects them and gives them the union of one idea and it is only by words enumerating the several simple ideas which the mind has united that we can make known to others what their names stand for the assistance of the senses in this case not helping us by the proposal of sensible objects to show the ideas which our names of this kind stand for as it does often in the names of sensible simple ideas and also to some degree in those of substances iii in substances both by showing and by defining thirdly for the explaining the signification of the names of substances as they stand for the ideas we have of their distinct species both the forementioned ways viz of showing and defining are requisite in many cases to be made use of for there being ordinarily in each sort some leading qualities to which we suppose the other ideas which make up our complex idea of that species annexed we forwardly give the specific name to that thing wherein that characteristical mark is found which we take to be the most distinguishing idea of that species these leading or characteristical as i may call them ideas in the sorts of animals and vegetables are as has been before remarked ch vi ss and ch ix ss mostly figure and in inanimate bodies colour and in some both together now ideas of the leading qualities of substances are best got by showing these leading sensible qualities are those which make the chief ingredients of our specific ideas and consequently the most observable and invariable part in the definitions of our specific names as attributed to sorts of substances coming under our knowledge for though the sound man in its own nature be as apt to signify a complex idea made up of animality and rationality united in the same subject as to signify any other combination yet used as a mark to stand for a sort of creatures we count of our own kind perhaps the outward shape is as necessary to be taken into our complex idea signified by the word man as any other we find in it and therefore why platos animal implume bipes latis unguibus should not be a good definition of the name man standing for that sort of creatures will not be easy to show for it is the shape as the leading quality that seems more to determine that species than a faculty of reasoning which appears not at first and in some never and if this be not allowed to be so i do not know how they can be excused from murder who kill monstrous births as we call them because of an unordinary shape without knowing whether they have a rational soul or no which can be no more discerned in a wellformed than illshaped infant as soon as born and who is it has informed us that a rational soul can inhabit no tenement unless it has just such a sort of frontispiece or can join itself to and inform no sort of body but one that is just of such an outward structure and can hardly be made known otherwise now these leading qualities are best made known by showing and can hardly be made known otherwise for the shape of a horse or cassowary will be but rudely and imperfectly imprinted on the mind by words the sight of the animals doth it a thousand times better and the idea of the particular colour of gold is not to be got by any description of it but only by the frequent exercise of the eyes about it as is evident in those who are used to this metal who will frequently distinguish true from counterfeit pure from adulterate by the sight where others who have as good eyes but yet by use have not got the precise nice idea of that peculiar yellow shall not perceive any difference the like may be said of those other simple ideas peculiar in their kind to any substance for which precise ideas there are no peculiar names the particular ringing sound there is in gold distinct from the sound of other bodies has no particular name annexed to it no more than the particular yellow that belongs to that metal the ideas of the powers of substances are best known by definition but because many of the simple ideas that make up our specific ideas of substances are powers which lie not obvious to our senses in the things as they ordinarily appear therefore in the signification of our names of substances some part of the signification will be better made known by enumerating those simple ideas than by showing the substance itself for he that to the yellow shining colour of gold got by sight shall from my enumerating them have the ideas of great ductility fusibility fixedness and solubility in aqua regia will have a perfecter idea of gold than he can have by seeing a piece of gold and thereby imprinting in his mind only its obvious qualities but if the formal constitution of this shining heavy ductile thing from whence all these its properties flow lay open to our senses as the formal constitution or essence of a triangle does the signification of the word gold might as easily be ascertained as that of triangle a reflection on the knowledge of corporeal things possessed by spirits separate from bodies hence we may take notice how much the foundation of all our knowl edge of corporeal things lies in our senses for how spirits separate from bodies whose knowledge and ideas of these things are certainly much more perfect than ours know them we have no notion no idea at all the whole extent of our knowledge or imagination reaches not beyond our own ideas limited to our ways of perception though yet it be not to be doubted that spirits of a higher rank than those immersed in flesh may have as clear ideas of the radical constitution of substances as we have of a triangle and so perceive how all their properties and operations flow from thence but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceeds our conceptions iv ideas of substances must be conformable to things fourthly but though definitions will serve to explain the names of substances as they stand for our ideas yet they leave them not without great imperfection as they stand for things for our names of substances being not put barely for our ideas but being made use of ultimately to represent things and so are put in their place their signification must agree with the truth of things as well as with mens ideas and therefore in substances we are not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly received as the signification of that word but must go a little further and inquire into the nature and properties of the things themselves and thereby perfect as much as we can our ideas of their distinct species or else learn them from such as are used to that sort of things and are experienced in them for since it is intended their names should stand for such collections of simple ideas as do really exist in things themselves as well as for the complex idea in other mens minds which in their ordinary acceptation they stand for therefore to define their names right natural history is to be inquired into and their properties are with care and examination to be found out for it is not enough for the avoiding inconveniences in discourse and arguings about natural bodies and substantial things to have learned from the propriety of the language the common but confused or very imperfect idea to which each word is applied and to keep them to that idea in our use of them but we must by acquainting ourselves with the history of that sort of things rectify and settle our complex idea belonging to each specific name and in discourse with others if we find them mistake us we ought to tell what the complex idea is that we make such a name stand for this is the more necessary to be done by all those who search after knowledge and philosophical verity in that children being taught words whilst they have but imperfect notions of things apply them at random and without much thinking and seldom frame determined ideas to be signified by them which custom it being easy and serving well enough for the ordinary affairs of life and conversation they are apt to continue when they are men and so begin at the wrong end learning words first and perfectly but make the notions to which they apply those words afterwards very overtly by this means it comes to pass that men speaking the language of their country ie according to grammar rules of that language do yet speak very improperly of things themselves and by their arguing one with another make but small progress in the discoveries of useful truths and the knowledge of things as they are to be found in themselves and not in our imaginations and it matters not much for the improvement of our knowledge how they are called not easy to be made so it were therefore to be wished that men versed in physical inquiries and acquainted with the several sorts of natural bodies would set down those simple ideas wherein they observe the individuals of each sort constantly to agree this would remedy a great deal of that confusion which comes from several persons applying the same name to a collection of a smaller or greater number of sensible qualities proportionably as they have been more or less acquainted with or accurate in examining the qualities of any sort of things which come under one denomination but a dictionary of this sort containing as it were a natural history requires too many hands as well as too much time cost pains and sagacity ever to be hoped for and till that be done we must content ourselves with such definitions of the names of substances as explain the sense men use them in and it would be well where there is occasion if they would afford us so much this yet is not usually done but men talk to one another and dispute in words whose meaning is not agreed between them out of a mistake that the significations of common words are certainly established and the precise ideas they stand for perfectly known and that it is a shame to be ignorant of them both which suppositions are false no names of complex ideas having so settled determined significations that they are constantly used for the same precise ideas nor is it a shame for a man not to have a certain knowledge of anything but by the necessary ways of attaining it and so it is no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stands for in another mans mind without he declare it to me by some other way than barely using that sound there being no other way without such a declaration certainly to know it indeed the necessity of communication by language brings men to an agreement in the signification of common words within some tolerable latitude that may serve for ordinary conversation and so a man cannot be supposed wholly ignorant of the ideas which are annexed to words by common use in a language familiar to him but common use being but a very uncertain rule which reduces itself at last to the ideas of particular men proves often but a very variable standard but though such a dictionary as i have above mentioned will require too much time cost and pains to be hoped for in this age yet methinks it is not unreasonable to propose that words standing for things which are known and distinguished by their outward shapes should be expressed by little draughts and prints made of them a vocabulary made after this fashion would perhaps with more ease and in less time teach the true signification of many terms especially in languages of remote countries or ages and settle truer ideas in mens minds of several things whereof we read the names in ancient authors than all the large and laborious comments of learned critics naturalists that treat of plants and animals have found the benefit of this way and he that has had occasion to consult them will have reason to confess that he has a clearer idea of apium or ibex from a little print of that herb or beast than he could have from a long definition of the names of either of them and so no doubt he would have of strigil and sistrum if instead of currycomb and cymbal which are the english names dictionaries render them by he could see stamped in the margin small pictures of these instruments as they were in use amongst the ancients toga tunica pallium are words easily translated by gown coat and cloak but we have thereby no more true ideas of the fashion of those habits amongst the romans than we have of the faces of the tailors who made them such things as these which the eye distinguishes by their shapes would be best let into the mind by draughts made of them and more determine the signification of such words than any other words set for them or made use of to define them but this is only by the bye v fifth remedy to use the same word constantly in the same sense fifthly if men will not be at the pains to declare the meaning of their words and definitions of their terms are not to be had yet this is the least that can be expected that in all discourses wherein one man pretends to instruct or convince another he should use the same word constantly in the same sense if this were done which nobody can refuse without great disingenuity many of the books extant might be spared many of the controversies in dispute would be at an end several of those great volumes swollen with ambiguous words now used in one sense and by and by in another would shrink into a very narrow compass and many of the philosophers to mention no other as well as poets works might be contained in a nutshell when not so used the variation is to he explained but after all the provision of words is so scanty in respect to that infinite variety of thoughts that men wanting terms to suit their precise notions will notwithstanding their utmost caution be forced often to use the same word in somewhat different senses and though in the continuation of a discourse or the pursuit of an argument there can be hardly room to digress into a particular definition as often as a man varies the signification of any term yet the import of the discourse will for the most part if there be no designed fallacy sufficiently lead candid and intelligent readers into the true meaning of it but where there is not sufficient to guide the reader there it concerns the writer to explain his meaning and show in what sense he there uses that term of knowledge and probability of knowledge in general our knowledge conversant about our ideas only since the mind in all its thoughts and reasonings hath no other immediate object but its own ideas which it alone does or can contemplate it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas knowledge then seems to me to be nothing but the perception of the connexion of and agreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas in this alone it consists where this perception is there is knowledge and where it is not there though we may fancy guess or believe yet we always come short of knowledge for when we know that white is not black what do we else but perceive that these two ideas do not agree when we possess ourselves with the utmost security of the demonstration that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones what do we more but perceive that equality to two right ones does necessarily agree to and is inseparable from the three angles of a triangle this agreement or disagreement may be any of four sorts but to understand a little more distinctly wherein this agreement or disagreement consists i think we may reduce it all to these four sorts i identity or diversity ii relation iii coexistence or necessary connexion iv real existence of identity or diversity in ideas first as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement viz identity or diversity it is the first act of the mind when it has any sentiments or ideas at all to perceive its ideas and so far as it perceives them to know each what it is and thereby also to perceive their difference and that one is not another this is so absolutely necessary that without it there could be no knowledge no reasoning no imagination no distinct thoughts at all by this the mind clearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself and to be what it is and all distinct ideas to disagree ie the one not to be the other and this it does without pains labour or deduction but at first view by its natural power of perception and distinction and though men of art have reduced this into those general rules what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be for ready application in all cases wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it yet it is certain that the first exercise of this faculty is about particular ideas a man infallibly knows as soon as ever he has them in his mind that the ideas he calls white and round are the very ideas they are and that they are not other ideas which he calls red or square nor can any maxim or proposition in the world make him know it clearer or surer than he did before and without any such general rule this then is the first agreement or disagreement which the mind perceives in its ideas which it always perceives at first sight and if there ever happen any doubt about it it will always be found to be about the names and not the ideas themselves whose identity and diversity will always be perceived as soon and clearly as the ideas themselves are nor can it possibly be otherwise of abstract relations between ideas secondly the next sort of agreement or disagreement the mind perceives in any of its ideas may i think be called relative and is nothing but the perception of the relation between any two ideas of what kind soever whether substances modes or any other for since all distinct ideas must eternally be known not to be the same and so be universally and constantly denied one of another there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all if we could not perceive any relation between our ideas and find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with another in several ways the mind takes of comparing them of their necessary coexistence in substances thirdly the third sort of agreement or disagreement to be found in our ideas which the perception of the mind is employed about is coexistence or noncoexistence in the same subject and this belongs particularly to substances thus when we pronounce concerning gold that it is fixed our knowledge of this truth amounts to no more but this that fixedness or a power to remain in the fire unconsumed is an idea that always accompanies and is joined with that particular sort of yellowness weight fusibility malleableness and solubility in aqua regia which make our complex idea signified by the word gold of real existence agreeing to any idea fourthly the fourth and last sort is that of actual real existence agreeing to any idea within these four sorts of agreement or disagreement is i suppose contained all the knowledge we have or are capable of for all the inquiries we can make concerning any of our ideas all that we know or can affirm concerning any of them is that it is or is not the same with some other that it does or does not always coexist with some other idea in the same subject that it has this or that relation with some other idea or that it has a real existence without the mind thus blue is not yellow is of identity two triangles upon equal bases between two parallels are equal is of relation iron is susceptible of magnetical impressions is of coexistence god is is of real existence though identity and coexistence are truly nothing but relations yet they are such peculiar ways of agreement or disagreement of our ideas that they deserve well to be considered as distinct heads and not under relation in general since they are so different grounds of affirmation and negation as will easily appear to any one who will but reflect on what is said in several places of this essay i should now proceed to examine the several degrees of our knowledge but that it is necessary first to consider the different acceptations of the word knowledge knowledge is either actual or habitual there are several ways wherein the mind is possessed of truth each of which is called knowledge i there is actual knowledge which is the present view the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas or of the relation they have one to another ii a man is said to know any proposition which having been once laid before his thoughts he evidently perceived the agreement or disagreement of the ideas whereof it consists and so lodged it in his memory that whenever that proposition comes again to be reflected on he without doubt or hesitation embraces the right side assents to and is certain of the truth of it this i think one may call habitual knowledge and thus a man may be said to know all those truths which are lodged in his memory by a foregoing clear and full perception whereof the mind is assured past doubt as often as it has occasion to reflect on them for our finite understandings being able to think clearly and distinctly but on one thing at once if men had no knowledge of any more than what they actually thought on they would all be very ignorant and he that knew most would know but one truth that being all he was able to think on at one time habitual knowledge is of two degrees of habitual knowledge there are also vulgarly speaking two degrees first the one is of such truths laid up in the memory as whenever they occur to the mind it actually perceives the relation is between those ideas and this is in all those truths whereof we have an intuitive knowledge where the ideas themselves by an immediate view discover their agreement or disagreement one with another secondly the other is of such truths whereof the mind having been convinced it retains the memory of the conviction without the proofs thus a man that remembers certainly that he once perceived the demonstration that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones is certain that he knows it because he cannot doubt the truth of it in his adherence to a truth where the demonstration by which it was at first known is forgot though a man may be thought rather to believe his memory than really to know and this way of entertaining a truth seemed formerly to me like something between opinion and knowledge a sort of assurance which exceeds bare belief for that relies on the testimony of anotheryet upon a due examination i find it comes not short of perfect certainty and is in effect true knowledge that which is apt to mislead our first thoughts into a mistake in this matter is that the agreement or disagreement of the ideas in this case is not perceived as it was at first by an actual view of all the intermediate ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement of those in the proposition was at first perceived but by other intermediate ideas that show the agreement or disagreement of the ideas contained in the proposition whose certainty we remember for example in this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones one who has seen and clearly perceived the demonstration of this truth knows it to be true when that demonstration is gone out of his mind so that at present it is not actually in view and possibly cannot be recollected but he knows it in a different way from what he did before the agreement of the two ideas joined in that proposition is perceived but it is by the intervention of other ideas than those which at first produced that perception he remembers ie he knows for remembrance is but the reviving of some past knowledge that he was once certain of the truth of this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones the immutability of the same relations between the same immutable things is now the idea that shows him that if the three angles of a triangle were once equal to two right ones they will always be equal to two right ones and hence he comes to be certain that what was once true in the case is always true what ideas once agreed will always agree and consequently what he once knew to be true he will always know to be true as long as he can remember that he once knew it upon this ground it is that particular demonstrations in mathematics afford general knowledge if then the perception that the same ideas will eternally have the same habitudes and relations be not a sufficient ground of knowledge there could be no knowledge of general propositions in mathematics for no mathematical demonstration would be any other than particular and when a man had demonstrated any proposition concerning one triangle or circle his knowledge would not reach beyond that particular diagram if he would extend it further he must renew his demonstration in another instance before he could know it to be true in another like triangle and so on by which means one could never come to the knowledge of any general propositions nobody i think can deny that mr newton certainly knows any proposition that he now at any time reads in his book to be true though he has not in actual view that admirable chain of intermediate ideas whereby he at first discovered it to be true such a memory as that able to retain such a train of particulars may be well thought beyond the reach of human faculties when the very discovery perception and laying together that wonderful connexion of ideas is found to surpass most readers comprehension but yet it is evident the author himself knows the proposition to be true remembering he once saw the connexion of those ideas as certainly as he knows such a man wounded another remembering that he saw him run him through but because the memory is not always so clear as actual perception and does in all men more or less decay in length of time this amongst other differences is one which shows that demonstrative knowledge is much more imperfect than intuitive as we shall see in the following chapter of the degrees of our knowledge of the degrees or differences in clearness of our knowledge intuitive all our knowledge consisting as i have said in the view the mind has of its own ideas which is the utmost light and greatest certainty we with our faculties and in our way of knowledge are capable of it may not be amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence the different clearness of our knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas for if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking we will find that sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately by themselves without the intervention of any other and this i think we may call intuitive knowledge for in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining but perceives the truth as the eye doth light only by being directed towards it thus the mind perceives that white is not black that a circle is not a triangle that three are more than two and equal to one and two such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together by bare intuition without the intervention of any other idea and this kind of knowledge is the clearest and most certain that human frailty is capable of this part of knowledge is irresistible and like bright sunshine forces itself immediately to be perceived as soon as ever the mind turns its view that way and leaves no room for hesitation doubt or examination but the mind is presently filled with the clear light of it it is on this intuition that depends all the certainty and evidence of all our knowledge which certainty every one finds to be so great that he cannot imagine and therefore not require a greater for a man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater certainty than to know that any idea in his mind is such as he perceives it to be and that two ideas wherein he perceives a difference are different and not precisely the same he that demands a greater certainty than this demands he knows not what and shows only that he has a mind to be a sceptic without being able to be so certainty depends so wholly on this intuition that in the next degree of knowledge which i call demonstrative this intuition is necessary in all the connexions of the intermediate ideas without which we cannot attain knowledge and certainty ii demonstrative the next degree of knowledge is where the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of any ideas but not immediately though wherever the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas there be certain knowledge yet it does not always happen that the mind sees that agreement or disagreement which there is between them even where it is discoverable and in that case remains in ignorance and at most gets no further than a probable conjecture the reason why the mind cannot always perceive presently the agreement or disagreement of two ideas is because those ideas concerning whose agreement or disagreement the inquiry is made cannot by the mind be so put together as to show it in this case then when the mind cannot so bring its ideas together as by their immediate comparison and as it were juxtaposition or application one to another to perceive their agreement or disagreement it is fain by the intervention of other ideas one or more as it happens to discover the agreement or disagreement which it searches and this is that which we call reasoning thus the mind being willing to know the agreement or disagreement in bigness between the three angles of a triangle and two right ones cannot by an immediate view and comparing them do it because the three angles of a triangle cannot be brought at once and be compared with any other one or two angles and so of this the mind has no immediate no intuitive knowledge in this case the mind is fain to find out some other angles to which the three angles of a triangle have an equality and finding those equal to two right ones comes to know their equality to two right ones demonstration depends on clearly perceived proofs those intervening ideas which serve to show the agreement of any two others are called proofs and where the agreement and disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived it is called demonstration it being shown to the understanding and the mind made to see that it is so a quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate ideas that shall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other and to apply them right is i suppose that which is called sagacity as certain but not so easy and ready as intuitive knowledge this knowledge by intervening proofs though it be certain yet the evidence of it is not altogether so clear and bright nor the assent so ready as in intuitive knowledge for though in demonstration the mind does at last perceive the agreement or disagreement of the ideas it considers yet it is not without pains and attention there must be more than one transient view to find it a steady application and pursuit are required to this discovery and there must be a progression by steps and degrees before the mind can in this way arrive at certainty and come to perceive the agreement or repugnancy between two ideas that need proofs and the use of reason to show it the demonstrated conclusion not without doubt precedent to the demonstration another difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge is that though in the latter all doubt be removed when by the intervention of the intermediate ideas the agreement or disagreement is perceived yet before the demonstration there was a doubt which in intuitive knowledge cannot happen to the mind that has its faculty of perception left to a degree capable of distinct ideas no more than it can be a doubt to the eye that can distinctly see white and black whether this ink and this paper be all of a colour if there be sight in the eyes it will at first glimpse without hesitation perceive the words printed on this paper different from the colour of the paper and so if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception it will perceive the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that produce intuitive knowledge if the eyes have lost the faculty of seeing or the mind of perceiving we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one or clearness of perception in the other not so clear as intuitive knowledge it is true the perception produced by demonstration is also very clear yet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance that always accompany that which i call intuitive like a face reflected by several mirrors one to another where as long as it retains the similitude and agreement with the object it produces a knowledge but it is still in every successive reflection with a lessening of that perfect clearness and distinctness which is in the first till at last after many removes it has a great mixture of dimness and is not at first sight so knowable especially to weak eyes thus it is with knowledge made out by a long train of proof each step in demonstrated knowledge must have intuitive evidence now in every step reason makes in demonstrative knowledge there is an intuitive knowledge of that agreement or disagreement it seeks with the next intermediate idea which it uses as a proof for if it were not so that yet would need a proof since without the perception of such agreement or disagreement there is no knowledge produced if it be perceived by itself it is intuitive knowledge if it cannot be perceived by itself there is need of some intervening idea as a common measure to show their agreement or disagreement by which it is plain that every step in reasoning that produces knowledge has intuitive certainty which when the mind perceives there is no more required but to remember it to make the agreement or disagreement of the ideas concerning which we inquire visible and certain so that to make anything a demonstration it is necessary to perceive the immediate agreement of the intervening ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement of the two ideas under examination whereof the one is always the first and the other the last in the account is found this intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step and progression of the demonstration must also be carried exactly in the mind and a man must be sure that no part is left out which because in long deductions and the use of many proofs the memory does not always so readily and exactly retain therefore it comes to pass that this is more imperfect than intuitive knowledge and men embrace often falsehood for demonstrations hence the mistake ex praecognitis et praeconcessis the necessity of this intuitive knowledge in each step of scientifical or demonstrative reasoning gave occasion i imagine to that mistaken axiom that all reasoning was ex pracognitis et praeconcessis which how far it is a mistake i shall have occasion to show more at large when i come to consider propositions and particularly those propositions which are called maxims and to show that it is by a mistake that they are supposed to be the foundations of all our knowledge and reasonings demonstration not limited to ideas of mathematical quantity it has been generally taken for granted that mathematics alone are capable of demonstrative certainty but to have such an agreement or disagreement as may intuitively be perceived being as i imagine not the privilege of the ideas of number extension and figure alone it may possibly be the want of due method and application in us and not of sufficient evidence in things that demonstration has been thought to have so little to do in other parts of knowledge and been scarce so much as aimed at by any but mathematicians for whatever ideas we have wherein the mind can perceive the immediate agreement or disagreement that is between them there the mind is capable of intuitive knowledge and where it can perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by an intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement they have with any intermediate ideas there the mind is capable of demonstration which is not limited to ideas of extension figure number and their modes why it has been thought to be so limited the reason why it has been generally sought for and supposed to be only in those i imagine has been not only the general usefulness of those sciences but because in comparing their equality or excess the modes of numbers have every the least difference very clear and perceivable and though in extension every the least excess is not so perceptible yet the mind has found out ways to examine and discover demonstratively the just equality of two angles or extensions or figures and both these ie numbers and figures can be set down by visible and lasting marks wherein the ideas under consideration are perfectly determined which for the most part they are not where they are marked only by names and words modes of qualities not demonstrable like modes of quantity but in other simple ideas whose modes and differences are made and counted by degrees and not quantity we have not so nice and accurate a distinction of their differences as to perceive or find ways to measure their just equality or the least differences for those other simple ideas being appearances of sensations produced in us by the size figure number and motion of minute corpuscles singly insensible their different degrees also depend upon the variation of some or of all those causes which since it cannot be observed by us in particles of matter whereof each is too subtile to be perceived it is impossible for us to have any exact measures of the different degrees of these simple ideas for supposing the sensation or idea we name whiteness be produced in us by a certain number of globules which having a verticity about their own centres strike upon the retina of the eye with a certain degree of rotation as well as progressive swiftness it will hence easily follow that the more the superficial parts of any body are so ordered as to reflect the greater number of globules of light and to give them the proper rotation which is fit to produce this sensation of white in us the more white will that body appear that from an equal space sends to the retina the greater number of such corpuscles with that peculiar sort of motion i do not say that the nature of light consists in very small round globules nor of whiteness in such a texture of parts as gives a certain rotation to these globules when it reflects them for i am not now treating physically of light or colours but this i think i may say that i cannot and i would be glad any one would make intelligible that he did conceive how bodies without us can any ways affect our senses but by the immediate contact of the sensible bodies themselves as in tasting and feeling or the impulse of some sensible particles coming from them as in seeing hearing and smelling by the different impulse of which parts caused by their different size figure and motion the variety of sensations is produced in us particles of light and simple ideas of colour whether then they be globules or no or whether they have a verticity about their own centres that produces the idea of whiteness in us this is certain that the more particles of light are reflected from a body fitted to give them that peculiar motion which produces the sensation of whiteness in us and possibly too the quicker that peculiar motion isthe whiter does the body appear from which the greatest number are reflected as is evident in the same piece of paper put in the sunbeams in the shade and in a dark hole in each of which it will produce in us the idea of whiteness in far different degrees the secondary qualities of things not discovered by demonstration not knowing therefore what number of particles nor what motion of them is fit to produce any precise degree of whiteness we cannot demonstrate the certain equality of any two degrees of whiteness because we have no certain standard to measure them by nor means to distinguish every the least real difference the only help we have being from our senses which in this point fail us but where the difference is so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct ideas whose differences can be perfectly retained there these ideas or colours as we see in different kinds as blue and red are as capable of demonstration as ideas of number and extension what i have here said of whiteness and colours i think holds true in all secondary qualities and their modes sensitive knowledge of the particular existence of finite beings without us these two viz intuition and demonstration are the degrees of our knowledge whatever comes short of one of these with what assurance soever embraced is but faith or opinion but not knowledge at least in all general truths there is indeed another perception of the mind employed about the particular existence of finite beings without us which going beyond bare probability and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the foregoing degrees of certainty passes under the name of knowledge there can be nothing more certain than that the idea we receive from an external object is in our minds this is intuitive knowledge but whether there be anything more than barely that idea in our minds whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of anything without us which corresponds to that idea is that whereof some men think there may be a question made because men may have such ideas in their minds when no such thing exists no such object affects their senses but yet here i think we are provided with an evidence that puts us past doubting for i ask any one whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different perception when he looks on the sun by day and thinks on it by night when he actually tastes wormwood or smells a rose or only thinks on that savour or odour we as plainly find the difference there is between any idea revived in our minds by our own memory and actually coming into our minds by our senses as we do between any two distinct ideas if any one say a dream may do the same thing and all these ideas may be produced in us with out any external objects he may please to dream that i make him this answer that it is no great matter whether i remove his scruple or no where all is but dream reasoning and arguments are of no use truth and knowledge nothing that i believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dreaming of being in the fire and being actually in it but yet if he be resolved to appear so sceptical as to maintain that what i call being actually in the fire is nothing but a dream and that we cannot thereby certainly know that any such thing as fire actually exists without us i answer that we certainly finding that pleasure or pain follows upon the application of certain objects to us whose existence we perceive or dream that we perceive by our senses this certainty is as great as our happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment to know or to be so that i think we may add to the two former sorts of knowledge this also of the existence of particular external objects by that perception and consciousness we have of the actual entrance of ideas from them and allow these three degrees of knowledge viz intuitive demonstrative and sensitive in each of which there are different degrees and ways of evidence and certainty knowledge not always clear where the ideas that enter into it are clear but since our knowledge is founded on and employed about our ideas only will it not follow from thence that it is conformable to our ideas and that where our ideas are clear and distinct or obscure and confused our knowledge will be so too to which i answer no for our knowledge consisting in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas its clearness or obscurity consists in the clearness or obscurity of that perception and not in the clearness or obscurity of the ideas themselves vg a man that has as clear ideas of the angles of a triangle and of equality to two right ones as any mathematician in the world may yet have but a very obscure perception of their agreement and so have but a very obscure knowledge of it but ideas which by reason of their obscurity or otherwise are confused cannot produce any clear or distinct knowledge because as far as any ideas are confused so far the mind cannot perceive clearly whether they agree or disagree or to express the same thing in a way less apt to be misunderstood he that hath not determined ideas to the words he uses cannot make propositions of them of whose truth he can be certain of the extent of human knowledge extent of our knowledge knowledge as has been said lying in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas it follows from hence that it extends no further than we have ideas first we can have knowledge no further than we have ideas it extends no further than we can perceive their agreement or disagreement secondly that we can have no knowledge further than we can have perception of that agreement or disagreement which perception being either by intuition or the immediate comparing any two ideas or by reason examining the agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of some others or by sensation perceiving the existence of particular things hence it also follows intuitive knowledge extends itself not to all the relations of all our ideas thirdly that we cannot have an intuitive knowledge that shall extend itself to all our ideas and all that we would know about them because we cannot examine and perceive all the relations they have one to another by juxtaposition or an immediate comparison one with another thus having the ideas of an obtuse and an acute angled triangle both drawn from equal bases and between parallels i can by intuitive knowledge perceive the one not to be the other but cannot that way know whether they be equal or no because their agreement or disagreement in equality can never be perceived by an immediate comparing them the difference of figure makes their parts incapable of an exact immediate application and therefore there is need of some intervening qualities to measure them by which is demonstration or rational knowledge nor does demonstrative knowledge fourthly it follows also from what is above observed that our ratio nal knowledge cannot reach to the whole extent of our ideas because between two different ideas we would examine we cannot always find such mediums as we can connect one to another with an intuitive knowledge in all the parts of the deduction and wherever that fails we come short of knowledge and demonstration sensitive knowledge narrower than either fifthly sensitive knowledge reaching no further than the existence of things actually present to our senses is yet much narrower than either of the former our knowledge therefore narrower than our ideas sixthly from all which it is evident that the extent of our knowledge comes not only short of the reality of things but even of the extent of our own ideas though our knowledge be limited to our ideas and cannot exceed them either in extent or perfection and though these be very narrow bounds in respect of the extent of allbeing and far short of what we may justly imagine to be in some even created understandings not tied down to the dull and narrow information that is to be received from some few and not very acute ways of perception such as are our senses yet it would be well with us if our knowledge were but as large as our ideas and there were not many doubts and inquiries concerning the ideas we have whereof we are not nor i believe ever shall be in this world resolved nevertheless i do not question but that human knowledge under the present circumstances of our beings and constitutions may be carried much further than it has hitherto been if men would sincerely and with freedom of mind employ all that industry and labour of thought in improving the means of discovering truth which they do for the colouring or support of falsehood to maintain a system interest or party they are once engaged in but yet after all i think i may without injury to human perfection be confident that our knowledge would never reach to all we might desire to know concerning those ideas we have nor be able to surmount all the difficulties and resolve all the questions that might arise concerning any of them we have the ideas of a square a circle and equality and yet perhaps shall never be able to find a circle equal to a square and certainly know that it is so we have the ideas of matter and thinking but possibly shall never be able to know whether any mere material being thinks or no it being impossible for us by the contemplation of our own ideas without revelation to discover whether omnipotency has not given to some systems of matter fitly disposed a power to perceive and think or else joined and fixed to matter so disposed a thinking immaterial substance it being in respect of our notions not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that god can if he pleases superadd to matter a faculty of thinking than that he should superadd to it another substance with a faculty of thinking since we know not wherein thinking consists nor to what sort of substances the almighty has been pleased to give that power which cannot be in any created being but merely by the good pleasure and bounty of the creator whether matter may not be made by god to think is more than man can know for i see no contradiction in it that the first eternal thinking being or omnipotent spirit should if he pleased give to certain systems of created senseless matter put together as he thinks fit some degrees of sense perception and thought though as i think i have proved bk iv ch ss c it is no less than a contradiction to suppose matter which is evidently in its own nature void of sense and thought should be that eternal firstthinking being what certainty of knowledge can any one have that some perceptions such as vg pleasure and pain should not be in some bodies themselves after a certain manner modified and moved as well as that they should be in an immaterial substance upon the motion of the parts of body body as far as we can conceive being able only to strike and affect body and motion according to the utmost reach of our ideas being able to produce nothing but motion so that when we allow it to produce pleasure or pain or the idea of a colour or sound we are fain to quit our reason go beyond our ideas and attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of our maker for since we must allow he has annexed effects to motion which we can no way conceive motion able to pro duce what reason have we to conclude that he could not order them as well to be produced in a subject we cannot conceive capable of them as well as in a subject we cannot conceive the motion of matter can any way operate upon i say not this that i would any way lessen the belief of the souls immateriality i am not here speaking of probability but knowledge and i think not only that it becomes the modesty of philosophy not to pronounce magisterially where we want that evidence that can produce knowledge but also that it is of use to us to discern how far our knowledge does reach for the state we are at present in not being that of vision we must in many things content ourselves with faith and probability and in the present question about the immateriality of the soul if our faculties cannot arrive at demonstrative certainty we need not think it strange all the great ends of morality and religion are well enough secured without philosophical proofs of the souls immateriality since it is evident that he who made us at the beginning to subsist here sensible intelligent beings and for several years continued us in such a state can and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another world and make us capable there to receive the retribution he has designed to men according to their doings in this life and therefore it is not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other as some overzealous for or against the immateriality of the soul have been forward to make the world believe who either on the one side indulging too much their thoughts immersed altogether in matter can allow no existence to what is not material or who on the other side finding not cogitation within the natural powers of matter examined over and over again by the utmost intention of mind have the confidence to conclude that omnipotency itself cannot give perception and thought to a substance which has the modification of solidity he that considers how hardly sensation is in our thoughts reconcilable to extended matter or existence to anything that has no extension at all will confess that he is very far from certainly knowing what his soul is it is a point which seems to me to be put out of the reach of our knowledge and he who will give him self leave to consider freely and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the souls materiality since on which side soever he views it either as an unextended substance or as a thinking extended matter the difficulty to conceive either will whilst either alone is in his thoughts still drive him to the contrary side an unfair way which some men take with themselves who because of the inconceivableness of something they find in one throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis though altogether as unintelligible to an unbiassed understanding this serves not only to show the weakness and the scantiness of our knowledge but the insignificant triumph of such sort of arguments which drawn from our own views may satisfy us that we can find no certainty on one side of the question but do not at all thereby help us to truth by running into the opposite opinion which on examination will be found clogged with equal difficulties for what safety what advantage to any one is it for the avoiding the seeming absurdities and to him unsurmountable rubs he meets with in one opinion to take refuge in the contrary which is built on something altogether as inexplicable and as far remote from his comprehension it is past controversy that we have in us something that thinks our very doubts about what it is confirm the certainty of its being though we must content ourselves in the ignorance of what kind of being it is and it is in vain to go about to be sceptical in this as it is unreasonable in most other cases to be positive against the being of anything because we cannot comprehend its nature for i would fain know what substance exists that has not something in it which manifestly baffles our understandings other spirits who see and know the nature and inward constitution of things how much must they exceed us in knowledge to which if we add larger comprehension which enables them at one glance to see the connexion and agreement of very many ideas and readily supplies to them the intermediate proofs which we by single and slow steps and long poring in the dark hardly at last find out and are often ready to forget one before we have hunted out another we may guess at some part of the happiness of superior ranks of spirits who have a quicker and more penetrating sight as well as a larger field of knowledge but to return to the argument in hand our knowledge i say is not only limited to the paucity and imperfections of the ideas we have and which we employ it about but even comes short of that too but how far it reaches let us now inquire how far our knowledge reaches the affirmations or negations we make concerning the ideas we have may as i have before intimated in general be reduced to these four sorts viz identity coexistence relation and real existence i shall examine how far our knowledge extends in each of these our knowledge of identity and diversity in ideas extends as far as our ideas themselves first as to identity and diversity in this way of agreement or disagreement of our ideas our intuitive knowledge is as far extended as our ideas themselves and there can be no idea in the mind which it does not presently by an intuitive knowledge perceive to be what it is and to be different from any other of their coexistence extends only a very little way secondly as to the second sort which is the agreement or disagreement of our ideas in coexistence in this our knowledge is very short though in this consists the greatest and most material part of our knowledge concerning substances for our ideas of the species of substances being as i have showed nothing but certain collections of simple ideas united in one subject and so coexisting together vg our idea of flame is a body hot luminous and moving upward of gold a body heavy to a certain degree yellow malleable and fusible for these or some such complex ideas as these in mens minds do these two names of the different substances flame and gold stand for when we would know anything further concerning these or any other sort of substances what do we inquire but what other qualities or powers these substances have or have not which is nothing else but to know what other simple ideas do or do not coexist with those that make up that complex idea because the connexion between simple ideas in substances is for the most part unknown this how weighty and considerable a part soever of human science is yet very narrow and scarce any at all the reason whereof is that the simple ideas whereof our complex ideas of substances are made up are for the most part such as carry with them in their own nature no visible necessary connexion or inconsistency with any other simple ideas whose coexistence with them we would inform ourselves about especially of the secondary qualities of bodies the ideas that our complex ones of substances are made up of and about which our knowledge concerning substances is most employed are those of their secondary qualities which depending all as has been shown upon the primary qualities of their minute and insensible parts or if not upon them upon something yet more remote from our comprehension it is impossible we should know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another for not knowing the root they spring from not knowing what size figure and texture of parts they are on which depend and from which result those qualities which make our complex idea of gold it is impossible we should know what other qualities result from or are incompatible with the same constitution of the insensible parts of gold and so consequently must always coexist with that complex idea we have of it or else are inconsistent with it because necessary connexion between any secondary and the primary qualities is undiscoverable by us besides this ignorance of the primary qualities of the insensible parts of bodies on which depend all their secondary qualities there is yet another and more incurable part of ignorance which sets us more remote from a certain knowledge of the coexistence or incoexistence if i may so say of different ideas in the same subject and that is that there is no discoverable connexion between any secondary quality and those primary qualities which it depends on we have no perfect knowledge of their primary qualities that the size figure and motion of one body should cause a change in the size figure and motion of an other body is not beyond our conception the separation of the parts of one body upon the intrusion of another and the change from rest to motion upon impulse these and the like seem to have some connexion one with another and if we knew these primary qualities of bodies we might have reason to hope we might be able to know a great deal more of these operations of them one upon another but our minds not being able to discover any connexion betwixt these primary qualities of bodies and the sensations that are produced in us by them we can never be able to establish certain and undoubted rules of the consequence or coexistence of any secondary qualities though we could discover the size figure or motion of those invisible parts which immediately produce them we are so far from knowing what figure size or motion of parts produce a yellow colour a sweet taste or a sharp sound that we can by no means conceive how any size figure or motion of any particles can possibly produce in us the idea of any colour taste or sound whatsoever there is no conceivable connexion between the one and the other and seek in vain for certain and universal knowledge of unperceived qualities in substances in vain therefore shall we endeavour to discover by our ideas the only true way of certain and universal knowledge what other ideas are to be found constantly joined with that of our complex idea of any substance since we neither know the real constitution of the minute parts on which their qualities do depend nor did we know them could we discover any necessary connexion between them and any of the secondary qualities which is necessary to be done before we can certainly know their necessary coexistence so that let our complex idea of any species of substances be what it will we can hardly from the simple ideas contained in it certainly determine the necessary coexistence of any other quality whatsoever our knowledge in all these inquiries reaches very little further than our experience indeed some few of the primary qualities have a necessary dependence and visible connexion one with another as figure necessarily supposes extension receiving or communicating motion by impulse supposes solidity but though these and perhaps some others of our ideas have yet there are so few of them that have a visible connexion one with another that we can by intuition or demonstration discover the coexistence of very few of the qualities that are to be found united in substances and we are left only to the assistance of our senses to make known to us what qualities they contain for of all the qualities that are coexistent in any subject without this dependence and evident connexion of their ideas one with another we cannot know certainly any two to coexist any further than experience by our senses informs us thus though we see the yellow colour and upon trial find the weight malleableness fusibility and fixedness that are united in a piece of gold yet because no one of these ideas has any evident dependence or necessary connexion with the other we cannot certainly know that where any four of these are the fifth will be there also how highly probable soever it may be because the highest probability amounts not to certainty without which there can be no true knowledge for this coexistence can be no further known than it is perceived and it cannot be perceived but either in particular subjects by the observation of our senses or in general by the necessary connexion of the ideas themselves of repugnancy to coexist our knowledge is larger as to the incompatibility or repugnancy to coexistence we may know that any subject may have of each sort of primary qualities but one particular at once vg each particular extension figure number of parts motion excludes all other of each kind the like also is certain of all sensible ideas peculiar to each sense for whatever of each kind is present in any subject excludes all other of that sort vg no one subject can have two smells or two colours at the same time to this perhaps will be said has not an opal or the infusion of lignum nephriticum two colours at the same time to which i answer that these bodies to eyes differently placed may at the same time afford different colours but i take liberty also to say to eyes differently placed it is different parts of the object that reflect the particles of light and therefore it is not the same part of the object and so not the very same subject which at the same time appears both yellow and azure for it is as impossible that the very same particle of any body should at the same time differently modify or reflect the rays of light as that it should have two different figures and textures at the same time our knowledge of the coexistence of powers in bodies extends but a very little way but as to the powers of substances to change the sensible qualities of other bodies which make a great part of our inquiries about them and is no inconsiderable branch of our knowledge i doubt as to these whether our knowledge reaches much further than our experience or whether we can come to the discovery of most of these powers and be certain that they are in any subject by the connexion with any of those ideas which to us make its essence because the active and passive powers of bodies and their ways of operating consisting in a texture and motion of parts which we cannot by any means come to discover it is but in very few cases we can be able to perceive their dependence on or repugnance to any of those ideas which make our complex one of that sort of things i have here instanced in the corpuscularian hypothesis as that which is thought to go furthest in an intelligible explication of those qualities of bodies and i fear the weakness of human understanding is scarce able to substitute another which will afford us a fuller and clearer discovery of the necessary connexion and coexistence of the powers which are to be observed united in several sorts of them this at least is certain that whichever hypothesis be clearest and truest for of that it is not my business to determine our knowledge concerning corporeal substances will be very little advanced by any of them till we are made to see what qualities and powers of bodies have a necessary connexion or repugnancy one with another which in the present state of philosophy i think we know but to a very small degree and i doubt whether with those faculties we have we shall ever be able to carry our general knowledge i say not particular experience in this part much further experience is that which in this part we must depend on and it were to be wished that it were more improved we find the advantages some mens generous pains have this way brought to the stock of natural knowledge and if others especially the philosophers by fire who pretend to it had been so wary in their observations and sincere in their reports as those who call themselves philosophers ought to have been our acquaintance with the bodies here about us and our insight into their powers and operations had been yet much greater of the powers that coexist in spirits yet narrower if we are at a loss in respect of the powers and operations of bodies i think it is easy to conclude we are much more in the dark in reference to spirits whereof we naturally have no ideas but what we draw from that of our own by reflecting on the operations of our own souls within us as far as they can come within our observation but how inconsiderable a rank the spirits that inhabit our bodies hold amongst those various and possibly innumerable kinds of nobler beings and how far short they come of the endowments and perfections of cherubim and seraphim and infinite sorts of spirits above us is what by a transient hint in another place i have offered to my readers consideration of relations between abstracted ideas it is not easy to say how far our knowledge extends thirdly as to the third sort of our knowledge viz the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas in any other relation this as it is the largest field of our knowledge so it is hard to determine how far it may extend because the advances that are made in this part of knowledge depending on our sagacity in finding intermediate ideas that may show the relations and habitudes of ideas whose coexistence is not considered it is a hard matter to tell when we are at an end of such discoveries and when reason has all the helps it is capable of for the finding of proofs or examining the agreement or disagreement of remote ideas they that are ignorant of algebra cannot imagine the wonders in this kind are to be done by it and what further improvements and helps advantageous to other parts of knowledge the sagacious mind of man may yet find out it is not easy to determine this at least i believe that the ideas of quantity are not those alone that are capable of demonstration and knowledge and that other and perhaps more useful parts of contemplation would afford us certainty if vices passions and domineering interest did not oppose or menace such endeavours morality capable of demonstration the idea of a supreme being infinite in power goodness and wisdom whose workmanship we are and on whom we depend and the idea of ourselves as understanding rational creatures being such as are clear in us would i suppose if duly considered and pursued afford such foundations of our duty and rules of action as might place morality amongst the sciences capable of demonstration wherein i doubt not but from selfevident propositions by necessary consequences as incontestible as those in mathematics the measures of right and wrong might be made out to any one that will apply himself with the same indifferency and attention to the one as he does to the other of these sciences the relation of other modes may certainly be perceived as well as those of number and extension and i cannot see why they should not also be capable of demonstration if due methods were thought on to examine or pursue their agreement or disagreement where there is no property there is no injustice is a proposition as certain as any demonstration in euclid for the idea of property being a right to anything and the idea to which the name injustice is given being the invasion or violation of that right it is evident that these ideas being thus established and these names annexed to them i can as certainly know this proposition to be true as that a triangle has three angles equal to two right ones again no government allows absolute liberty the idea of government being the establishment of society upon certain rules or laws which require conformity to them and the idea of absolute liberty being for any one to do whatever he pleases i am as capable of being certain of the truth of this proposition as of any in the mathematics two things have made moral ideas to be thought incapable of demonstration their unfitness for sensible representation and their complexedness that which in this respect has given the advantage to the ideas of quantity and made them thought more capable of certainty and demonstration is first that they can be set down and represented by sensible marks which have a greater and nearer correspondence with them than any words or sounds whatsoever diagrams drawn on paper are copies of the ideas in the mind and not liable to the uncertainty that words carry in their signification an angle circle or square drawn in lines lies open to the view and cannot be mistaken it remains unchangeable and may at leisure be considered and examined and the demonstration be revised and all the parts of it may be gone over more than once without any danger of the least change in the ideas this cannot be thus done in moral ideas we have no sensible marks that resemble them whereby we can set them down we have nothing but words to express them by which though when written they remain the same yet the ideas they stand for may change in the same man and it is very seldom that they are not different in different persons secondly another thing that makes the greater difficulty in ethics is that moral ideas are commonly more complex than those of the figures ordinarily considered in mathematics from whence these two inconveniences followfirst that their names are of more uncertain signification the precise collection of simple ideas they stand for not being so easily agreed on and so the sign that is used for them in communication always and in thinking often does not steadily carry with it the same idea upon which the same disorder confusion and error follow as would if a man going to demonstrate something of an heptagon should in the diagram he took to do it leave out one of the angles or by oversight make the figure with one angle more than the name ordinarily imported or he intended it should when at first he thought of his demonstration this often happens and is hardly avoidable in very complex moral ideas where the same name being retained one angle ie one simple idea is left out or put in the complex one still called by the same name more at one time than another secondly from the complexedness of these moral ideas there follows another inconvenience viz that the mind cannot easily retain those precise combinations so exactly and perfectly as is necessary in the examination of the habitudes and correspondences agreements or disagreements of several of them one with another especially where it is to be judged of by long deductions and the intervention of several other complex ideas to show the agreement or disagreement of two remote ones the great help against this which mathematicians find in diagrams and figures which remain unalterable in their draughts is very apparent and the memory would often have great difficulty otherwise to retain them so exactly whilst the mind went over the parts of them step by step to examine their several correspondences and though in casting up a long sum either in addition multiplication or division every part be only a progression of the mind taking a view of its own ideas and considering their agreement or disagreement and the resolution of the question be nothing but the result of the whole made up of such particulars whereof the mind has a clear perception yet without setting down the several parts by marks whose precise significations are known and by marks that last and remain in view when the memory had let them go it would be almost impossible to carry so many different ideas in the mind without confounding or letting slip some parts of the reckoning and thereby making all our reasonings about it useless in which case the cyphers or marks help not the mind at all to perceive the agreement of any two or more numbers their equalities or proportions that the mind has only by intuition of its own ideas of the numbers themselves but the numerical characters are helps to the memory to record and retain the several ideas about which the demonstration is made whereby a man may know how far his intuitive knowledge in surveying several of the particulars has proceeded that so he may without confusion go on to what is yet unknown and at last have in one view before him the result of all his perceptions and reasonings remedies of our difficulties in dealing demonstratively with moral ideas one part of these disadvantages in moral ideas which has made them be thought not capable of demonstration may in a good measure be remedied by definitions setting down that collection of simple ideas which every term shall stand for and then using the terms steadily and constantly for that precise collection and what methods algebra or something of that kind may hereafter suggest to remove the other difficulties it is not easy to foretell confident i am that if men would in the same method and with the same indifferency search after moral as they do mathematical truths they would find them have a stronger connexion one with another and a more necessary consequence from our clear and distinct ideas and to come nearer perfect demonstration than is commonly imagined but much of this is not to be expected whilst the desire of esteem riches or power makes men espouse the wellendowed opinions in fashion and then seek arguments either to make good their beauty or varnish over and cover their deformity nothing being so beautiful to the eye as truth is to the mind nothing so deformed and irreconcilable to the understanding as a lie for though many a man can with satisfaction enough own a no very handsome wife to in his bosom yet who is bold enough openly to avow that he has espoused a falsehood and received into his breast so ugly a thing as a lie whilst the parties of men cram their tenets down all mens throats whom they can get into their power without permitting them to examine their truth or falsehood and will not let truth have fair play in the world nor men the liberty to search after it what improvements can be expected of this kind what greater light can be hoped for in the moral sciences the subject part of mankind in most places might instead thereof with egyptian bondage expect egyptian darkness were not the candle of the lord set up by himself in mens minds which it is impossible for the breath or power of man wholly to extinguish of the three real existences of which we have certain knowledge fourthly as to the fourth sort of our knowledge viz of the real actual existence of things we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and a demonstrative knowledge of the existence of a god of the existence of anything else we have no other but a sensitive knowledge which extends not beyond the objects present to our senses our ignorance great our knowledge being so narrow as i have shown it will perhaps give us some light into the present state of our minds if we look a little into the dark side and take a view of our ignorance which being infinitely larger than our knowledge may serve much to the quieting of disputes and improvement of useful knowledge if discovering how far we have clear and distinct ideas we confine our thoughts within the contemplation of those things that are within the reach of our understandings and launch not out into that abyss of darkness where we have not eyes to see nor faculties to perceive anything out of a presumption that nothing is beyond our comprehension but to be satisfied of the folly of such a conceit we need not go far he that knows anything knows this in the first place that he need not seek long for instances of his ignorance the meanest and most obvious things that come in our way have dark sides that the quickest sight cannot penetrate into the clearest and most enlarged understandings of thinking men find themselves puzzled and at a loss in every particle of matter we shall the less wonder to find it so when we consider the causes of our ignorance which from what has been said i suppose will be found to be these three its causes first want of ideas secondly want of a discoverable connexion between the ideas we have thirdly want of tracing and examining our ideas one cause of our ignorance want of ideas first there are some things and those not a few that we are ignorant of for want of ideas i want of simple ideas that other creatures in other parts of the universe may have first all the simple ideas we have are confined as i have shown to those we receive from corporeal objects by sensation and from the operations of our own minds as the objects of reflection but how much these few and narrow inlets are disproportionate to the vast whole extent of all beings will not be hard to persuade those who are not so foolish as to think their span the measure of all things what other simple ideas it is possible the creatures in other parts of the universe may have by the assistance of senses and faculties more or perfecter than we have or different from ours it is not for us to determine but to say or think there are no such because we conceive nothing of them is no better an argument than if a blind man should be positive in it that there was no such thing as sight and colours because he had no manner of idea of any such thing nor could by any means frame to himself any notions about seeing the ignorance and darkness that is in us no more hinders nor confines the knowledge that is in others than the blindness of a mole is an argument against the quicksightedness of an eagle he that will consider the infinite power wisdom and goodness of the creator of all things will find reason to think it was not all laid out upon so inconsiderable mean and impotent a creature as he will find man to be who in all probability is one of the lowest of all intellectual beings what faculties therefore other species of creatures have to penetrate into the nature and inmost constitutions of things what ideas they may receive of them far different from ours we know not this we know and certainly find that we want several other views of them besides those we have to make discoveries of them more perfect and we may be convinced that the ideas we can attain to by our faculties are very disproportionate to things themselves when a positive clear distinct one of substance itself which is the foundation of all the rest is concealed from us but want of ideas of this kind being a part as well as cause of our ignorance cannot be described only this i think i may confidently say of it that the intellectual and sensible world are in this perfectly alike that that part which we see of either of them holds no proportion with what we see not and whatsoever we can reach with our eyes or our thoughts of either of them is but a point almost nothing in comparison of the rest want of simple ideas that men are capable of having but have not because of their remoteness secondly another great cause of ignorance is the want of ideas we are capable of as the want of ideas which our faculties are not able to give us shuts us wholly from those views of things which it is reasonable to think other beings perfecter than we have of which we know nothing so the want of ideas i now speak of keeps us in ignorance of things we conceive capable of being known to us bulk figure and motion we have ideas of but though we are not without ideas of these primary qualities of bodies in general yet not knowing what is the particular bulk figure and motion of the greatest part of the bodies of the universe we are ignorant of the several powers efficacies and ways of operation whereby the effects which we daily see are produced these are hid from us in some things by being too remote and in others by being too minute when we consider the vast distance of the known and visible parts of the world and the reasons we have to think that what lies within our ken is but a small part of the universe we shall then discover a huge abyss of ignorance what are the particular fabrics of the great masses of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of corporeal beings how far they are extended what is their motion and how continued or communicated and what influence they have one upon another are contemplations that at first glimpse our thoughts lose themselves in if we narrow our contemplations and confine our thoughts to this little cantoni mean this system of our sun and the grosser masses of matter that visibly move about it what several sorts of vegetables animals and intellectual corporeal beings infinitely different from those of our little spot of earth may there probably be in the other planets to the knowledge of which even of their outward figures and parts we can no way attain whilst we are confined to this earth there being no natural means either by sensation or reflection to convey their certain ideas into our minds they are out of the reach of those inlets of all our knowledge and what sorts of furniture and inhabitants those mansions contain in them we cannot so much as guess much less have clear and distinct ideas of them because of their minuteness if a great nay far the greatest part of the several ranks of bodies in the universe escape our notice by their remoteness there are others that are no less concealed from us by their minuteness these insensible corpuscles being the active parts of matter and the great instruments of nature on which depend not only all their secondary qualities but also most of their natural operations our want of precise distinct ideas of their primary qualities keeps us in an incurable ignorance of what we desire to know about them i doubt not but if we could discover the figure size texture and motion of the minute constituent parts of any two bodies we should know without trial several of their operations one upon another as we do now the properties of a square or a triangle did we know the mechanical affections of the particles of rhubarb hemlock opium and a man as a watchmaker does those of a watch whereby it performs its operations and of a file which by rubbing on them will alter the figure of any of the wheels we should be able to tell beforehand that rhubarb will purge hemlock kill and opium make a man sleep as well as a watchmaker can that a little piece of paper laid on the balance will keep the watch from going till it be removed or that some small part of it being rubbed by a file the machine would quite lose its motion and the watch go no more the dissolving of silver in aqua fortis and gold in aqua regia and not vice versa would be then perhaps no more difficult to know than it is to a smith to understand why the turning of one key will open a lock and not the turning of another but whilst we are destitute of senses acute enough to discover the minute particles of bodies and to give us ideas of their mechanical affections we must be content to be ignorant of their properties and ways of operation nor can we be assured about them any further than some few trials we make are able to reach but whether they will succeed again another time we cannot be certain this hinders our certain knowledge of universal truths concerning natural bodies and our reason carries us herein very little beyond particular matter of fact hence no science of bodies within our reach and therefore i am apt to doubt that how far soever human industry may advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical things scientifical will still be out of our reach because we want perfect and adequate ideas of those very bodies which are nearest to us and most under our command those which we have ranked into classes under names and we think ourselves best acquainted with we have but very imperfect and incomplete ideas of distinct ideas of the several sorts of bodies that fall under the examination of our senses perhaps we may have but adequate ideas i suspect we have not of any one amongst them and though the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse yet whilst we want the latter we are not capable of scientifical knowledge nor shall ever be able to discover general instructive unquestionable truths concerning them certainty and demonstration are things we must not in these matters pretend to by the colour figure taste and smell and other sensible qualities we have as clear and distinct ideas of sage and hemlock as we have of a circle and a triangle but having no ideas of the particular primary qualities of the minute parts of either of these plants nor of other bodies which we would apply them to we cannot tell what effects they will produce nor when we see those effects can we so much as guess much less know their manner of production thus having no ideas of the particular mechanical affections of the minute parts of bodies that are within our view and reach we are ignorant of their constitutions powers and operations and of bodies more remote we are yet more ignorant not knowing so much as their very outward shapes or the sensible and grosser parts of their constitutions much less a science of unembodied spirits this at first will show us how disproportionate our knowledge is to the whole extent even of material beings to which if we add the consideration of that infinite number of spirits that may be and probably are which are yet more remote from our knowledge whereof we have no cognizance nor can frame to ourselves any distinct ideas of their several ranks and sorts we shall find this cause of ignorance conceal from us in an impenetrable obscurity almost the whole intellectual world a greater certainty and more beautiful world than the material for bating some very few and those if i may so call them superficial ideas of spirit which by reflection we get of our own and from thence the best we can collect of the father of all spirits the eternal independent author of them and us and all things we have no certain information so much as of the existence of other spirits but by revelation angels of all sorts are naturally beyond our discovery and all those intelligences whereof it is likely there are more orders than of corporeal substances are things whereof our natural faculties give us no certain account at all that there are minds and thinking beings in other men as well as himself every man has a reason from their words and actions to be satisfied and the knowledge of his own mind cannot suffer a man that considers to be ignorant that there is a god but that there are degrees of spiritual beings between us and the great god who is there that by his own search and ability can come to know much less have we distinct ideas of their different natures conditions states powers and several constitutions wherein they agree or differ from one another and from us and therefore in what concerns their different species and properties we are in absolute ignorance another cause want of a discoverable connexion between ideas we have secondly what a small part of the substantial beings that are in the universe the want of ideas leaves open to our knowledge we have seen in the next place another cause of ignorance of no less moment is a want of a discoverable connexion between those ideas we have for wherever we want that we are utterly incapable of universal and certain knowledge and are in the former case left only to observation and experiment which how narrow and confined it is how far from general knowledge we need not be told i shall give some few instances of this cause of our ignorance and so leave it it is evident that the bulk figure and motion of several bodies about us produce in us several sensations as of colours sounds tastes smells pleasure and pain c these mechanical affections of bodies having no affinity at all with those ideas they produce in us there being no conceivable connexion between any impulse of any sort of body and any perception of a colour or smell which we find in our minds we can have no distinct knowledge of such operations beyond our experience and can reason no otherwise about them than as effects produced by the appointment of an infinitely wise agent which perfectly surpass our comprehensions as the ideas of sensible secondary qualities which we have in our minds can by us be no way deduced from bodily causes nor any correspondence or connexion be found between them and those primary qualities which experience shows us produce them in us so on the other side the operation of our minds upon our bodies is as inconceivable how any thought should produce a motion in body is as remote from the nature of our ideas as how any body should produce any thought in the mind that it is so if experience did not convince us the consideration of the things themselves would never be able in the least to discover to us these and the like though they have a constant and regular connexion in the ordinary course of things yet that connexion being not discoverable in the ideas themselves which appearing to have no necessary dependence one on another we can attribute their connexion to nothing else but the arbitrary determination of that allwise agent who has made them to be and to operate as they do in a way wholly above our weak understandings to conceive instances in some of our ideas there are certain relations habitudes and connexions so visibly included in the nature of the ideas themselves that we cannot conceive them separable from them by any power whatsoever and in these only we are capable of certain and universal knowledge thus the idea of a rightlined triangle necessarily carries with it an equality of its angles to two right ones nor can we conceive this relation this connexion of these two ideas to be possibly mutable or to depend on any arbitrary power which of choice made it thus or could make it otherwise but the coherence and continuity of the parts of matter the production of sensation in us of colours and sounds c by impulse and motion nay the original rules and communication of motion being such wherein we can discover no natural connexion with any ideas we have we cannot but ascribe them to the arbitrary will and good pleasure of the wise architect i need not i think here mention the resurrection of the dead the future state of this globe of earth and such other things which are by every one acknowledged to depend wholly on the determination of a free agent the things that as far as our observation reaches we constantly find to proceed regularly we may conclude do act by a law set them but yet by a law that we know not whereby though causes work steadily and effects constantly flow from them yet their connexions and dependencies being not discoverable in our ideas we can have but an experimental knowledge of them from all which it is easy to perceive what a darkness we are involved in how little it is of being and the things that are that we are capable to know and therefore we shall do no injury to our knowledge when we modestly think with ourselves that we are so far from being able to comprehend the whole nature of the universe and all the things contained in it that we are not capable of a philosophical knowledge of the bodies that are about us and make a part of us concerning their secondary qualities powers and operations we can have no universal certainty several effects come every day within the notice of our senses of which we have so far sensitive knowledge but the causes manner and certainty of their production for the two foregoing reasons we must be content to be very ignorant of in these we can go no further than particular experience informs us matter of fact and by analogy to guess what effects the like bodies are upon other trials like to produce but as to a perfect science of natural bodies not to mention spiritual beings we are i think so far from being capable of any such thing that i conclude it lost labour to seek after it a third cause want of tracing our ideas thirdly where we have adequate ideas and where there is a certain and discoverable connexion between them yet we are often ignorant for want of tracing those ideas which we have or may have and for want of finding out those intermediate ideas which may show us what habitude of agreement or disagreement they have one with another and thus many are ignorant of mathematical truths not out of any imperfection of their faculties or uncertainty in the things themselves but for want of application in acquiring examining and by due ways comparing those ideas that which has most contributed to hinder the due tracing of our ideas and finding out their relations and agreements or disagreements one with another has been i suppose the ill use of words it is impossible that men should ever truly seek or certainly discover the agreement or disagreement of ideas themselves whilst their thoughts flutter about or stick only in sounds of doubtful and uncertain significations mathematicians abstracting their thoughts from names and accustoming themselves to set before their minds the ideas themselves that they would consider and not sounds instead of them have avoided thereby a great part of that perplexity puddering and confusion which has so much hindered mens progress in other parts of knowledge for whilst they stick in words of undetermined and uncertain signification they are unable to distinguish true from false certain from probable consistent from inconsistent in their own opinions this having been the fate or misfortune of a great part of men of letters the increase brought into the stock of real knowledge has been very little in proportion to the schools disputes and writings the world has been filled with whilst students being lost in the great wood of words knew not whereabouts they were how far their discoveries were advanced or what was wanting in their own or the general stock of knowledge had men in the discoveries of the material done as they have in those of the intellectual world involved all in the obscurity of uncertain and doubtful ways of talking volumes writ of navigation and voyages theories and stories of zones and tides multiplied and disputed nay ships built and fleets sent out would never have taught us the way beyond the line and the antipodes would be still as much unknown as when it was declared heresy to hold there were any but having spoken sufficiently of words and the ill or careless use that is commonly made of them i shall not say anything more of it here extent of human knowledge in respect to its universality hitherto we have examined the extent of our knowledge in respect of the several sorts of beings that are there is another extent of it in respect of universality which will also deserve to be considered and in this regard our knowledge follows the nature of our ideas if the ideas are abstract whose agreement or disagreement we perceive our knowledge is universal for what is known of such general ideas will be true of every particular thing in whom that essence ie that abstract idea is to be found and what is once known of such ideas will be perpetually and for ever true so that as to all general knowledge we must search and find it only in our minds and it is only the examining of our own ideas that furnisheth us with that truths belonging to essences of things that is to abstract ideas are eternal and are to be found out by the contemplation only of those essences as the existence of things is to be known only from experience but having more to say of this in the chapters where i shall speak of general and real knowledge this may here suffice as to the universality of our knowledge in general of the reality of knowledge objection knowledge placed in our ideas may be all unreal or chimerical i doubt not but my reader by this time may be apt to think that i have been all this while only building a castle in the air and be ready to say to me to what purpose all this stir knowledge say you is only the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas but who knows what those ideas may be is there anything so extravagant as the imaginations of mens brains where is the head that has no chimeras in it or if there be a sober and a wise man what difference will there be by your rules between his knowledge and that of the most extravagant fancy in the world they both have their ideas and perceive their agreement and disagreement one with another if there be any difference between them the advantage will be on the warmheaded mans side as having the more ideas and the more lively and so by your rules he will be the more knowing if it be true that all knowledge lies only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas the visions of an enthusiast and the reasonings of a sober man will be equally certain it is no matter how things are so a man observe but the agreement of his own imaginations and talk conformably it is all truth all certainty such castles in the air will be as strongholds of truth as the demonstrations of euclid that an harpy is not a centaur is by this way as certain knowledge and as much a truth as that a square is not a circle but of what use is all this fine knowledge of mens own imaginations to a man that inquires after the reality of things it matters not what mens fancies are it is the knowledge of things that is only to be prized it is this alone gives a value to our reasonings and preference to one mans knowledge over anothers that it is of things as they really are and not of dreams and fancies answer not so where ideas agree with things to which i answer that if our knowledge of our ideas terminate in them and reach no further where there is something further intended our most serious thoughts will be of little more use than the reveries of a crazy brain and the truths built thereon of no more weight than the discourses of a man who sees things clearly in a dream and with great assurance utters them but i hope before i have done to make it evident that this way of certainty by the knowledge of our own ideas goes a little further than bare imagination and i believe it will appear that all the certainty of general truths a man has lies in nothing else but what shall be the criterion of this agreement it is evident the mind knows not things immediately but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them our knowledge therefore is real only so far as there is a conformity between our ideas and the reality of things but what shall be here the criterion how shall the mind when it perceives nothing but its own ideas know that they agree with things themselves this though it seems not to want difficulty yet i think there be two sorts of ideas that we may be assured agree with things as all simple ideas are really conformed to things first the first are simple ideas which since the mind as has been shown can by no means make to itself must necessarily be the product of things operating on the mind in a natural way and producing therein those perceptions which by the wisdom and will of our maker they are ordained and adapted to from whence it follows that simple ideas are not fictions of our fancies but the natural and regular productions of things without us really operating upon us and so carry with them all the conformity which is intended or which our state requires for they represent to us things under those appearances which they are fitted to produce in us whereby we are enabled to distinguish the sorts of particular substances to discern the states they are in and so to take them for our necessities and apply them to our uses thus the idea of whiteness or bitterness as it is in the mind exactly answering that power which is in any body to produce it there has all the real conformity it can or ought to have with things without us and this conformity between our simple ideas and the existence of things is sufficient for real knowledge all complex ideas except ideas of substances are their own archetypes secondly all our complex ideas except those of substances being archetypes of the minds own making not intended to be the copies of anything nor referred to the existence of anything as to their originals cannot want any conformity necessary to real knowledge for that which is not designed to represent anything but itself can never be capable of a wrong representation nor mislead us from the true apprehension of anything by its dislikeness to it and such excepting those of substances are all our complex ideas which as i have shown in another place are combinations of ideas which the mind by its free choice puts together without considering any connexion they have in nature and hence it is that in all these sorts the ideas themselves are considered as the archetypes and things no otherwise regarded but as they are conformable to them so that we cannot but be infallibly certain that all the knowledge we attain concerning these ideas is real and reaches things themselves because in all our thoughts reasonings and discourses of this kind we intend things no further than as they are conformable to our ideas so that in these we cannot miss of a certain and undoubted reality hence the reality of mathematical knowledge i doubt not but it will be easily granted that the knowledge we have of mathematical truths is not only certain but real knowledge and not the bare empty vision of vain insignificant chimeras of the brain and yet if we will consider we shall find that it is only of our own ideas the mathematician considers the truth and properties belonging to a rectangle or circle only as they are in idea in his own mind for it is possible he never found either of them existing mathematically ie precisely true in his life but yet the knowledge he has of any truths or properties belonging to a circle or any other mathematical figure are nevertheless true and certain even of real things existing because real things are no further concerned nor intended to be meant by any such propositions than as things really agree to those archetypes in his mind is it true of the idea of a triangle that its three angles are equal to two right ones it is true also of a triangle wherever it really exists whatever other figure exists that it is not exactly answerable to that idea of a triangle in his mind is not at all concerned in that proposition and therefore he is certain all his knowledge concerning such ideas is real knowledge because intending things no further than they agree with those his ideas he is sure what he knows concerning those figures when they have barely an ideal existence in his mind will hold true of them also when they have a real existence in matter his consideration being barely of those figures which are the same wherever or however they exist and of moral and hence it follows that moral knowledge is as capable of real certainty as mathematics for certainty being but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas and demonstration nothing but the perception of such agreement by the intervention of other ideas or mediums our moral ideas as well as mathematical being archetypes themselves and so adequate and complete ideas all the agreement or disagreement which we shall find in them will produce real knowledge as well as in mathematical figures existence not required to make abstract knowledge real for the attaining of knowledge and certainty it is requisite that we have determined ideas and to make our knowledge real it is requisite that the ideas answer their archetypes nor let it be wondered that i place the certainty of our knowledge in the consideration of our ideas with so little care and regard as it may seem to the real existence of things since most of those discourses which take up the thoughts and engage the disputes of those who pretend to make it their business to inquire after truth and certainty will i presume upon examination be found to be general propositions and notions in which existence is not at all concerned all the discourses of the mathematicians about the squaring of a circle conic sections or any other part of mathematics concern not the existence of any of those figures but their demonstrations which depend on their ideas are the same whether there be any square or circle existing in the world or no in the same manner the truth and certainty of moral discourses abstracts from the lives of men and the existence of those virtues in the world whereof they treat nor are tullys offices less true because there is nobody in the world that exactly practises his rules and lives up to that pattern of a virtuous man which he has given us and which existed nowhere when he writ but in idea if it be true in speculation ie in idea that murder deserves death it will also be true in reality of any action that exists conformable to that idea of murder as for other actions the truth of that proposition concerns them not and thus it is of all other species of things which have no other essences but those ideas which are in the minds of men nor will it be less true or certain because moral ideas are of our own making and naming but it will here be said that if moral knowledge be placed in the contemplation of our own moral ideas and those as other modes be of our own making what strange notions will there be of justice and temperance what confusion of virtues and vice if every one may make what ideas of them he pleases no confusion or disorder in the things themselves nor the reasonings about them no more than in mathematics there would be a disturbance in the demonstration or a change in the properties of figures and their relations one to another if a man should make a triangle with four corners or a trapezium with four right angles that is in plain english change the names of the figures and call that by one name which mathematicians call ordinarily by another for let a man make to himself the idea of a figure with three angles whereof one is a right one and call it if he please equilaterum or trapezium or anything else the properties of and demonstrations about that idea will be the same as if he called it a rectangular triangle i confess the change of the name by the impropriety of speech will at first disturb him who knows not what idea it stands for but as soon as the figure is drawn the consequences and demonstrations are plain and clear just the same is it in moral knowledge let a man have the idea of taking from others without their consent what their honest industry has possessed them of and call this justice if he please he that takes the name here without the idea put to it will be mistaken by joining another idea of his own to that name but strip the idea of that name or take it such as it is in the speakers mind and the same things will agree to it as if you called it injustice indeed wrong names in moral discourses breed usually more disorder because they are not so easily rectified as in mathematics where the figure once drawn and seen makes the name useless and of no force for what need of a sign when the thing signified is present and in view but in moral names that cannot be so easily and shortly done because of the many decompositions that go to the making up the complex ideas of those modes but yet for all this the miscalling of any of those ideas contrary to the usual signification of the words of that language hinders not but that we may have certain and demonstrative knowledge of their several agreements and disagreements if we will carefully as in mathematics keep to the same precise ideas and trace them in their several relations one to another without being led away by their names if we but separate the idea under consideration from the sign that stands for it our knowledge goes equally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty whatever sounds we make use of misnaming disturbs not the certainty of the knowledge one thing more we are to take notice of that where god or any other lawmaker hath defined any moral names there they have made the essence of that species to which that name belongs and there it is not safe to apply or use them otherwise but in other cases it is bare impropriety of speech to apply them contrary to the common usage of the country but yet even this too disturbs not the certainty of that knowledge which is still to be had by a due contemplation and comparing of those even nicknamed ideas our complex ideas of substances have their archetypes without us and here knowledge comes short thirdly there is another sort of complex ideas which being referred to archetypes without us may differ from them and so our knowledge about them may come short of being real such are our ideas of substances which consisting of a collection of simple ideas supposed taken from the works of nature may yet vary from them by having more or different ideas united in them than are to be found united in the things themselves from whence it comes to pass that they may and often do fail of being exactly conformable to things themselves so far as our complex ideas agree with those archetypes without us so far our knowledge concerning substances is real i say then that to have ideas of substances which by being conformable to things may afford us real knowledge it is not enough as in modes to put together such ideas as have no inconsistence though they did never before so exist vg the ideas of sacrilege or perjury c were as real and true ideas before as after the existence of any such fact but our ideas of substances being supposed copies and referred to archetypes without us must still be taken from something that does or has existed they must not consist of ideas put together at the pleasure of our thoughts without any real pattern they were taken from though we can perceive no inconsistence in such a combination the reason whereof is because we knowing not what real constitution it is of substances whereon our simple ideas depend and which really is the cause of the strict union of some of them one with another and the exclusion of others there are very few of them that we can be sure are or are not inconsistent in nature any further than experience and sensible observation reach herein therefore is founded the reality of our knowledge concerning substancesthat all our complex ideas of them must be such and such only as are made up of such simple ones as have been discovered to coexist in nature and our ideas being thus true though not perhaps very exact copies are yet the subjects of real as far as we have any knowledge of them which as has been already shown will not be found to reach very far but so far as it does it will still be real knowledge whatever ideas we have the agreement we find they have with others will still be knowledge if those ideas be abstract it will be general knowledge but to make it real concerning substances the ideas must be taken from the real existence of things whatever simple ideas have been found to coexist in any substance these we may with confidence join together again and so make abstract ideas of substances for whatever have once had an union in nature may be united again in our inquiries about substances we must consider ideas and not confine our thoughts to names or species supposed set out by names this if we rightly consider and confine not our thoughts and abstract ideas to names as if there were or could be no other sorts of things than what known names had already determined and as it were set out we should think of things with greater freedom and less confusion than perhaps we do it would possibly be thought a bold paradox if not a very dangerous falsehood if i should say that some changelings who have lived forty years together without any appearance of reason are something between a man and a beast which prejudice is founded upon nothing else but a false supposition that these two names man and beast stand for distinct species so set out by real essences that there can come no other species between them whereas if we will abstract from those names and the supposition of such specific essences made by nature wherein all things of the same denominations did exactly and equally partake if we would not fancy that there were a certain number of these essences wherein all things as in moulds were cast and formed we should find that the idea of the shape motion and life of a man without reason is as much a distinct idea and makes as much a distinct sort of things from man and beast as the idea of the shape of an ass with reason would be different from either that of man or beast and be a species of an animal between or distinct from both objection against a changeling being something between a man and beast answered here everybody will be ready to ask if changelings may be supposed something between man and beast pray what are they i answer changelings which is as good a word to signify something different from the signification of man or beast as the names man and beast are to have significations different one from the other this well considered would resolve this matter and show my meaning without any more ado but i am not so unacquainted with the zeal of some men which enables them to spin consequences and to see religion threatened whenever any one ventures to quit their forms of speaking as not to foresee what names such a proposition as this is like to be charged with and without doubt it will be asked if changelings are something between man and beast what will become of them in the other world to which i answer i it concerns me not to know or inquire to their own master they stand or fall it will make their state neither better nor worse whether we determine anything of it or no they are in the hands of a faithful creator and a bountiful father who disposes not of his creatures according to our narrow thoughts or opinions nor distinguishes them according to names and species of our contrivance and we that know so little of this present world we are in may i think content ourselves without being peremptory in defining the different states which creatures shall come into when they go off this stage it may suffice us that he hath made known to all those who are capable of instruction discoursing and reasoning that they shall come to an account and receive according to what they have done in this body what will become of changelings in a future state but secondly i answer the force of these mens question viz will you deprive changelings of a future state is founded on one of these two suppositions which are both false the first is that all things that have the outward shape and appearance of a man must necessarily be designed to an immortal future being after this life or secondly that whatever is of human birth must be so take away these imaginations and such questions will be groundless and ridiculous i desire then those who think there is no more but an accidental difference between themselves and changelings the essence in both being exactly the same to consider whether they can imagine immortality annexed to any outward shape of the body the very proposing it is i suppose enough to make them disown it no one yet that ever i heard of how much soever immersed in matter allowed that excellency to any figure of the gross sensible outward parts as to affirm eternal life due to it or a necessary consequence of it or that any mass of matter should after its dissolution here be again restored hereafter to an everlasting state of sense perception and knowledge only because it was moulded into this or that figure and had such a particular frame of its visible parts such an opinion as this placing immortality in a certain superficial figure turns out of doors all consideration of soul or spirit upon whose account alone some corporeal beings have hitherto been concluded immortal and others not this is to attribute more to the outside than inside of things and to place the excellency of a man more in the external shape of his body than internal perfections of his soul which is but little better than to annex the great and inestimable advantage of immortality and life everlasting which he has above other material beings to annex it i say to the cut of his beard or the fashion of his coat for this or that outward mark of our bodies no more carries with it the hope of an eternal duration than the fashion of a mans suit gives him reasonable grounds to imagine it will never wear out or that it will make him immortal it will perhaps be said that nobody thinks that the shape makes anything immortal but it is the shape is the sign of a rational soul within which is immortal i wonder who made it the sign of any such thing for barely saying it will not make it so it would require some proofs to persuade one of it no figure that i know speaks any such language for it may as rationally be concluded that the dead body of a man wherein there is to be found no more appearance or action of life than there is in a statue has yet nevertheless a living soul in it because of its shape as that there is a rational soul in a changeling because he has the outside of a rational creature when his actions carry far less marks of reason with them in the whole course of his life than what are to be found in many a beast monsters but it is the issue of rational parents and must therefore be concluded to have a rational soul i know not by what logic you must so conclude i am sure this is a conclusion that men nowhere allow of for if they did they would not make bold as everywhere they do to destroy illformed and misshaped productions ay but these are monsters let them be so what will your drivelling unintelligent intractable changeling be shall a defect in the body make a monster a defect in the mind the far more noble and in the common phrase the far more essential part not shall the want of a nose or a neck make a monster and put such issue out of the rank of men the want of reason and understanding not this is to bring all back again to what was exploded just now this is to place all in the shape and to take the measure of a man only by his outside to show that according to the ordinary way of reasoning in this matter people do lay the whole stress on the figure and resolve the whole essence of the species of man as they make it into the outward shape how unreasonable soever it be and how much soever they disown it we need but trace their thoughts and practice a little further and then it will plainly appear the wellshaped changeling is a man has a rational soul though it appear not this is past doubt say you make the ears a little longer and more pointed and the nose a little flatter than ordinary and then you begin to boggle make the face yet narrower flatter and longer and then you are at a stand add still more and more of the likeness of a brute to it and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal then presently it is a monster and it is demonstration with you that it hath no rational soul and must be destroyed where now i ask shall be the just measure which the utmost bounds of that shape that carries with it a rational soul for since there have been human foetuses produced half beast and half man and others three parts one and one part the other and so it is possible they may be in all the variety of approaches to the one or the other shape and may have several degrees of mixture of the likeness of a man or a brutei would gladly know what are those precise lineaments which according to this hypothesis are or are not capable of a rational soul to be joined to them what sort of outside is the certain sign that there is or is not such an inhabitant within for till that be done we talk at random of man and shall always i fear do so as long as we give ourselves up to certain sounds and the imaginations of settled and fixed species in nature we know not what but after all i desire it may be considered that those who think they have answered the difficulty by telling us that a misshaped foetus is a monster run into the same fault they are arguing against by constituting a species between man and beast for what else i pray is their monster in the case if the word monster signifies anything at all but something neither man nor beast but partaking somewhat of either and just so is the changeling before mentioned so necessary is it to quit the common notion of species and essences if we will truly look into the nature of things and examine them by what our faculties can discover in them as they exist and not by groundless fancies that have been taken up about them words and species i have mentioned this here because i think we cannot be too cautious that words and species in the ordinary notions which we have been used to of them impose not on us for i am apt to think therein lies one great obstacle to our clear and distinct knowledge especially in reference to substances and from thence has risen a great part of the difficulties about truth and certainty would we accustom ourselves to separate our contemplations and reasonings from words we might in a great measure remedy this inconvenience within our own thoughts but yet it would still disturb us in our discourse with others as long as we retained the opinion that species and their essences were anything else but our abstract ideas such as they are with names annexed to them to be the signs of them recapitulation wherever we perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas there is certain knowledge and wherever we are sure those ideas agree with the reality of things there is certain real knowledge of which agreement of our ideas with the reality of things having here given the marks i think i have shown wherein it is that certainty real certainty consists which whatever it was to others was i confess to me heretofore one of those desiderata which i found great want of of truth in general what truth is what is truth was an inquiry many ages since and it being that which all mankind either do or pretend to search after it cannot but be worth our while carefully to examine wherein it consists and so acquaint ourselves with the nature of it as to observe how the mind distinguishes it from falsehood a right joining or separating of signs ie either ideas or words truth then seems to me in the proper import of the word to signify nothing but the joining or separating of signs as the things signified by them do agree or disagree one with another the joining or separating of signs here meant is what by another name we call proposition so that truth properly belongs only to propositions whereof there are two sorts viz mental and verbal as there are two sorts of signs commonly made use of viz ideas and words which make mental or verbal propositions to form a clear notion of truth it is very necessary to consider truth of thought and truth of words distinctly one from another but yet it is very difficult to treat of them asunder because it is unavoidable in treating of mental propositions to make use of words and then the instances given of mental propositions cease immediately to be barely mental and become verbal for a mental proposition being nothing but a bare consideration of the ideas as they are in our minds stripped of names they lose the nature of purely mental propositions as soon as they are put into words mental propositions are very hard to he treated of and that which makes it yet harder to treat of mental and verbal propositions separately is that most men if not all in their thinking and reasonings within themselves make use of words instead of ideas at least when the subject of their meditation contains in it complex ideas which is a great evidence of the imperfection and uncertainty of our ideas of that kind and may if attentively made use of serve for a mark to show us what are those things we have clear and perfect established ideas of and what not for if we will curiously observe the way our mind takes in thinking and reasoning we shall find i suppose that when we make any propositions within our own thoughts about white or black sweet or bitter a triangle or a circle we can and often do frame in our minds the ideas themselves without reflecting on the names but when we would consider or make propositions about the more complex ideas as of a man vitriol fortitude glory we usually put the name for the idea because the ideas these names stand for being for the most part imperfect confused and undetermined we reflect on the names themselves because they are more clear certain and distinct and readier occur to our thoughts than the pure ideas and so we make use of these words instead of the ideas themselves even when we would meditate and reason within ourselves and make tacit mental propositions in substances as has been already noticed this is occasioned by the imperfections of our ideas we making the name stand for the real essence of which we have no idea at all in modes it is occasioned by the great number of simple ideas that go to the making them up for many of them being compounded the name occurs much easier than the complex idea itself which requires time and attention to be recollected and exactly represented to the mind even in those men who have formerly been at the pains to do it and is utterly impossible to be done by those who though they have ready in their memory the greatest part of the common words of that language yet perhaps never troubled themselves in all their lives to consider what precise ideas the most of them stood for some confused or obscure notions have served their turns and many who talk very much of religion and conscience of church and faith of power and right of obstructions and humours melancholy and choler would perhaps have little left in their thoughts and meditations if one should desire them to think only of the things themselves and lay by those words with which they so often confound others and not seldom themselves also mental and verbal propositions contrasted but to return to the consideration of truth we must i say observe two sorts of propositions that we are capable of making first mental wherein the ideas in our understandings are without the use of words put together or separated by the mind perceiving or judging of their agreement or disagreement secondly verbal propositions which are words the signs of our ideas put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences by which way of affirming or denying these signs made by sounds are as it were put together or separated one from another so that proposition consists in joining or separating signs and truth consists in the putting together or separating those signs according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree when mental propositions contain real truth and when verbal every ones experience will satisfy him that the mind either by perceiving or supposing the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas does tacitly within itself put them into a kind of proposition affirmative or negative which i have endeavoured to express by the terms putting together and separating but this action of the mind which is so familiar to ev ery thinking and reasoning man is easier to be conceived by reflecting on what passes in us when we affirm or deny than to be explained by words when a man has in his head the idea of two lines viz the side and diagonal of a square whereof the diagonal is an inch long he may have the idea also of the division of that line into a certain number of equal parts vg into five ten a hundred a thousand or any other number and may have the idea of that inch line being divisible or not divisible into such equal parts as a certain number of them will be equal to the sideline now whenever he perceives believes or supposes such a kind of divisibility to agree or disagree to his idea of that line he as it were joins or separates those two ideas viz the idea of that line and the idea of that kind of divisibility and so makes a mental proposition which is true or false according as such a kind of divisibility a divisibility into such aliquot parts does really agree to that line or no when ideas are so put together or separated in the mind as they or the things they stand for do agree or not that is as i may call it mental truth but truth of words is something more and that is the affirming or denying of words one of another as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree and this again is twofold either purely verbal and trifling which i shall speak of chap viii or real and instructive which is the object of that real knowledge which we have spoken of already objection against verbal truth that thus it may all be chimerical but here again will be apt to occur the same doubt about truth that did about knowledge and it will be objected that if truth be nothing but the joining and separating of words in propositions as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree in mens minds the knowledge of truth is not so valuable a thing as it is taken to be nor worth the pains and time men employ in the search of it since by this account it amounts to no more than the conformity of words to the chimeras of mens brains who knows not what odd notions many mens heads are filled with and what strange ideas all mens brains are capable of but if we rest here we know the truth of nothing by this rule but of the visionary words in our own imaginations nor have other truth but what as much concerns harpies and centaurs as men and horses for those and the like may be ideas in our heads and have their agreement or disagreement there as well as the ideas of real beings and so have as true propositions made about them and it will be altogether as true a proposition to say all centaurs are animals as that all men are animals and the certainty of one as great as the other for in both the propositions the words are put together according to the agreement of the ideas in our minds and the agreement of the idea of animal with that of centaur is as clear and visible to the mind as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of man and so these two propositions are equally true equally certain but of what use is all such truth to us answered real truth is about ideas agreeing to things though what has been said in the foregoing chapter to distinguish real from imaginary knowledge might suffice here in answer to this doubt to distinguish real truth from chimerical or if you please barely nominal they depending both on the same foundation yet it may not be amiss here again to consider that though our words signify nothing but our ideas yet being designed by them to signify things the truth they contain when put into propositions will be only verbal when they stand for ideas in the mind that have not an agreement with the reality of things and therefore truth as well as knowledge may well come under the distinction of verbal and real that being only verbal truth wherein terms are joined according to the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for without regarding whether our ideas are such as really have or are capable of having an existence in nature but then it is they contain real truth when these signs are joined as our ideas agree and when our ideas are such as we know are capable of having an existence in nature which in substances we cannot know but by knowing that such have existed truth and falsehood in general truth is the marking down in words the agreement or disagreement of ideas as it is falsehood is the marking down in words the agreement or disagreement of ideas otherwise than it is and so far as these ideas thus marked by sounds agree to their archetypes so far only is the truth real the knowledge of this truth consists in knowing what ideas the words stand for and the perception of the agreement or disagreement of those ideas according as it is marked by those words general propositions to be treated of more at large but because words are looked on as the great conduits of truth and knowledge and that in conveying and receiving of truth and commonly in reasoning about it we make use of words and propositions i shall more at large inquire wherein the certainty of real truths contained in propositions consists and where it is to be had and endeavour to show in what sort of universal propositions we are capable of being certain of their real truth or falsehood i shall begin with general propositions as those which most employ our thoughts and exercise our contemplation general truths are most looked after by the mind as those that most enlarge our knowledge and by their comprehensiveness satisfying us at once of many particulars enlarge our view and shorten our way to knowledge moral and metaphysical truth besides truth taken in the strict sense before mentioned there are other sorts of truths as moral truth which is speaking of things according to the persuasion of our own minds though the proposition we speak agree not to the reality of things metaphysical truth which is nothing but the real existence of things conformable to the ideas to which we have annexed their names this though it seems to consist in the very beings of things yet when considered a little nearly will appear to include a tacit proposition whereby the mind joins that particular thing to the idea it had before settled with the name to it but these considerations of truth either having been before taken notice of or not being much to our present purpose it may suffice here only to have mentioned them i of universal propositions their truth and certainty treating of words necessary to knowledge though the examining and judging of ideas by themselves their names being quite laid aside be the best and surest way to clear and distinct knowledge yet through the prevailing custom of using sounds for ideas i think it is very seldom practised every one may observe how common it is for names to be made use of instead of the ideas themselves even when men think and reason within their own breasts especially if the ideas be very complex and made up of a great collection of simple ones this makes the consideration of words and propositions so necessary a part of the treatise of knowledge that it is very hard to speak intelligibly of the one without explaining the other general truths hardly to be understood but in verbal propositions all the knowledge we have being only of particular or general truths it is evident that whatever may be done in the former of these the latter which is that which with reason is most sought after can never be well made known and is very seldom apprehended but as conceived and expressed in words it is not therefore out of our way in the examination of our knowledge to inquire into the truth and certainty of universal propositions certainty twofoldof truth and of knowledge but that we may not be misled in this case by that which is the danger everywhere i mean by the doubtfulness of terms it is fit to observe that certainty is twofold certainty of truth and certainty of knowledge certainty of truth is when words are so put together in propositions as exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for as really it is certainty of knowledge is to perceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas as expressed in any proposition this we usually call knowing or being certain of the truth of any proposition no proposition can be certainly known to be true where the real essence of each species mentioned is not known now because we cannot be certain of the truth of any general proposition unless we know the precise bounds and extent of the species its terms stand for it is necessary we should know the essence of each species which is that which constitutes and bounds it this in all simple ideas and modes is not hard to do for in these the real and nominal essence being the same or which is all one the abstract idea which the general term stands for being the sole essence and boundary that is or can be supposed of the species there can be no doubt how far the species extends or what things are comprehended under each term which it is evident are all that have an exact conformity with the idea it stands for and no other but in substances wherein a real essence distinct from the nominal is supposed to constitute determine and bound the species the extent of the general word is very uncertain because not knowing this real essence we cannot know what is or what is not of that species and consequently what may or may not with certainty be affirmed of it and thus speaking of a man or gold or any other species of natural substances as supposed constituted by a precise and real essence which nature regularly imparts to every individual of that kind whereby it is made to be of that species we cannot be certain of the truth of any affirmation or negation made of it for man or gold taken in this sense and used for species of things constituted by real essences different from the complex idea in the mind of the speaker stand for we know not what and the extent of these species with such boundaries are so unknown and undetermined that it is impossible with any certainty to affirm that all men are rational or that all gold is yellow but where the nominal essence is kept to as the boundary of each species and men extend the application of any general term no further than to the particular things in which the complex idea it stands for is to be found there they are in no danger to mistake the bounds of each species nor can be in doubt on this account whether any proposition be true or not i have chosen to explain this uncertainty of propositions in this scholastic way and have made use of the terms of essences and species on purpose to show the absurdity and inconvenience there is to think of them as of any other sort of realities than barely abstract ideas with names to them to suppose that the species of things are anything but the sorting of them under general names according as they agree to several abstract ideas of which we make those names the signs is to confound truth and introduce uncertainty into all general propositions that can be made about them though therefore these things might to people not possessed with scholastic learning be treated of in a better and clearer way yet those wrong notions of essences or species having got root in most peoples minds who have received any tincture from the learning which has prevailed in this part of the world are to be discovered and removed to make way for that use of words which should convey certainty with it this more particularly concerns substances the names of substances then whenever made to stand for species which are supposed to be constituted by real essences which we know not are not capable to convey certainty to the understanding of the truth of general propositions made up of such terms we cannot be sure the reason whereof is plain for how can we be sure that this or that quality is in gold when we know not what is or is not gold since in this way of speaking nothing is gold but what partakes of an essence which we not knowing cannot know where it is or is not and so cannot be sure that any parcel of matter in the world is or is not in this sense gold being incurably ignorant whether it has or has not that which makes anything to be called gold ie that real essence of gold whereof we have no idea at all this being as impossible for us to know as it is for a blind man to tell in what flower the colour of a pansy is or is not to be found whilst he has no idea of the colour of a pansy at an or if we could which is impossible certainly know where a real essence which we know not is vg in what parcels of matter the real essence of gold is yet could we not be sure that this or that quality could with truth be affirmed of gold since it is impossible for us to know that this or that quality or idea has a necessary connexion with a real essence of which we have no idea at all whatever species that supposed real essence may be imagined to constitute the truth of few universal propositions concerning substances is to be known on the other side the names of substances when made use of as they should be for the ideas men have in their minds though they carry a clear and determinate signification with them will not yet serve us to make many universal propositions of whose truth we can be certain not because in this use of them we are uncertain what things are signified by them but because the complex ideas they stand for are such combinations of simple ones as carry not with them any discoverable connexion or repugnancy but with a very few other ideas because necessary coexistence of simple ideas in substances can in few cases be known the complex ideas that our names of the species of substances properly stand for are collections of such qualities as have been observed to coexist in an unknown substratum which we call substance but what other qualities necessarily coexist with such combinations we cannot certainly know unless we can discover their natural dependence which in their primary qualities we can go but a very little way in and in all their secondary qualities we can discover no connexion at all for the reasons mentioned chap iii viz because we know not the real constitutions of substances on which each secondary quality particularly depends did we know that it would serve us only for experimental not universal knowledge and reach with certainty no further than that bare instance because our understandings can discover no conceivable connexion between any secondary quality and any modification whatsoever of any of the primary ones and therefore there are very few general propositions to be made concerning substances which can carry with them undoubted certainty instance in gold all gold is fixed is a proposition whose truth we cannot be certain of how universally soever it be believed for if according to the useless imagination of the schools any one supposes the term gold to stand for a species of things set out by nature by a real essence belonging to it it is evident he knows not what particular substances are of that species and so cannot with certainty affirm anything universally of gold but if he makes gold stand for a species determined by its nominal essence let the nominal essence for example be the complex idea of a body of a certain yellow colour malleable fusible and heavier than any other knownin this proper use of the word gold there is no difficulty to know what is or is not gold but yet no other quality can with certainty be universally affirmed or denied of gold but what hath a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with that nominal essence fixedness for example having no necessary connexion that we can discover with the colour weight or any other simple idea of our complex one or with the whole combination together it is impossible that we should certainly know the truth of this proposition that all gold is fixed no discoverable necessary connexion between nominal essence of gold and other simple ideas as there is no discoverable connexion between fixedness and the colour weight and other simple ideas of that nominal essence of gold so if we make our complex idea of gold a body yellow fusible ductile weighty and fixed we shall be at the same uncertainty concerning solubility in aqua regia and for the same reason since we can never from consideration of the ideas themselves with certainty affirm or deny of a body whose complex idea is made up of yellow very weighty ductile fusible and fixed that it is soluble in aqua regia and so on of the rest of its qualities i would gladly meet with one general affirmation concerning any quality of gold that any one can certainly know is true it will no doubt be presently objected is not this an universal proposition all gold is malleable to which i answer it is a very certain proposition if malleableness be a part of the complex idea the word gold stands for but then here is nothing affirmed of gold but that that sound stands for an idea in which malleableness is contained and such a sort of truth and certainty as this it is to say a centaur is fourfooted but if malleableness make not a part of the specific essence the name of gold stands for it is plain all gold is malleable is not a certain proposition because let the complex idea of gold be made up of whichsoever of its other qualities you please malleableness will not appear to depend on that complex idea nor follow from any simple one contained in it the connexion that malleableness has if it has any with those other qualities being only by the intervention of the real constitution of its insensible parts which since we know not it is impossible we should perceive that connexion unless we could discover that which ties them together as far as any such coexistence can be known so far universal propositions may be certain but this will go but a little way the more indeed of these coexisting qualities we unite into one complex idea under one name the more precise and determinate we make the signification of that word but never yet make it thereby more capable of universal certainty in respect of other qualities not contained in our complex idea since we perceive not their connexion or dependence on one another being ignorant both of that real constitution in which they are all founded and also how they flow from it for the chief part of our knowledge concerning substances is not as in other things barely of the relation of two ideas that may exist separately but is of the necessary connexion and coexistence of several distinct ideas in the same subject or of their repugnancy so to coexist could we begin at the other end and discover what it was wherein that colour consisted what made a body lighter or heavier what texture of parts made it malleable fusible and fixed and fit to be dissolved in this sort of liquor and not in anotherif i say we had such an idea as this of bodies and could perceive wherein all sensible qualities originally consist and how they are produced we might frame such abstract ideas of them as would furnish us with matter of more general knowledge and enable us to make universal propositions that should carry general truth and certainty with them but whilst our complex ideas of the sorts of substances are so remote from that internal real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend and are made up of nothing but an imperfect collection of those apparent qualities our senses can discover there can be few general propositions concerning substances of whose real truth we can be certainly assured since there are but few simple ideas of whose connexion and necessary coexistence we can have certain and undoubted knowledge i imagine amongst all the secondary qualities of substances and the powers relating to them there cannot any two be named whose necessary coexistence or repugnance to coexist can certainly be known unless in those of the same sense which necessarily exclude one another as i have elsewhere shown no one i think by the colour that is in any body can certainly know what smell taste sound or tangible qualities it has nor what alterations it is capable to make or receive on or from other bodies the same may be said of the sound or taste c our specific names of substances standing for any collections of such ideas it is not to be wondered that we can with them make very few general propositions of undoubted real certainty but yet so far as any complex idea of any sort of substances contains in it any simple idea whose necessary existence with any other may be discovered so far universal propositions may with certainty be made concerning it vg could any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and the colour or weight of gold or any other part of the complex idea signified by that name he might make a certain universal proposition concerning gold in this respect and the real truth of this proposition that all gold is malleable would be as certain as of this the three angles of all rightlined triangles are all equal to two right ones the qualities which make our complex ideas of substances depend mostly on external remote and unperceived causes had we such ideas of substances as to know what real constitutions produce those sensible qualities we find in them and how those qualities flowed from thence we could by the specific ideas of their real essences in our own minds more certainly find out their properties and discover what qualities they had or had not than we can now by our senses and to know the properties of gold it would be no more necessary that gold should exist and that we should make experiments upon it than it is necessary for the knowing the prop erties of a triangle that a triangle should exist in any matter the idea in our minds would serve for the one as well as the other but we are so far from being admitted into the secrets of nature that we scarce so much as ever approach the first entrance towards them for we are wont to consider the substances we meet with each of them as an entire thing by itself having all its qualities in itself and independent of other things overlooking for the most part the operations of those invisible fluids they are encompassed with and upon whose motions and operations depend the greatest part of those qualities which are taken notice of in them and are made by us the inherent marks of distinction whereby we know and denominate them put a piece of gold anywhere by itself separate from the reach and influence of all other bodies it will immediately lose all its colour and weight and perhaps malleableness too which for aught i know would be changed into a perfect friability water in which to us fluidity is an essential quality left to itself would cease to be fluid but if inanimate bodies owe so much of their present state to other bodies without them that they would not be what they appear to us were those bodies that environ them removed it is yet more so in vegetables which are nourished grow and produce leaves flowers and seeds in a constant succession and if we look a little nearer into the state of animals we shall find that their dependence as to life motion and the most considerable qualities to be observed in them is so wholly on extrinsical causes and qualities of other bodies that make no part of them that they cannot subsist a moment without them though yet those bodies on which they depend are little taken notice of and make no part of the complex ideas we frame of those animals take the air but for a minute from the greatest part of living creatures and they presently lose sense life and motion this the necessity of breathing has forced into our knowledge but how many other extrinsical and possibly very remote bodies do the springs of these admirable machines depend on which are not vulgarly observed or so much as thought on and how many are there which the severest inquiry can never discover the inhabitants of this spot of the universe though removed so many millions of miles from the sun yet depend so much on the duly tempered motion of particles coming from or agitated by it that were this earth removed but a small part of the distance out of its present situation and placed a little further or nearer that source of heat it is more than probable that the greatest part of the animals in it would immediately perish since we find them so often destroyed by an excess or defect of the suns warmth which an accidental position in some parts of this our little globe exposes them to the qualities observed in a loadstone must needs have their source far beyond the confines of that body and the ravage made often on several sorts of animals by invisible causes the certain death as we are told of some of them by barely passing the line or as it is certain of other by being removed into a neighbouring country evidently show that the concurrence and operations of several bodies with which they are seldom thought to have anything to do is absolutely necessary to make them be what they appear to us and to preserve those qualities by which we know and distinguish them we are then quite out of the way when we think that things contain within themselves the qualities that appear to us in them and we in vain search for that constitution within the body of a fly or an elephant upon which depend those qualities and powers we observe in them for which perhaps to understand them aright we ought to look not only beyond this our earth and atmosphere but even beyond the sun or remotest star our eyes have yet discovered for how much the being and operation of particular substances in this our globe depends on causes utterly beyond our view is impossible for us to determine we see and perceive some of the motions and grosser operations of things here about us but whence the streams come that keep all these curious machines in motion and repair how conveyed and modified is beyond our notice and apprehension and the great parts and wheels as i may say so of this stupendous structure of the universe may for aught we know have such a connexion and dependence in their influences and operations one upon another that perhaps things in this our mansion would put on quite another face and cease to be what they are if some one of the stars or great bodies incomprehensibly remote from us should cease to be or move as it does this is certain things however absolute and entire they seem in themselves are but retainers to other parts of nature for that which they are most taken notice of by us their observable qualities actions and powers are owing to something without them and there is not so complete and perfect a part that we know of nature which does not owe the being it has and the excellences of it to its neighbours and we must not confine our thoughts within the surface of any body but look a great deal further to comprehend perfectly those qualities that are in it our nominal essences of substances furnish few universal propositions about them that are certain if this be so it is not to be wondered that we have very imperfect ideas of substances and that the real essences on which depend their properties and operations are unknown to us we cannot discover so much as that size figure and texture of their minute and active parts which is really in them much less the different motions and impulses made in and upon them by bodies from without upon which depends and by which is formed the greatest and most remarkable part of those qualities we observe in them and of which our complex ideas of them are made up this consideration alone is enough to put an end to all our hopes of ever having the ideas of their real essences which whilst we want the nominal essences we make use of instead of them will be able to furnish us but very sparingly with any general knowledge or universal propositions capable of real certainty judgment of probability concerning substances may reach further but that is not knowledge we are not therefore to wonder if certainty be to be found in very few general propositions made concerning substances our knowledge of their qualities and properties goes very seldom further than our senses reach and inform us possibly inquisitive and observing men may by strength of judgment penetrate further and on probabilities taken from wary observation and hints well laid together often guess right at what experience has not yet discov ered to them but this is but guessing still it amounts only to opinion and has not that certainty which is requisite to knowledge for all general knowledge lies only in our own thoughts and consists barely in the contemplation of our own abstract ideas wherever we perceive any agreement or disagreement amongst them there we have general knowledge and by putting the names of those ideas together accordingly in propositions can with certainty pronounce general truths but because the abstract ideas of substances for which their specific names stand whenever they have any distinct and determinate signification have a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with but a very few other ideas the certainty of universal propositions concerning substances is very narrow and scanty in that part which is our principal inquiry concerning them and there are scarce any of the names of substances let the idea it is applied to be what it will of which we can generally and with certainty pronounce that it has or has not this or that other quality belonging to it and constantly coexisting or inconsistent with that idea wherever it is to be found what is requisite for our knowledge of substances before we can have any tolerable knowledge of this kind we must first know what changes the primary qualities of one body do regularly produce in the primary qualities of another and how secondly we must know what primary qualities of any body produce certain sensations or ideas in us this is in truth no less than to know all the effects of matter under its divers modifications of bulk figure cohesion of parts motion and rest which i think every body will allow is utterly impossible to be known by us without revelation nor if it were revealed to us what sort of figure bulk and motion of corpuscles would produce in us the sensation of a yellow colour and what sort of figure bulk and texture of parts in the superficies of any body were fit to give such corpuscles their due motion to produce that colour would that be enough to make universal propositions with certainty concerning the several sorts of them unless we had faculties acute enough to perceive the precise bulk figure texture and motion of bodies in those minute parts by which they operate on our senses so that we might by those frame our abstract ideas of them i have mentioned here only corporeal substances whose operations seem to lie more level to our understandings for as to the operations of spirits both their thinking and moving of bodies we at first sight find ourselves at a loss though perhaps when we have applied our thoughts a little nearer to the consideration of bodies and their operations and examined how far our notions even in these reach with any clearness beyond sensible matter of fact we shall be bound to confess that even in these too our discoveries amount to very little beyond perfect ignorance and incapacity whilst our complex ideas of substances contain not ideas of their real constitutions we can make but few general certain propositions concerning them this is evident the abstract complex ideas of substances for which their general names stand not comprehending their real constitutions can afford us very little universal certainty because our ideas of them are not made up of that on which those qualities we observe in them and would inform ourselves about do depend or with which they have any certain connexion vg let the ideas to which we give the name man be as it commonly is a body of the ordinary shape with sense voluntary motion and reason joined to it this being the abstract idea and consequently the essence of our species man we can make but very few general certain propositions concerning man standing for such an idea because not knowing the real constitution on which sensation power of motion and reasoning with that peculiar shape depend and whereby they are united together in the same subject there are very few other qualities with which we can perceive them to have a necessary connexion and therefore we cannot with certainty affirm that all men sleep by intervals that no man can be nourished by wood or stones that all men will be poisoned by hemlock because these ideas have no connexion nor repugnancy with this our nominal essence of man with this abstract idea that name stands for we must in these and the like appeal to trial in particular subjects which can reach but a little way we must content ourselves with probability in the rest but can have no general certainty whilst our specific idea of man contains not that real constitution which is the root wherein all his inseparable qualities are united and from whence they flow whilst our idea the word man stands for is only an imperfect collection of some sensible qualities and powers in him there is no discernible connexion or repugnance between our specific idea and the operation of either the parts of hemlock or stones upon his constitution there are animals that safely eat hemlock and others that are nourished by wood and stones but as long as we want ideas of those real constitutions of different sorts of animals whereon these and the like qualities and powers depend we must not hope to reach certainty in universal propositions concerning them those few ideas only which have a discernible connexion with our nominal essence or any part of it can afford us such propositions but these are so few and of so little moment that we may justly look on our certain general knowledge of substances as almost none at all wherein lies the general certainty of propositions to conclude general propositions of what kind soever are then only capable of certainty when the terms used in them stand for such ideas whose agreement or disagreement as there expressed is capable to be discovered by us and we are then certain of their truth or falsehood when we perceive the ideas the terms stand for to agree or not agree according as they are affirmed or denied one of another whence we may take notice that general certainty is never to be found but in our ideas whenever we go to seek it elsewhere in experiment or observations without us our knowledge goes not beyond particulars it is the contemplation of our own abstract ideas that alone is able to afford us general knowledge ii of maxims maxims or axioms are selfevident propositions there are a sort of propositions which under the name of maxims and axioms have passed for principles of science and because they are selfevident have been supposed in nate without that anybody that i know ever went about to show the reason and foundation of their clearness or cogency it may however be worth while to inquire into the reason of their evidence and see whether it be peculiar to them alone and also to examine how far they influence and govern our other knowledge wherein that selfevidence consists knowledge as has been shown consists in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas now where that agreement or disagreement is perceived immediately by itself without the intervention or help of any other there our knowledge is selfevident this will appear to be so to any who will but consider any of those propositions which without any proof he assents to at first sight for in all of them he will find that the reason of his assent is from that agreement or disagreement which the mind by an immediate comparing them finds in those ideas answering the affirmation or negation in the proposition selfevidence not peculiar to received axioms this being so in the next place let us consider whether this selfevidence be peculiar only to those propositions which commonly pass under the name of maxims and have the dignity of axioms allowed them and here it is plain that several other truths not allowed to be axioms partake equally with them in this selfevidence this we shall see if we go over these several sorts of agreement or disagreement of ideas which i have above mentioned viz identity relation coexistence and real existence which will discover to us that not only those few propositions which have had the credit of maxims are selfevident but a great many even almost an infinite number of other propositions are such i as to identity and diversity all propositions are equally selfevident for first the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of identity being founded in the minds having distinct ideas this affords us as many selfevident propositions as we have distinct ideas every one that has any knowledge at all has as the foundation of it various and distinct ideas and it is the first act of the mind without which it can never be capable of any knowledge to know every one of its ideas by itself and distinguish it from others every one finds in himself that he knows the ideas he has that he knows also when any one is in his understanding and what it is and that when more than one are there he knows them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another which always being so it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives he can never be in doubt when any idea is in his mind that it is there and is that idea it is and that two distinct ideas when they are in his mind are there and are not one and the same idea so that all such affirmations and negations are made without any possibility of doubt uncertainty or hesitation and must necessarily be assented to as soon as understood that is as soon as we have in our minds determined ideas which the terms in the proposition stand for and therefore whenever the mind with attention considers any proposition so as to perceive the two ideas signified by the terms and affirmed or denied one of the other to be the same or different it is presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition and this equally whether these propositions be in terms standing for more general ideas or such as are less so vg whether the general idea of being be affirmed of itself as in this proposition whatsoever is is or a more particular idea be affirmed of itself as a man is a man or whatsoever is white is white or whether the idea of being in general be denied of notbeing which is the only if i may so call it idea different from it as in this other proposition it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be or any idea of any particular being be denied of another different from it as a man is not a horse red is not blue the difference of the ideas as soon as the terms are understood makes the truth of the proposition presently visible and that with an equal certainty and easiness in the less as well as the more general propositions and all for the same reason viz because the mind perceives in any ideas that it has the same idea to be the same with itself and two different ideas to be different and not the same and this it is equally certain of whether these ideas be more or less general abstract and comprehensive it is not therefore alone to these two general propositionswhatsoever is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that this sort of selfevidence belongs by any peculiar right the perception of being or not being belongs no more to these vague ideas signified by the terms whatsoever and thing than it does to any other ideas these two general maxims amounting to no more in short but this that the same is the same and the same is not different are truths known in more particular instances as well as in those general maxims and known also in particular instances before these general maxims are ever thought on and draw all their force from the discernment of the mind employed about particular ideas there is nothing more visible than that the mind without the help of any proof or reflection on either of these general propositions perceives so clearly and knows so certainly that the idea of white is the idea of white and not the idea of blue and that the idea of white when it is in the mind is there and is not absent that the consideration of these axioms can add nothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge just so it is as every one may experiment in himself in all the ideas a man has in his mind he knows each to be itself and not to be another and to be in his mind and not away when it is there with a certainty that cannot be greater and therefore the truth of no general proposition can be known with a greater certainty nor add anything to this so that in respect of identity our intuitive knowledge reaches as far as our ideas and we are capable of making as many selfevident propositions as we have names for distinct ideas and i appeal to every ones own mind whether this proposition a circle is a circle be not as selfevident a proposition as that consisting of more general terms whatsoever is is and again whether this proposition blue is not red be not a proposition that the mind can no more doubt of as soon as it understands the words than it does of that axiom it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and so of all the like ii in coexistence we have few selfevident propositions secondly as to coexistence or such a necessary connexion between two ideas that in the subject where one of them is supposed there the other must necessarily be also of such agreement or disagreement as this the mind has an immediate perception but in very few of them and therefore in this sort we have but very little intuitive knowledge nor are there to be found very many propositions that are selfevident though some there are vg the idea of filling a place equal to the contents of its superficies being annexed to our idea of body i think it is a selfevident proposition that two bodies cannot be in the same place iii in other relations we may have many thirdly as to the relations of modes mathematicians have framed many axioms concerning that one relation of equality as equals taken from equals the remainder will be equal which with the rest of that kind however they are received for maxims by the mathematicians and are unquestionable truths yet i think that any one who considers them will not find that they have a clearer selfevidence than thesethat one and one are equal to two that if you take from the five fingers of one hand two and from the five fingers of the other hand two the remaining numbers will be equal these and a thousand other such propositions may be found in numbers which at the very first hearing force the assent and carry with them an equal if not greater clearness than those mathematical axioms iv concerning real existence we have none fourthly as to real existence since that has no connexion with any other of our ideas but that of ourselves and of a first being we have in that concerning the real existence of all other beings not so much as demonstrative much less a selfevident knowledge and therefore concerning those there are no maxims these axioms do not much influence our other knowledge in the next place let us consider what influence these received maxims have upon the other parts of our knowledge the rules established in the schools that all reasonings are ex praeognitis et praeconcessis seem to lay the foundation of all other knowledge in these maxims and to suppose them to be praecognita whereby i think are meant these two things first that these axioms are those truths that are first known to the mind and secondly that upon them the other parts of our knowledge depend because maxims or axioms are not the truths we first knew first that they are not the truths first known to the mind is evident to experience as we have shown in another place bk i chap i who perceives not that a child certainly knows that a stranger is not its mother that its suckingbottle is not the rod long before he knows that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and how many truths are there about numbers which it is obvious to observe that the mind is perfectly acquainted with and fully convinced of before it ever thought on these general maxims to which mathematicians in their arguings do sometimes refer them whereof the reason is very plain for that which makes the mind assent to such propositions being nothing else but the perception it has of the agreement or disagreement of its ideas according as it finds them affirmed or denied one of another in words it understands and every idea being known to be what it is and every two distinct ideas being known not to be the same it must necessarily follow that such selfevident truths must be first known which consist of ideas that are first in the mind and the ideas first in the mind it is evident are those of particular things from whence by slow degrees the understanding proceeds to some few general ones which being taken from the ordinary and familiar objects of sense are settled in the mind with general names to them thus particular ideas are first received and distinguished and so knowledge got about them and next to them the less general or specific which are next to particular for abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine for example does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which is yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together it is true the mind in this imperfect state has need of such ideas and makes all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it is naturally very much inclined but yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection at least this is enough to show that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with nor such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about because on perception of them the other parts of our knowledge do not depend secondly from what has been said it plainly follows that these magnified maxims are not the principles and foundations of all our other knowledge for if there be a great many other truths which have as much selfevidence as they and a great many that we know before them it is impossible they should be the principles from which we deduce all other truths is it impossible to know that one and two are equal to three but by virtue of this or some such axiom viz the whole is equal to all its parts taken together many a one knows that one and two are equal to three without having heard or thought on that or any other axiom by which it might be proved and knows it as certainly as any other man knows that the whole is equal to all its parts or any other maxim and all from the same reason of selfevidence the equality of those ideas being as visible and certain to him without that or any other axiom as with it it needing no proof to make it perceived nor after the knowledge that the whole is equal to all its parts does he know that one and two are equal to three better or more certainly than he did before for if there be any odds in those ideas the whole and parts are more obscure or at least more difficult to be settled in the mind than those of one two and three and indeed i think i may ask these men who will needs have all knowledge besides those general principles themselves to depend on general innate and selfevident principles what principle is requisite to prove that one and one are two that two and two are four that three times two are six which being known without any proof do evince that either all knowledge does not depend on certain praecognita or general maxims called principles or else that these are principles and if these are to be counted principles a great part of numeration will be so to which if we add all the selfevident propositions which may be made about all our distinct ideas principles will be almost infinite at least innumerable which men arrive to the knowledge of at different ages and a great many of these innate principles they never come to know all their lives but whether they come in view of the mind earlier or later this is true of them that they are all known by their native evidence are wholly independent receive no light nor are capable of any proof one from another much less the more particular from the more general or the more simple from the more compounded the more simple and less abstract being the most familiar and the easier and earlier apprehended but whichever be the clearest ideas the evidence and certainty of all such propositions is in this that a man sees the same idea to be the same idea and infallibly perceives two different ideas to be different ideas for when a man has in his understanding the ideas of one and of two the idea of yellow and the idea of blue he cannot but certainly know that the idea of one is the idea of one and not the idea of two and that the idea of yellow is the idea of yellow and not the idea of blue for a man cannot confound the ideas in his mind which he has distinct that would be to have them confused and distinct at the same time which is a contradiction and to have none distinct is to have no use of our faculties to have no knowledge at all and therefore what idea soever is affirmed of itself or whatsoever two entire distinct ideas are denied one of another the mind cannot but assent to such a proposition as infallibly true as soon as it understands the terms without hesitation or need of proof or regarding those made in more general terms and called maxims what use these general maxims or axioms have what shall we then say are these general maxims of no use by no means though perhaps their use is not that which it is commonly taken to be but since doubting in the least of what hath been by some men ascribed to these maxims may be apt to be cried out against as overturning the foundations of all the sciences it may be worth while to consider them with respect to other parts of our knowledge and examine more particularly to what purposes they serve and to what not it is evident from what has been already said that they are of no use to prove or confirm less general selfevident propositions it is as plain that they are not nor have been the foundations whereon any science hath been built there is i know a great deal of talk propagated from scholastic men of sciences and the maxims on which they are built but it has been my illluck never to meet with any such sciences much less any one built upon these two maxims what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and i would be glad to be shown where any such science erected upon these or any other general axioms is to be found and should be obliged to any one who would lay before me the frame and system of any science so built on these or any such like maxims that could not be shown to stand as firm without any consideration of them i ask whether these general maxims have not the same use in the study of divinity and in theological questions that they have in other sciences they serve here too to silence wranglers and put an end to dispute but i think that nobody will therefore say that the christian religion is built upon these maxims or that the knowledge we have of it is derived from these principals it is from revelation we have received it and without revelation these maxims had never been able to help us to it when we find out an idea by whose intervention we discover the connexion of two others this is a revelation from god to us by the voice of reason for we then come to know a truth that we did not know before when god declares any truth to us this is a revelation to us by the voice of his spirit and we are advanced in our knowledge but in neither of these do we receive our light or knowledge from maxims but in the one the things themselves afford it and we see the truth in them by perceiving their agreement or disagreement in the other god himself affords it immediately to us and we see the truth of what he says in his unerring veracity they are not of use to help men forward in the advancement of sciences or new discoveries of yet unknown truths mr newton in his never enough to be admired book has demonstrated several propositions which are so many new truths before unknown to the world and are further advances in mathematical knowledge but for the discovery of these it was not the general maxims what is is or the whole is bigger than a part or the like that helped him these were not the clues that led him into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those propositions nor was it by them that he got the knowledge of those demonstrations but by finding out intermediate ideas that showed the agreement or disagreement of the ideas as expressed in the propositions he demonstrated this is the greatest exercise and improvement of human understanding in the enlarging of knowledge and advancing the sciences wherein they are far enough from receiving any help from the contemplation of these or the like magnified maxims would those who have this traditional admiration of these propositions that they think no step can be made in knowledge without the support of an axiom no stone laid in the building of the sciences without a general maxim but distinguish between the method of acquiring knowledge and of communicating it between the method of raising any science and that of teaching it to others as far as it is advancedthey would see that those general maxims were not the foundations on which the first discoverers raised their admirable structures not the keys that unlocked and opened those secrets of knowledge though afterwards when schools were erected and sciences had their professors to teach what others had found out they often made use of maxims ie laid down certain propositions which were selfevident or to be received for true which being settled in the minds of their scholars as unquestionable verities they on occasion made use of to convince them of truths in particular instances that were not so familiar to their minds as those general axioms which had before been inculcated to them and carefully settled in their minds though these particular instances when well reflected on are no less selfevident to the understanding than the general maxims brought to confirm them and it was in those particular instances that the first discoverer found the truth without the help of the general maxims and so may any one else do who with attention considers them maxims of use in the exposition of what has been discovered and in silencing obstinate wranglers to come therefore to the use that is made of maxims they are of use as has been observed in the ordinary methods of teaching sciences as far as they are advanced but of little or none in advancing them further they are of use in disputes for the silencing of obstinate wranglers and bringing those contests to some conclusion whether a need of them to that end came not in the manner following i crave leave to inquire the schools having made disputation the touchstone of mens abilities and the criterion of knowledge adjudged victory to him that kept the field and he that had the last word was concluded to have the better of the argument if not of the cause but because by this means there was like to be no decision between skilful combatants whilst one never failed of a medius terminus to prove any proposition and the other could as constantly without or with a distinction deny the major or minor to prevent as much as could be running out of disputes into an endless train of syllogisms certain general propositionsmost of them indeed selfevidentwere introduced into the schools which being such as all men allowed and agreed in were looked on as general measures of truth and served instead of principles where the disputants had not lain down any other between them beyond which there was no going and which must not be receded from by either side and thus these maxims getting the name of principles beyond which men in dispute could not retreat were by mistake taken to be the originals and sources from whence all knowledge began and the foundations whereon the sciences were built because when in their disputes they came to any of these they stopped there and went no further the matter was determined but how much this is a mistake hath been already shown how maxims came to be so much in vogue this method of the schools which have been thought the fountains of knowledge introduced as i suppose the like use of these maxims into a great part of conversation out of the schools to stop the mouths of cavillers whom any one is excused from arguing any longer with when they deny these general selfevident principles received by all reasonable men who have once thought of them but yet their use herein is but to put an end to wrangling they in truth when urged in such cases teach nothing that is already done by the intermediate ideas made use of in the debate whose connexion may be seen without the help of those maxims and so the truth known before the maxim is produced and the argument brought to a first principle men would give off a wrong argument before it came to that if in their disputes they proposed to themselves the finding and embracing of truth and not a contest for victory and thus maxims have their use to put a stop to their perverseness whose ingenuity should have yielded sooner but the method of the schools having allowed and encouraged men to oppose and resist evident truth till they are baffled ie till they are reduced to contradict themselves or some established principles it is no wonder that they should not in civil conversation be ashamed of that which in the schools is counted a virtue and a glory viz obstinately to maintain that side of the question they have chosen whether true or false to the last extremity even after conviction a strange way to attain truth and knowledge and that which i think the rational part of mankind not corrupted by education could scarce believe should ever be admitted amongst the lovers of truth and students of religion or nature or introduced into the seminaries of those who are to propagate the truths of religion or philosophy amongst the ignorant and unconvinced how much such a way of learning is like to turn young mens minds from the sincere search and love of truth nay and to make them doubt whether there is any such thing or at least worth the adhering to i shall not now inquire this i think that bating those places which brought the peripatetick philosophy into their schools where it continued many ages without teaching the world anything but the art of wrangling these maxims were nowhere thought the foundations on which the sciences were built nor the great helps to the advancement of knowledge of great use to stop wranglers in disputes but of little use to the discovery of truths as to these general maxims therefore they are as i have said of great use in disputes to stop the mouths of wranglers but not of much use to the discovery of unknown truths or to help the mind forwards in its search after knowledge for who ever began to build his knowledge on the general proposition what is is or it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and from either of these as from a principle of science deduced a system of useful knowledge wrong opinions often involving contradictions one of these maxims as a touchstone may serve well to show whither they lead but yet however fit to lay open the absurdity or mistake of a mans reasoning or opinion they are of very little use for enlightening the understanding and it will not be found that the mind receives much help from them in its progress in knowledge which would be neither less nor less certain were these two general propositions never thought on it is true as i have said they sometimes serve in argumentation to stop a wranglers mouth by showing the absurdity of what he saith and by exposing him to the shame of contradicting what all the world knows and he himself cannot but own to be true but it is one thing to show a man that he is in an error and another to put him in possession of truth and i would fain know what truths these two propositions are able to teach and by their influence make us know which we did not know before or could not know without them let us reason from them as well as we can they are only about identical predications and influence if any at all none but such each particular proposition concerning identity or diversity is as clearly and certainly known in itself if attended to as either of these general ones only these general ones as serving in all cases are therefore more inculcated and insisted on as to other less general maxims many of them are no more than bare verbal propositions and teach us nothing but the respect and import of names one to another the whole is equal to all its parts what real truth i beseech you does it teach us what more is contained in that maxim than what the signification of the word totum or the whole does of itself import and he that knows that the word whole stands for what is made up of all its parts knows very little less than that the whole is equal to all its parts and upon the same ground i think that this proposition a hill is higher than a valley and several the like may also pass for maxims but yet masters of mathematics when they would as teachers of what they know initiate others in that science do not without reason place this and some other such maxims at the entrance of their systems that their scholars having in the beginning perfectly acquainted their thoughts with these propositions made in such general terms may be used to make such reflections and have these more general propositions as formed rules and sayings ready to apply to all particular cases not that if they be equally weighed they are more clear and evident than the particular instances they are brought to confirm but that being more familiar to the mind the very naming them is enough to satisfy the understanding but this i say is more from our custom of using them and the establishment they have got in our minds by our often thinking of them than from the different evidence of the things but before custom has settled methods of thinking and reasoning in our minds i am apt to imagine it is quite otherwise and that the child when a part of his apple is taken away knows it better in that particular instance than by this general proposition the whole is equal to all its parts and that if one of these have need to be confirmed to him by the other the general has more need to be let into his mind by the particular than the par ticular by the general for in particulars our knowledge begins and so spreads itself by degrees to generals though afterwards the mind takes the quite contrary course and having drawn its knowledge into as general propositions as it can makes those familiar to its thoughts and accustoms itself to have recourse to them as to the standards of truth and falsehood by which familiar use of them as rules to measure the truth of other propositions it comes in time to be thought that more particular propositions have their truth and evidence from their conformity to these more general ones which in discourse and argumentation are so frequently urged and constantly admitted and this i think to be the reason why amongst so many selfevident propositions the most general only have had the title of maxims maxims if care he not taken in the use of words may prove contradictions one thing further i think it may not be amiss to observe concerning these general maxims that they are so far from improving or establishing our minds in true knowledge that if our notions be wrong loose or unsteady and we resign up our thoughts to the sound of words rather than fix them on settled determined ideas of things i say these general maxims will serve to confirm us in mistakes and in such a way of use of words which is most common will serve to prove contradictions vg he that with descartes shall frame in his mind an idea of what he calls body to be nothing but extension may easily demonstrate that there is no vacuum ie no space void of body by this maxim what is is for the idea to which he annexes the name body being bare extension his knowledge that space cannot be without body is certain for he knows his own idea of extension clearly and distinctly and knows that it is what it is and not another idea though it be called by these three namesextension body space which three words standing for one and the same idea may no doubt with the same evidence and certainty be affirmed one of another as each of itself and it is as certain that whilst i use them all to stand for one and the same idea this predication is as true and identical in its signification that space is body as this predication is true and identical that body is body both in signification and sound instance in vacuum but if another should come and make to himself another idea different from descartess of the thing which yet with descartes he calls by the same name body and make his idea which he expresses by the word body to be of a thing that hath both extension and solidity together he will as easily demonstrate that there may be a vacuum or space without a body as descartes demonstrated the contrary because the idea to which he gives the name space being barely the simple one of extension and the idea to which he gives the name body being the complex idea of extension and resistibility or solidity together in the same subject these two ideas are not exactly one and the same but in the understanding as distinct as the ideas of one and two white and black or as of corporeity and humanity if i may use those barbarous terms and therefore the predication of them in our minds or in words standing for them is not identical but the negation of them one of another viz this proposition extension or space is not body is as true and evidently certain as this maxim it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be can make any proposition but they prove not the existence of things without us but yet though both these propositions as you see may be equally demonstrated viz that there may be a vacuum and that there cannot be a vacuum by these two certain principles viz what is is and the same thing cannot be and not be yet neither of these principles will serve to prove to us that any or what bodies do exist for that we are left to our senses to discover to us as far as they can those universal and selfevident principles being only our constant clear and distinct knowledge of our own ideas more general or comprehensive can assure us of nothing that passes without the mind their certainty is founded only upon the knowledge we have of each idea by itself and of its distinction from others about which we cannot be mistaken whilst they are in our minds though we may be and often are mistaken when we retain the names without the ideas or use them confusedly sometimes for one and sometimes for another idea in which cases the force of these axioms reaching only to the sound and not the signification of the words serves only to lead us into confusion mistake and error it is to show men that these maxims however cried up for the great guards of truth will not secure them from error in a careless loose use of their words that i have made this remark in all that is here suggested concerning their little use for the improvement of knowledge or dangerous use in undetermined ideas i have been far enough from saying or intending they should be laid aside as some have been too forward to charge me i affirm them to be truths selfevident truths and so cannot be laid aside as far as their influence will reach it is in vain to endeavour nor will i attempt to abridge it but yet without any injury to truth or knowledge i may have reason to think their use is not answerable to the great stress which seems to be laid on them and i may warn men not to make an ill use of them for the confirming themselves in errors they cannot add to our knowledge of substances and their application to complex ideas is dangerous but let them be of what use they will in verbal propositions they cannot discover or prove to us the least knowledge of the nature of substances as they are found and exist without us any further than grounded on experience and though the consequence of these two propositions called principles be very clear and their use not dangerous or hurtful in the probation of such things wherein there is no need at all of them for proof but such as are clear by themselves without them viz where our ideas are determined and known by the names that stand for them yet when these principles viz what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be are made use of in the probation of propositions wherein are words standing for complex ideas vg man horse gold virtue there they are of infinite danger and most commonly make men receive and retain falsehood for manifest truth and uncertainty for demonstration upon which follow error obstinacy and all the mischiefs that can happen from wrong reasoning the reason whereof is not that these principles are less true or of less force in proving propositions made of terms standing for complex ideas than where the propositions are about simple ideas but because men mistake generallythinking that where the same terms are preserved the propositions are about the same things though the ideas they stand for are in truth different therefore these maxims are made use of to support those which in sound and appearance are contradictory propositions and is clear in the demonstrations above mentioned about a vacuum so that whilst men take words for things as usually they do these maxims may and do commonly serve to prove contradictory propositions as shall yet be further made manifest instance in demonstrations about man which can only be verbal for instance let man be that concerning which you would by these first principles demonstrate anything and we shall see that so far as demonstration is by these principles it is only verbal and gives us no certain universal true proposition or knowledge of any being existing without us first a child having framed the idea of a man it is probable that his idea is just like that picture which the painter makes of the visible appearances joined together and such a complication of ideas together in his understanding makes up the single complex idea which he calls man whereof white or fleshcolour in england being one the child can demonstrate to you that a negro is not a man because white colour was one of the constant simple ideas of the complex idea he calls man and therefore he can demonstrate by the principle it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that a negro is not a man the foundation of his certainty being not that universal proposition which perhaps he never heard nor thought of but the clear distinct perception he hath of his own simple ideas of black and white which he cannot be persuaded to take nor can ever mistake one for another whether he knows that maxim or no and to this child or any one who hath such an idea which he calls man can you never demonstrate that a man hath a soul because his idea of man includes no such notion or idea in it and therefore to him the principle of what is is proves not this matter but it depends upon collection and observation by which he is to make his complex idea called man another instance secondly another that hath gone further in framing and collecting the idea he calls man and to the outward shape adds laughter and rational discourse may demonstrate that infants and changelings are no men by this maxim it is impossible for the same thing to he and not to be and i have discoursed with very rational men who have actually denied that they are men a third instance thirdly perhaps another makes up the complex idea which he calls man only out of the ideas of body in general and the powers of language and reason and leaves out the shape wholly this man is able to demonstrate that a man may have no hands but be quadrupes neither of those being included in his idea of man and in whatever body or shape he found speech and reason joined that was a man because having a clear knowledge of such a complex idea it is certain that what is is little use of these maxims in proofs where we have clear and distinct ideas so that if rightly considered i think we may say that where our ideas are determined in our minds and have annexed to them by us known and steady names under those settled determinations there is little need or no use at all of these maxims to prove the agreement or disagreement of any of them he that cannot discern the truth or falsehood of such propositions without the help of these and the like maxims will not be helped by these maxims to do it since he cannot be supposed to know the truth of these maxims themselves without proof if he cannot know the truth of others without proof which are as selfevident as these upon this ground it is that intuitive knowledge neither requires nor admits any proof one part of it more than another he that will suppose it does takes away the foundation of all knowledge and certainty and he that needs any proof to make him certain and give his assent to this proposition that two are equal to two will also have need of a proof to make him admit that what is is he that needs a probation to convince him that two are not three that white is not black that a triangle is not a circle c or any other two determined distinct ideas are not one and the same will need also a demonstration to convince him that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be their use dangerous where our ideas are not determined and as these maxims are of little use where we have determined ideas so they are as i have shown of dangerous use where our ideas are not determined and where we use words that are not annexed to determined ideas but such as are of a loose and wandering signification sometimes standing for one and sometimes for another idea from which follow mistake and error which these maxims brought as proofs to establish propositions wherein the terms stand for undetermined ideas do by their authority confirm and rivet iii of trifling propositions some propositions bring no increase to our knowledge whether the maxims treated of in the foregoing chapter be of that use to real knowledge as is generally supposed i leave to be considered this i think may confidently be affirmed that there are universal propositions which though they be certainly true yet they add no light to our understanding bring no increase to our knowledge such are i as identical propositions first all purely identical propositions these obviously and at first blush appear to contain no instruction in them for when we affirm the said term of itself whether it be barely verbal or whether it contains any clear and real idea it shows us nothing but what we must certainly know before whether such a proposition be either made by or proposed to us indeed that most general one what is is may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he is guilty of when by circumlocution or equivocal terms he would in particular instances deny the same thing of itself because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense as to affirm visible and direct contradictions in plain words or if he does a man is excused if he breaks off any further discourse with him but yet i think i may say that neither that received maxim nor any other identical proposition teaches us anything and though in such kind of propositions this great and magnified maxim boasted to be the foundation of demonstration may be and often is made use of to confirm them yet all it proves amounts to no more than this that the same word may with great certainty be affirmed of itself without any doubt of the truth of any such proposition and let me add also without any real knowledge examples for at this rate any very ignorant person who can but make a proposition and knows what he means when he says ay or no may make a million of propositions of whose truth he may be infallibly certain and yet not know one thing in the world thereby vg what is a soul is a soul or a soul is a soul a spirit is a spirit a fetiche is a fetiche c these all being equivalent to this proposition viz what is is ie what hath existence hath existence or who hath a soul hath a soul what is this more than trifling with words it is but like a monkey shifting his oyster from one hand to the other and had he but words might no doubt have said oyster in right hand is subject and oyster in left hand is predicate and so might have made a selfevident proposition of oyster ie oyster is oyster and yet with all this not have been one whit the wiser or more knowing and that way of handling the matter would much at once have satisfied the monkeys hunger or a mans understanding and they would have improved in knowledge and bulk together how identical propositions are trifling i know there are some who because identical propositions are selfevident show a great concern for them and think they do great service to philosophy by crying them up as if in them was contained all knowledge and the understanding were led into all truth by them only i grant as forwardly as any one that they are all true and selfevident i grant further that the foundation of all our knowledge lies in the faculty we have of perceiving the same idea to be the same and of discerning it from those that are different as i have shown in the foregoing chapter but how that vindicates the making use of identical propositions for the improvement of knowl edge from the imputation of trifling i do not see let any one repeat as often as he pleases that the will is the will or lay what stress on it he thinks fit of what use is this and an infinite the like propositions for the enlarging our knowledge let a man abound as much as the plenty of words which he has will permit in such propositions as these a law is a law and obligation is obligation right is right and wrong is wrong will these and the like ever help him to an acquaintance with ethics or instruct him or others in the knowledge of morality those who know not nor perhaps ever will know what is right and what is wrong nor the measures of them can with as much assurance make and infallibly know the truth of these and all such propositions as he that is best instructed in morality can do but what advance do such propositions give in the knowledge of anything necessary or useful for their conduct he would be thought to do little less than trifle who for the enlightening the understanding in any part of knowledge should be busy with identical propositions and insist on such maxims as these substance is substance and body is body a vacuum is a vacuum and a vortex is a vortex a centaur is a centaur and a chimera is a chimera c for these and all such are equally true equally certain and equally selfevident but yet they cannot but be counted trifling when made use of as principles of instruction and stress laid on them as helps to knowledge since they teach nothing but what every one who is capable of discourse knows without being told viz that the same term is the same term and the same idea the same idea and upon this account it was that i formerly did and do still think the offering and inculcating such propositions in order to give the understanding any new light or inlet into the knowledge of things no better than trifling instruction lies in something very different and he that would enlarge his own or anothers mind to truths he does not yet know must find out intermediate ideas and then lay them in such order one by another that the understanding may see the agreement or disagreement of those in question propositions that do this are instructive but they are far from such as affirm the same term of itself which is no way to advance ones self or others in any sort of knowledge it no more helps to that than it would help any one in his learning to read to have such propositions as these inculcated to himan a is an a and a b is a b which a man may know as well as any schoolmaster and yet never be able to read a word as long as he lives nor do these or any such identical propositions help him one jot forwards in the skill of reading let him make what use of them he can if those who blame my calling them trifling propositions had but read and been at the pains to understand what i have above writ in very plain english they could not but have seen that by identical propositions i mean only such wherein the same term importing the same idea is affirmed of itself which i take to be the proper signification of identical propositions and concerning all such i think i may continue safely to say that to propose them as instructive is no better than trifling for no one who has the use of reason can miss them where it is necessary they should be taken notice of nor doubt of their truth when he does take notice of them but if men will call propositions identical wherein the same term is not affirmed of itself whether they speak more properly than i others must judge this is certain all that they say of propositions that are not identical in my sense concerns not me nor what i have said all that i have said relating to those propositions wherein the same term is affirmed of itself and i would fain see an instance wherein any such can be made use of to the advantage and improvement of any ones knowledge instances of other kinds whatever use may be made of them concern not me as not being such as i call identical ii secondly propositions in which a part of any complex idea is predicated of the whole another sort of trifling propositions is when a part of the complex idea is predicated of the name of the whole a part of the definition of the word defined such are all propositions wherein the genus is predicated of the species or more comprehensive of less comprehensive terms for what information what knowledge carries this proposition in it viz lead is a metal to a man who knows the complex idea the name lead stands for all the simple ideas that go to the complex one signified by the term metal being nothing but what he before comprehended and signified by the name lead indeed to a man that knows the signification of the word metal and not of the word lead it is a shorter way to explain the signification of the word lead by saying it is a metal which at once expresses several of its simple ideas than to enumerate them one by one telling him it is a body very heavy fusible and malleable as part of the definition of the term defined alike trifling it is to predicate any other part of the definition of the term defined or to affirm any one of the simple ideas of a complex one of the name of the whole complex idea as all gold is fusible for fusibility being one of the simple ideas that goes to the making up the complex one the sound gold stands for what can it be but playing with sounds to affirm that of the name gold which is comprehended in its received signification it would be thought little better than ridiculous to affirm gravely as a truth of moment that gold is yellow and i see not how it is any jot more material to say it is fusible unless that quality be left out of the complex idea of which the sound gold is the mark in ordinary speech what instruction can it carry with it to tell one that which he hath been told already or he is supposed to know before for i am supposed to know the signification of the word another uses to me or else he is to tell me and if i know that the name gold stands for this complex idea of body yellow heavy fusible malleable it will not much instruct me to put it solemnly afterwards in a proposition and gravely say all gold is fusible such propositions can only serve to show the disingenuity of one who will go from the definition of his own terms by reminding him sometimes of it but carry no knowledge with them but of the signification of words however certain they be instance man and palfrey every man is an animal or living body is as certain a proposition as can be but no more conducing to the knowledge of things than to say a palfrey is an ambling horse or a neighing ambling animal both being only about the signification of words and make me know but thisthat body sense and motion or power of sensation and moving are three of those ideas that i always comprehend and signify by the word man and where they are not to be found together the name man belongs not to that thing and so of the otherthat body sense and a certain way of going with a certain kind of voice are some of those ideas which i always comprehend and signify by the word palfrey and when they are not to be found together the name palfrey belongs not to that thing it is just the same and to the same purpose when any term standing for any one or more of the simple ideas that altogether make up that complex idea which is called man is affirmed of the term manvg suppose a roman signified by the word homo all these distinct ideas united in one subject corporietas sensibilitas potentia se movendi rationalitas risibilitas he might no doubt with great certainty universally affirm one more or all of these together of the word homo but did no more than say that the word homo in his country comprehended in its signification all these ideas much like a romance knight who by the word palfrey signified these ideasbody of a certain figure fourlegged with sense motion ambling neighing white used to have a woman on his backmight with the same certainty universally affirm also any or all of these of the word palfrey but did thereby teach no more but that the word palfrey in his or romance language stood for all these and was not to be applied to anything where any of these was wanting but he that shall tell me that in whatever thing sense motion reason and laughter were united that thing had actually a notion of god or would be cast into a sleep by opium made indeed an instructive proposition because neither having the notion of god nor being cast into sleep by opium being contained in the idea signified by the word man we are by such propositions taught something more than barely what the word man stands for and therefore the knowledge contained in it is more than verbal for this teaches but the signification of words before a man makes any proposition he is supposed to understand the terms he uses in it or else he talks like a parrot only making a noise by imitation and framing certain sounds which he has learnt of others but not as a rational creature using them for signs of ideas which he has in his mind the hearer also is supposed to understand the terms as the speaker uses them or else he talks jargon and makes an unintelligible noise and therefore he trifles with words who makes such a proposition which when it is made contains no more than one of the terms does and which a man was supposed to know before vg a triangle hath three sides or saffron is yellow and this is no further tolerable than where a man goes to explain his terms to one who is supposed or declares himself not to understand him and then it teaches only the signification of that word and the use of that sign but adds no real knowledge we can know then the truth of two sorts of propositions with perfect certainty the one is of those trifling propositions which have a certainty in them but it is only a verbal certainty but not instructive and secondly we can know the truth and so may be certain in propositions which affirm something of another which is a necessary consequence of its precise complex idea but not contained in it as that the external angle of all triangles is bigger than either of the opposite internal angles which relation of the outward angle to either of the opposite internal angles making no part of the complex idea signified by the name triangle this is a real truth and conveys with it instructive real knowledge general propositions concerning substances are often trifling we having little or no knowledge of what combinations there be of simple ideas existing together in substances but by our senses we cannot make any universal certain propositions concerning them any further than our nominal essences lead us which being to a very few and inconsiderable truths in respect of those which depend on their real constitutions the general propositions that are made about substances if they are certain are for the most part but trifling and if they are instructive are uncertain and such as we can have no knowledge of their real truth how much soever constant observation and analogy may assist our judgment in guessing hence it comes to pass that one may often meet with very clear and coherent discourses that amount yet to nothing for it is plain that names of substantial beings as well as others as far as they have relative significations affixed to them may with great truth be joined negatively and affirmatively in propositions as their relative definitions make them fit to be so joined and propositions consisting of such terms may with the same clearness be deduced one from another as those that convey the most real truths and all this without any knowledge of the nature or reality of things existing without us by this method one may make demonstrations and undoubted propositions in words and yet thereby advance not one jot in the knowledge of the truth of things vg he that having learnt these following words with their ordinary mutual relative acceptations annexed to them vg substance man animal form soul vegetative sensitive rational may make several undoubted propositions about the soul without knowing at all what the soul really is and of this sort a man may find an infinite number of propositions reasonings and conclusions in books of metaphysics schooldivinity and some sort of natural philosophy and after all know as little of god spirits or bodies as he did before he set out and why he that hath liberty to define ie to determine the signification of his names of substances as certainly every one does in effect who makes them stand for his own ideas and makes their significations at a venture taking them from his own or other mens fancies and not from an examination or inquiry into the nature of things themselves may with little trouble demonstrate them one of another according to those several respects and mutual relations he has given them one to another wherein however things agree or disagree in their own nature he needs mind nothing but his own notions with the names he hath bestowed upon them but thereby no more increases in his own knowledge than he does his riches who taking a bag of counters calls one in a certain place a pound another in another place a shilling and a third in a third place a penny and so proceeding may undoubtedly reckon right and cast up a great sum according to his counters so placed and standing for more or less as he pleases without being one jot the richer or without even knowing how much a pound shilling or penny is but only that one is contained in the other twenty times and contains the other twelve which a man may also do in the signification of words by making them in respect of one another more or less or equally comprehensive thirdly using words variously is trifling with them though yet concerning most words used in discourses equally argumentative and controversial there is this more to be complained of which is the worst sort of trifling and which sets us yet further from the certainty of knowledge we hope to attain by them or find in them viz that most writers are so far from instructing us in the nature and knowledge of things that they use their words loosely and uncertainly and do not by using them constantly and steadily in the same significations make plain and clear deductions of words one from another and make their discourses coherent and clear how little soever they were instructive which were not difficult to do did they not find it convenient to shelter their ignorance or obstinacy under the obscurity and perplexedness of their terms to which perhaps inadvertency and ill custom do in many men much contribute marks of verbal propositions to conclude barely verbal propositions may be known by these following marks predication in abstract first all propositions wherein two abstract terms are affirmed one of another are barely about the signification of sounds for since no abstract idea can be the same with any other but itself when its abstract name is affirmed of any other term it can signify no more but this that it may or ought to be called by that name or that these two names signify the same idea thus should any one say that parsimony is frugality that gratitude is justice that this or that action is or is not temperate however specious these and the like propositions may at first sight seem yet when we come to press them and examine nicely what they contain we shall find that it all amounts to nothing but the signification of those terms a part of the definition predicated of any term secondly all propositions wherein a part of the complex idea which any term stands for is predicated of that term are only verbal vg to say that gold is a metal or heavy and thus all propositions wherein more comprehensive words called genera are affirmed of subordinate or less comprehensive called species or individuals are barely verbal when by these two rules we have examined the propositions that make up the discourses we ordinarily meet with both in and out of books we shall perhaps find that a greater part of them than is usually suspected are purely about the signification of words and contain nothing in them but the use and application of these signs this i think i may lay down for an infallible rule that wherever the distinct idea any word stands for is not known and considered and something not contained in the idea is not affirmed or denied of it there our thoughts stick wholly in sounds and are able to attain no real truth or falsehood this perhaps if well heeded might save us a great deal of useless amusement and dispute and very much shorten our trouble and wandering in the search of real and true knowledge of our threefold knowledge of existence general propositions that are certain concern not existence hitherto we have only considered the essences of things which being only abstract ideas and thereby removed in our thoughts from particular existence that being the proper operation of the mind in abstraction to consider an idea under no other existence but what it has in the understanding gives us no knowledge of real existence at all where by the way we may take notice that universal propositions of whose truth or falsehood we can have certain knowledge concern not existence and further that all particular affirmations or negations that would not be certain if they were made general are only concerning existence they declaring only the accidental union or separation of ideas in things existing which in their abstract natures have no known necessary union or repugnancy a threefold knowledge of existence but leaving the nature of propositions and different ways of predication to be considered more at large in another place let us proceed now to inquire concerning our knowledge of the existence of things and how we come by it i say then that we have the knowledge of our own existence by intuition of the existence of god by demonstration and of other things by sensation our knowledge of our own existence is intuitive as for our own existence we perceive it so plainly and so certainly that it neither needs nor is capable of any proof for nothing can be more evident to us than our own existence i think i reason i feel pleasure and pain can any of these be more evident to me than my own existence if i doubt of all other things that very doubt makes me perceive my own existence and will not suffer me to doubt of that for if i know i feel pain it is evident i have as certain perception of my own existence as of the existence of the pain i feel or if i know i doubt i have as certain perception of the existence of the thing doubting as of that thought which i call doubt experience then convinces us that we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and an internal infallible perception that we are in every act of sensation reasoning or thinking we are conscious to ourselves of our own being and in this matter come not short of the highest degree of certainty of our knowledge of the existence of a god we are capable of knowing certainly that there is a god though god has given us no innate ideas of himself though he has stamped no original characters on our minds wherein we may read his being yet having furnished us with those faculties our minds are endowed with he hath not left himself without witness since we have sense perception and reason and cannot want a clear proof of him as long as we carry ourselves about us nor can we justly complain of our ignorance in this great point since he has so plentifully provided us with the means to discover and know him so far as is necessary to the end of our being and the great concernment of our happiness but though this be the most obvious truth that reason discovers and though its evidence be if i mistake not equal to mathematical certainty yet it requires thought and attention and the mind must apply itself to a regular deduction of it from some part of our intuitive knowledge or else we shall be as uncertain and ignorant of this as of other propositions which are in themselves capable of clear demonstration to show therefore that we are capable of knowing ie being certain that there is a god and how we may come by this certainty i think we need go no further than ourselves and that undoubted knowledge we have of our own existence for man knows that he himself exists i think it is beyond question that man has a clear idea of his own being he knows certainly he exists and that he is something he that can doubt whether he be anything or no i speak not to no more than i would argue with pure nothing or endeavour to convince nonentity that it were something if any one pretends to be so sceptical as to deny his own existence for really to doubt of it is manifestly impossible let him for me enjoy his beloved happiness of being nothing until hunger or some other pain convince him of the contrary this then i think i may take for a truth which every ones certain knowledge assures him of beyond the liberty of doubting viz that he is something that actually exists he knows also that nothing cannot produce a being therefore something must have existed from eternity in the next place man knows by an intuitive certainty that bare nothing can no more produce any real being than it can be equal to two right angles if a man knows not that nonentity or the absence of all being cannot be equal to two right angles it is impossible he should know any demonstration in euclid if therefore we know there is some real being and that nonentity cannot produce any real being it is an evident demonstration that from eternity there has been something since what was not from eternity had a beginning and what had a beginning must be produced by something else and that eternal being must be most powerful next it is evident that what had its being and beginning from another must also have all that which is in and belongs to its being from another too all the powers it has must be owing to and received from the same source this eternal source then of all being must also be the source and original of all power and so this eternal being must be also the most powerful and most knowing again a man finds in himself perception and knowledge we have then got one step further and we are certain now that there is not only some being but some knowing intelligent being in the world there was a time then when there was no knowing being and when knowledge began to be or else there has been also a knowing being from eternity if it be said there was a time when no being had any knowledge when that eternal being was void of all understanding i reply that then it was impossible there should ever have been any knowledge it being as impossible that things wholly void of knowledge and operating blindly and without any perception should produce a knowing being as it is impossible that a triangle should make itself three angles bigger than two right ones for it is as repugnant to the idea of senseless matter that it should put into itself sense perception and knowledge as it is repugnant to the idea of a triangle that it should put into itself greater angles than two right ones and therefore god thus from the consideration of ourselves and what we infallibly find in our own constitutions our reason leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truththat there is an eternal most powerful and most knowing being which whether any one will please to call god it matters not the thing is evident and from this idea duly considered will easily be deduced all those other attributes which we ought to ascribe to this eternal being if nevertheless any one should be found so senselessly arrogant as to suppose man alone knowing and wise but yet the product of mere ignorance and chance and that all the rest of the universe acted only by that blind haphazard i shall leave with him that very rational and emphatical rebuke of tully i ii de leg to be considered at his leisure what can be more sillily arrogant and misbecoming than for a man to think that he has a mind and understanding in him but yet in all the universe beside there is no such thing or that those things which with the utmost stretch of his reason he can scarce comprehend should be moved and managed without any reason at all quid est enim verius quam neminem esse oportere tam stulte arrogantem ut in se mentem et rationem putet inesse in caelo mundoque non putet aut ea quae vix summa ingenii ratione comprehendat nulla ratione moveri putet from what has been said it is plain to me we have a more certain knowledge of the existence of a god than of anything our senses have not immediately discovered to us nay i presume i may say that we more certainly know that there is a god than that there is anything else without us when i say we know i mean there is such a knowledge within our reach which we cannot miss if we will but apply our minds to that as we do to several other inquiries our idea of a most perfect being not the sole proof of a god how far the idea of a most perfect being which a man may frame in his mind does or does not prove the existence of a god i will not here examine for in the different make of mens tempers and application of their thoughts some arguments prevail more on one and some on another for the confirmation of the same truth but yet i think this i may say that it is an ill way of establishing this truth and silencing atheists to lay the whole stress of so important a point as this upon that sole foundation and take some mens having that idea of god in their minds for it is evident some men have none and some worse than none and the most very different for the only proof of a deity and out of an over fondness of that darling invention cashier or at least endeavour to invalidate all other arguments and forbid us to hearken to those proofs as being weak or fallacious which our own existence and the sensible parts of the universe offer so clearly and cogently to our thoughts that i deem it impossible for a considering man to withstand them for i judge it as certain and clear a truth as can anywhere be delivered that the invisible things of god are clearly seen from the creation of the world being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead though our own being furnishes us as i have shown with an evident and incontestable proof of a deity and i believe nobody can avoid the cogency of it who will but as carefully attend to it as to any other demonstration of so many parts yet this being so fundamental a truth and of that consequence that all religion and genuine morality depend thereon i doubt not but i shall be forgiven by my reader if i go over some parts of this argument again and enlarge a little more upon them recapitulationsomething from eternity there is no truth more evident than that something must be from eternity i never yet heard of any one so unreasonable or that could suppose so manifest a contradiction as a time wherein there was perfectly nothing this being of all absurdities the greatest to imagine that pure nothing the perfect negation and absence of all beings should ever produce any real existence it being then unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude that something has existed from eternity let us next see what kind of thing that must be two sorts of beings cogitative and incogitative there are but two sorts of beings in the world that man knows or conceives first such as are purely material without sense perception or thought as the clippings of our beards and parings of our nails secondly sensible thinking perceiving beings such as we find ourselves to be which if you please we will hereafter call cogitative and incogitative beings which to our present purpose if for nothing else are perhaps better terms than material and immaterial incogitative being cannot produce a cogitative being if then there must be something eternal let us see what sort of being it must be and to that it is very obvious to reason that it must necessarily be a cogitative being for it is as impossible to conceive that ever bare incogitative matter should produce a thinking intelligent being as that nothing should of itself produce matter let us suppose any parcel of matter eternal great or small we shall find it in itself able to produce nothing for example let us suppose the matter of the next pebble we meet with eternal closely united and the parts firmly at rest together if there were no other being in the world must it not eternally remain so a dead inactive lump is it possible to conceive it can add motion to itself being purely matter or produce anything matter then by its own strength cannot produce in itself so much as motion the motion it has must also be from eternity or else be produced and added to matter by some other being more powerful than matter matter as is evident having not power to produce motion in itself but let us suppose motion eternal too yet matter incogitative matter and motion whatever changes it might produce of figure and bulk could never produce thought knowledge will still be as far beyond the power of motion and matter to produce as matter is beyond the power of nothing or nonentity to produce and i appeal to every ones own thoughts whether he cannot as easily conceive matter produced by nothing as thought to be produced by pure matter when before there was no such thing as thought or an intelligent being existing divide matter into as many parts as you will which we are apt to imagine a sort of spiritualizing or making a thinking thing of it vary the figure and motion of it as much as you pleasea globe cube cone prism cylinder c whose diameters are but th part of a gry will operate no otherwise upon other bodies of proportionable bulk than those of an inch or foot diameter and you may as rationally expect to produce sense thought and knowledge by putting together in a certain figure and motion gross particles of matter as by those that are the very minutest that do anywhere exist they knock impel and resist one another just as the greater do and that is all they can do so that if we will suppose nothing first or eternal matter can never begin to be if we suppose bare matter without motion eternal motion can never begin to be if we suppose only matter and motion first or eternal thought can never begin to be for it is impossible to conceive that matter either with or without motion could have originally in and from itself sense perception and knowledge as is evident from hence that then sense perception and knowledge must be a property eternally inseparable from matter and every particle of it not to add that though our general or specific conception of matter makes us speak of it as one thing yet really all matter is not one individual thing neither is there any such thing existing as one material being or one single body that we know or can conceive and therefore if matter were the eternal first cogitative being there would not be one eternal infinite cogitative being but an infinite number of eternal finite cogitative beings independent one of another of limited force and distinct thoughts which could never produce that order harmony and beauty which are to be found in nature since therefore whatsoever is the first eternal being must necessarily be cogitative and whatsoever is first of all things must necessarily contain in it and actually have at least all the perfections that can ever after exist nor can it ever give to another any perfection that it hath not either actually in itself or at least in a higher degree it necessarily follows that the first eternal being cannot be matter therefore there has been an eternal cogitative being if therefore it be evident that something necessarily must exist from eternity it is also as evident that that something must necessarily be a cogitative being for it is as impossible that incogitative matter should produce a cogitative being as that nothing or the negation of all being should produce a positive being or matter the attributes of the eternal cogitative being though this discovery of the necessary existence of an eternal mind does sufficiently lead us into the knowledge of god since it will hence follow that all other knowing beings that have a beginning must depend on him and have no other ways of knowledge or extent of power than what he gives them and therefore if he made those he made also the less excellent pieces of this universeall inanimate beings whereby his omniscience power and providence will be established and all his other attributes necessarily follow yet to clear up this a little further we will see what doubts can be raised against it whether the eternal mind may he also material or no first perhaps it will be said that though it be as clear as demonstration can make it that there must be an eternal being and that being must also be knowing yet it does not follow but that thinking being may also be material let it be so it equally still follows that there is a god for if there be an eternal omniscient omnipotent being it is certain that there is a god whether you imagine that being to be material or no but herein i suppose lies the danger and deceit of that suppositionthere being no way to avoid the demonstration that there is an eternal knowing being men devoted to matter would willingly have it granted that this knowing being is material and then letting slide out of their minds or the discourse the demonstration whereby an eternal knowing being was proved necessarily to exist would argue all to be matter and so deny a god that is an eternal cogitative being whereby they are so far from establishing that they destroy their own hypothesis for if there can be in their opinion eternal matter without any eternal cogitative being they manifestly separate matter and thinking and suppose no necessary connexion of the one with the other and so establish the necessity of an eternal spirit but not of matter since it has been proved already that an eternal cogitative being is unavoidably to be granted now if thinking and matter may be separated the eternal existence of matter will not follow from the eternal existence of a cogitative being and they suppose it to no purpose not material first because each particle of matter is not cogitative but now let us see how they can satisfy themselves or others that this eternal thinking being is material i i would ask them whether they imagine that all matter every particle of matter thinks this i suppose they will scarce say since then there would be as many eternal thinking beings as there are particles of matter and so an infinity of gods and yet if they will not allow matter as matter that is every particle of matter to be as well cogitative as extended they will have as hard a task to make out to their own reasons a cogitative being out of incogitative particles as an extended being out of unextended parts if i may so speak ii secondly because one particle alone of matter cannot be cogitative if all matter does not think i next ask whether it be only one atom that does so this has as many absurdities as the other for then this atom of matter must be alone eternal or not if this alone be eternal then this alone by its powerful thought or will made all the rest of matter and so we have the creation of matter by a powerful thought which is that the materialists stick at for if they suppose one single thinking atom to have produced all the rest of matter they cannot ascribe that preeminency to it upon any other account than that of its thinking the only supposed difference but allow it to be by some other way which is above our conception it must still be creation and these men must give up their great maxim ex nihilo nil fit if it be said that all the rest of matter is equally eternal as that thinking atom it will be to say anything at pleasure though ever so absurd for to suppose all matter eternal and yet one small particle in knowledge and power infinitely above all the rest is without any the least appearance of reason to frame an hypothesis every particle of matter as matter is capable of all the same figures and motions of any other and i challenge any one in his thoughts to add anything else to one above another iii thirdly because a system of incogitative matter cannot be cogitative if then neither one peculiar atom alone can be this eternal thinking being nor all matter as matter ie every particle of matter can be it it only remains that it is some certain system of matter duly put together that is this thinking eternal being this is that which i imagine is that notion which men are aptest to have of god who would have him a material being as most readily suggested to them by the ordinary conceit they have of themselves and other men which they take to be material thinking beings but this imagination however more natural is no less absurd than the other for to suppose the eternal think ing being to be nothing else but a composition of particles of matter each whereof is incogitative is to ascribe all the wisdom and knowledge of that eternal being only to the juxtaposition of parts than which nothing can be more absurd for unthinking particles of matter however put together can have nothing thereby added to them but a new relation of position which it is impossible should give thought and knowledge to them and that whether this corporeal system is in motion or at rest but further this corporeal system either has all its parts at rest or it is a certain motion of the parts wherein its thinking consists if it be perfectly at rest it is but one lump and so can have no privileges above one atom if it be the motion of its parts on which its thinking depends all the thoughts there must be unavoidably accidental and limited since all the particles that by motion cause thought being each of them in itself without any thought cannot regulate its own motions much less be regulated by the thought of the whole since that thought is not the cause of motion for then it must be antecedent to it and so without it but the consequence of it whereby freedom power choice and all rational and wise thinking or acting will be quite taken away so that such a thinking being will be no better nor wiser than pure blind matter since to resolve all into the accidental unguided motions of blind matter or into thought depending on unguided motions of blind matter is the same thing not to mention the narrowness of such thoughts and knowledge that must depend on the motion of such parts but there needs no enumeration of any more absurdities and impossibilities in this hypothesis however full of them it be than that before mentioned since let this thinking system be all or a part of the matter of the universe it is impossible that any one particle should either know its own or the motion of any other particle or the whole know the motion of every particle and so regulate its own thoughts or motions or indeed have any thought resulting from such motion matter not coeternal with an eternal mind secondly others would have matter to be eternal not withstanding that they allow an eternal cogitative immaterial being this though it take not away the being of a god yet since it denies one and the first great piece of his workmanship the creation let us consider it a little matter must be allowed eternal why because you cannot conceive how it can be made out of nothing why do you not also think yourself eternal you will answer perhaps because about twenty or forty years since you began to be but if i ask you what that you is which began then to be you can scarce tell me the matter whereof you are made began not then to be for if it did then it is not eternal but it began to be put together in such a fashion and frame as makes up your body but yet that frame of particles is not you it makes not that thinking thing you are for i have now to do with one who allows an eternal immaterial thinking being but would have unthinking matter eternal too therefore when did that thinking thing begin to be if it did never begin to be then have you always been a thinking thing from eternity the absurdity whereof i need not confute till i meet with one who is so void of understanding as to own it if therefore you can allow a thinking thing to be made out of nothing as all things that are not eternal must be why also can you not allow it possible for a material being to be made out of nothing by an equal power but that you have the experience of the one in view and not of the other though when well considered creation of a spirit will be found to require no less power than the creation of matter nay possibly if we would emancipate ourselves from vulgar notions and raise our thoughts as far as they would reach to a closer contemplation of things we might be able to aim at some dim and seeming conception how matter might at first be made and begin to exist by the power of that eternal first being but to give beginning and being to a spirit would be found a more inconceivable effect of omnipotent power but this being what would perhaps lead us too far from the notions on which the philosophy now in the world is built it would not be pardonable to deviate so far from them or to inquire so far as grammar itself would authorize if the common settled opinion opposes it especially in this place where the received doctrine serves well enough to our present purpose and leaves this past doubt that the creation or beginning of any one substance out of nothing being once admitted the creation of all other but the creator himself may with the same ease be supposed objection creation out of nothing but you will say is it not impossible to admit of the making anything out of nothing since we cannot possibly conceive it i answer no because it is not reasonable to deny the power of an infinite being because we cannot comprehend its operations we do not deny other effects upon this ground because we cannot possibly conceive the manner of their production we cannot conceive how anything but impulse of body can move body and yet that is not a reason sufficient to make us deny it possible against the constant experience we have of it in ourselves in all our voluntary motions which are produced in us only by the free action or thought of our own minds and are not nor can be the effects of the impulse or determination of the motion of blind matter in or upon our own bodies for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter it for example my right hand writes whilst my left hand is still what causes rest in one and motion in the other nothing but my willa thought of my mind my thought only changing the right hand rests and the left hand moves this is matter of fact which cannot be denied explain this and make it intelligible and then the next step will be to understand creation for the giving a new determination to the motion of the animal spirits which some make use of to explain voluntary motion clears not the difficulty one jot to alter the determination of motion being in this case no easier nor less than to give motion itself since the new determination given to the animal spirits must be either immediately by thought or by some other body put in their way by thought which was not in their way before and so must owe its motion to thought either of which leaves voluntary motion as unintelligible as it was before in the meantime it is an overvaluing ourselves to reduce all to the narrow measure of our capacities and to conclude all things impos sible to be done whose manner of doing exceeds our comprehension this is to make our comprehension infinite or god finite when what he can do is limited to what we can conceive of it if you do not understand the operations of your own finite mind that thinking thing within you do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that eternal infinite mind who made and governs all things and whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain of our knowledge of the existence of other things knowledge of the existence of other finite beings is to be had only by actual sensation the knowledge of our own being we have by intuition the existence of a god reason clearly makes known to us as has been shown the knowledge of the existence of any other thing we can have only by sensation for there being no necessary connexion of real existence with any idea a man hath in his memory nor of any other existence but that of god with the existence of any particular man no particular man can know the existence of any other being but only when by actual operating upon him it makes itself perceived by him for the having the idea of anything in our mind no more proves the existence of that thing than the picture of a man evidences his being in the world or the visions of a dream make thereby a true history instance whiteness of this paper it is therefore the actual receiving of ideas from without that gives us notice of the existence of other things and makes us know that something doth exist at that time without us which causes that idea in us though perhaps we neither know nor consider how it does it for it takes not from the certainty of our senses and the ideas we receive by them that we know not the manner wherein they are produced vg whilst i write this i have by the paper affecting my eyes that idea produced in my mind which whatever object causes i call white by which i know that that quality or accident ie whose appearance before my eyes always causes that idea doth really exist and hath a being without me and of this the greatest assurance i can possibly have and to which my faculties can attain is the testimony of my eyes which are the proper and sole judges of this thing whose testimony i have reason to rely on as so certain that i can no more doubt whilst i write this that i see white and black and that something really exists that causes that sensation in me than that i write or move my hand which is a certainty as great as human nature is capable of concerning the existence of anything but a mans self alone and of god this notice by our senses though not so certain as demonstration yet may be called knowledge and proves the existence of things without us the notice we have by our senses of the existing of things without us though it be not altogether so certain as our intuitive knowledge or the deductions of our reason employed about the clear abstract ideas of our own minds yet it is an assurance that deserves the name of knowledge if we persuade ourselves that our faculties act and inform us right concerning the existence of those objects that affect them it cannot pass for an illgrounded confidence for i think nobody can in earnest be so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those things which he sees and feels at least he that can doubt so far whatever he may have with his own thoughts will never have any controversy with me since he can never be sure i say anything contrary to his own opinion as to myself i think god has given me assurance enough of the existence of things without me since by their different application i can produce in myself both pleasure and pain which is one great concernment of my present state this is certain the confidence that our faculties do not herein deceive us is the greatest assurance we are capable of concerning the existence of material beings for we cannot act anything but by our faculties nor talk of knowledge itself but by the help of those faculties which are fitted to apprehend even what knowledge is but besides the assurance we have from our senses themselves that they do not err in the information they give us of the existence of things without us when they are affected by them we are further confirmed in this assurance by other concurrent reasons i confirmed by concurrent reasonsfirst because we cannot have ideas of sensation but by the inlet of the senses it is plain those perceptions are produced in us by exterior causes affecting our senses because those that want the organs of any sense never can have the ideas belonging to that sense produced in their minds this is too evident to be doubted and therefore we cannot but be assured that they come in by the organs of that sense and no other way the organs themselves it is plain do not produce them for then the eyes of a man in the dark would produce colours and his nose smell roses in the winter but we see nobody gets the relish of a pineapple till he goes to the indies where it is and tastes it ii secondly because we find that an idea from actual sensation and another from memory are very distinct perceptions because sometimes i find that i cannot avoid the having those ideas produced in my mind for though when my eyes are shut or windows fast i can at pleasure recall to my mind the ideas of light or the sun which former sensations had lodged in my memory so i can at pleasure lay by that idea and take into my view that of the smell of a rose or taste of sugar but if i turn my eyes at noon towards the sun i cannot avoid the ideas which the light or sun then produces in me so that there is a manifest difference between the ideas laid up in my memory over which if they were there only i should have constantly the same power to dispose of them and lay them by at pleasure and those which force themselves upon me and i cannot avoid having and therefore it must needs be some exterior cause and the brisk acting of some objects without me whose efficacy i cannot resist that produces those ideas in my mind whether i will or no besides there is nobody who doth not perceive the difference in himself between contemplating the sun as he hath the idea of it in his memory and actually looking upon it of which two his perception is so distinct that few of his ideas are more distinguishable one from another and therefore he hath certain knowledge that they are not both memory or the actions of his mind and fancies only within him but that actual seeing hath a cause without iii thirdly because pleasure or pain which accompanies actual sensation accompanies not the returning of those ideas without the external objects add to this that many of those ideas are produced in us with pain which afterwards we remember without the least offence thus the pain of heat or cold when the idea of it is revived in our minds gives us no disturbance which when felt was very troublesome and is again when actually repeated which is occasioned by the disorder the external object causes in our bodies when applied to them and we remember the pains of hunger thirst or the headache without any pain at all which would either never disturb us or else constantly do it as often as we thought of it were there nothing more but ideas floating in our minds and appearances entertaining our fancies without the real existence of things affecting us from abroad the same may be said of pleasure accompanying several actual sensations and though mathematical demonstration depends not upon sense yet the examining them by diagrams gives great credit to the evidence of our sight and seems to give it a certainty approaching to that of demonstration itself for it would be very strange that a man should allow it for an undeniable truth that two angles of a figure which he measures by lines and angles of a diagram should be bigger one than the other and yet doubt of the existence of those lines and angles which by looking on he makes use of to measure that by iv fourthly because our senses assist one anothers testimony of the existence of outward things and enable us to predict our senses in many cases bear witness to the truth of each others report concerning the existence of sensible things without us he that sees a fire may if he doubt whether it be anything more than a bare fancy feel it too and be convinced by putting his hand in it which certainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or phantom unless that the pain be a fancy too which yet he cannot when the burn is well by raising the idea of it bring upon himself again thus i see whilst i write this i can change the appearance of the paper and by designing the letters tell beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment by barely drawing my pen over it which will neither appear let me fancy as much as i will if my hands stand still or though i move my pen if my eyes be shut nor when those characters are once made on the paper can i choose afterwards but see them as they are that is have the ideas of such letters as i have made whence it is manifest that they are not barely the sport and play of my own imagination when i find that the characters that were made at the pleasure of my own thoughts do not obey them nor yet cease to be whenever i shall fancy it but continue to affect my senses constantly and regularly according to the figures i made them to which if we will add that the sight of those shall from another man draw such sounds as i beforehand design they shall stand for there will be little reason left to doubt that those words i write do really exist without me when they cause a long series of regular sounds to affect my ears which could not be the effect of my imagination nor could my memory retain them in that order this certainty is as great as our condition needs but yet if after all this any one will be so sceptical as to distrust his senses and to affirm that all we see and hear feel and taste think and do during our whole being is but the series and deluding appearances of a long dream whereof there is no reality and therefore will question the existence of all things or our knowledge of anything i must desire him to consider that if all be a dream then he doth but dream that he makes the question and so it is not much matter that a waking man should answer him but yet if he pleases he may dream that i make him this answer that the certainty of things existing in rerum natura when we have the testimony of our senses for it is not only as great as our frame can attain to but as our condition needs for our faculties being suited not to the full extent of being nor to a perfect clear comprehensive knowledge of things free from all doubt and scruple but to the preservation of us in whom they are and accommodated to the use of life they serve to our purpose wen enough if they will but give us certain notice of those things which are convenient or inconvenient to us for he that sees a candle burning and hath experimented the force of its flame by putting his finger in it will little doubt that this is something existing without him which does him harm and puts him to great pain which is assurance enough when no man requires greater certainty to govern his actions by than what is as certain as his actions themselves and if our dreamer pleases to try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy mans fancy by putting his hand into it he may perhaps be wakened into a certainty greater than he could wish that it is something more than bare imagination so that this evidence is as great as we can desire being as certain to us as our pleasure or pain ie happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment either of knowing or being such an assurance of the existence of things without us is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and avoiding the evil which is caused by them which is the important concernment we have of being made acquainted with them but reaches no further than actual sensation in fine then when our senses do actually convey into our understandings any idea we cannot but be satisfied that there doth something at that time really exist without us which doth affect our senses and by them give notice of itself to our apprehensive faculties and actually produce that idea which we then perceive and we cannot so far distrust their testimony as to doubt that such collections of simple ideas as we have observed by our senses to be united together do really exist together but this knowledge extends as far as the present testimony of our senses employed about particular objects that do then affect them and no further for if i saw such a collection of simple ideas as is wont to be called man existing together one minute since and am now alone i cannot be certain that the same man exists now since there is no necessary connexion of his exist ence a minute since with his existence now by a thousand ways he may cease to be since i had the testimony of my senses for his existence and if i cannot be certain that the man i saw last today is now in being i can less be certain that he is so who hath been longer removed from my senses and i have not seen since yesterday or since the last year and much less can i be certain of the existence of men that i never saw and therefore though it be highly probable that millions of men do now exist yet whilst i am alone writing this i have not that certainty of it which we strictly call knowledge though the great likelihood of it puts me past doubt and it be reasonable for me to do several things upon the confidence that there are men and men also of my acquaintance with whom i have to do now in the world but this is but probability not knowledge folly to expect demonstration in everything whereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it is for a man of a narrow knowledge who having reason given him to judge of the different evidence and probability of things and to be swayed accordingly how vain i say it is to expect demonstration and certainty in things not capable of it and refuse assent to very rational propositions and act contrary to very plain and clear truths because they cannot be made out so evident as to surmount every the least i will not say reason but pretence of doubting he that in the ordinary affairs of life would admit of nothing but direct plain demonstration would be sure of nothing in this world but of perishing quickly the wholesomeness of his meat or drink would not give him reason to venture on it and i would fain know what it is he could do upon such grounds as are capable of no doubt no objection past existence of other things is known by memory as when our senses are actually employed about any object we do know that it does exist so by our memory we may be assured that heretofore things that affected our senses have existed and thus we have knowledge of the past existence of several things whereof our senses having informed us our memories still retain the ideas and of this we are past all doubt so long as we remember well but this knowledge also reaches no further than our senses have formerly assured us thus seeing water at this instant it is an unquestionable truth to me that water doth exist and remembering that i saw it yesterday it will also be always true and as long as my memory retains it always an undoubted proposition to me that water did exist the th of july as it will also be equally true that a certain number of very fine colours did exist which at the same time i saw upon a bubble of that water but being now quite out of sight both of the water and bubbles too it is no more certainly known to me that the water doth now exist than that the bubbles or colours therein do so it being no more necessary that water should exist today because it existed yesterday than that the colours or bubbles exist today because they existed yesterday though it be exceedingly much more probable because water hath been observed to continue long in existence but bubbles and the colours on them quickly cease to be the existence of other finite spirits not knowable and rests on faith what ideas we have of spirits and how we come by them i have already shown but though we have those ideas in our minds and know we have them there the having the ideas of spirits does not make us know that any such things do exist without us or that there are any finite spirits or any other spiritual beings but the eternal god we have ground from revelation and several other reasons to believe with assurance that there are such creatures but our senses not being able to discover them we want the means of knowing their particular existences for we can no more know that there are finite spirits really existing by the idea we have of such beings in our minds than by the ideas any one has of fairies or centaurs he can come to know that things answering those ideas do really exist and therefore concerning the existence of finite spirits as well as several other things we must content ourselves with the evidence of faith but universal certain propositions concerning this matter are beyond our reach for however true it may be vg that all the intelligent spirits that god ever created do still exist yet it can never make a part of our certain knowledge these and the like propositions we may assent to as highly probable but are not i fear in this state capable of knowing we are not then to put others upon demonstrating nor ourselves upon search of universal certainty in all those matters wherein we are not capable of any other knowledge but what our senses give us in this or that particular only particular propositions concerning concrete existences are knowable by which it appears that there are two sorts of propositions there is one sort of propositions concerning the existence of anything answerable to such an idea as having the idea of an elephant phoenix motion or an angel in my mind the first and natural inquiry is whether such a thing does anywhere exist and this knowledge is only of particulars no existence of anything without us but only of god can certainly be known further than our senses inform us there is another sort of propositions wherein is expressed the agreement or disagreement of our abstract ideas and their dependence on one another such propositions may be universal and certain so having the idea of god and myself of fear and obedience i cannot but be sure that god is to be feared and obeyed by me and this proposition will be certain concerning man in general if i have made an abstract idea of such a species whereof i am one particular but yet this proposition how certain soever that men ought to fear and obey god proves not to me the existence of men in the world but will be true of all such creatures whenever they do exist which certainty of such general propositions depends on the agreement or disagreement to be discovered in those abstract ideas and all general propositions that are known to be true concern abstract ideas in the former case our knowledge is the consequence of the existence of things producing ideas in our minds by our senses in the latter knowledge is the consequence of the ideas be they what they will that are in our minds producing there general certain propositions many of these are called aeternae veritates and all of them indeed are so not from being written all or any of them in the minds of all men or that they were any of them propositions in any ones mind till he having got the abstract ideas joined or separated them by affirmation or negation but wheresoever we can suppose such a creature as man is endowed with such faculties and thereby furnished with such ideas as we have we must conclude he must needs when he applies his thoughts to the consideration of his ideas know the truth of certain propositions that will arise from the agreement or disagreement which he will perceive in his own ideas such propositions are therefore called eternal truths not because they are eternal propositions actually formed and antecedent to the understanding that at any time makes them nor because they are imprinted on the mind from any patterns that are anywhere out of the mind and existed before but because being once made about abstract ideas so as to be true they will whenever they can be supposed to be made again at any time past or to come by a mind having those ideas always actually be true for names being supposed to stand perpetually for the same ideas and the same ideas having immutably the same habitudes one to another propositions concerning any abstract ideas that are once true must needs be eternal verities of the improvement of our knowledge knowledge is not got from maxims it having been the common received opinion amongst men of letters that maxims were the foundation of all knowledge and that the sciences were each of them built upon certain praecognita from whence the understanding was to take its rise and by which it was to conduct itself in its inquiries into the matters belonging to that science the beaten road of the schools has been to lay down in the beginning one or more general propositions as foundations whereon to build the knowledge that was to be had of that subject these doctrines thus laid down for foundations of any science were called principles as the beginnings from which we must set out and look no further backwards in our inquiries as we have already observed the occasion of that opinion one thing which might probably give an occasion to this way of proceeding in other sciences was as i suppose the good suc cess it seemed to have in mathematics wherein men being observed to attain a great certainty of knowledge these sciences came by preeminence to be called mathemata and mathesis learning or things learned thoroughly learned as having of all others the greatest certainty clearness and evidence in them but from comparing clear and distinct ideas but if any one will consider he will i guess find that the great advancement and certainty of real knowledge which men arrived to in these sciences was not owing to the influence of these principles nor derived from any peculiar advantage they received from two or three general maxims laid down in the beginning but from the clear distinct complete ideas their thoughts were employed about and the relation of equality and excess so clear between some of them that they had an intuitive knowledge and by that a way to discover it in others and this without the help of those maxims for i ask is it not possible for a young lad to know that his whole body is bigger than his little finger but by virtue of this axiom that the whole is bigger than a part nor be assured of it till he has learned that maxim or cannot a country wench know that having received a shilling from one that owes her three and a shilling also from another that owes her three the remaining debts in each of their hands are equal cannot she know this i say unless she fetch the certainty of it from this maxim that if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equals a maxim which possibly she never heard or thought of i desire any one to consider from what has been elsewhere said which is known first and clearest by most people the particular instance or the general rule and which it is that gives life and birth to the other these general rules are but the comparing our more general and abstract ideas which are the workmanship of the mind made and names given to them for the easier dispatch in its reasonings and drawing into comprehensive terms and short rules its various and multiplied observations but knowledge began in the mind and was founded on particulars though afterwards perhaps no notice was taken thereof it being natural for the mind forward still to enlarge its knowl edge most attentively to lay up those general notions and make the proper use of them which is to disburden the memory of the cumbersome load of particulars for i desire it may be considered what more certainty there is to a child or any one that his body little finger and all is bigger than his little finger alone after you have given to his body the name whole and to his little finger the name part than he could have had before or what new knowledge concerning his body can these two relative terms give him which he could not have without them could he not know that his body was bigger than his little finger if his language were yet so imperfect that he had no such relative terms as whole and part i ask further when he has got these names how is he more certain that his body is a whole and his little finger a part than he was or might be certain before he learnt those terms that his body was bigger than his little finger any one may as reasonably doubt or deny that his little finger is a part of his body as that it is less than his body and he that can doubt whether it be less will as certainly doubt whether it be a part so that the maxim the whole is bigger than a part can never be made use of to prove the little finger less than the body but when it is useless by being brought to convince one of a truth which he knows already for he that does not certainly know that any parcel of matter with another parcel of matter joined to it is bigger than either of them alone will never be able to know it by the help of these two relative terms whole and part make of them what maxim you please dangerous to build upon precarious principles but be it in the mathematics as it will whether it be clearer that taking an inch from a black line of two inches and an inch from a red line of two inches the remaining parts of the two lines will be equal or that if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equals which i say of these two is the clearer and first known i leave to any one to determine it not being material to my present occasion that which i have here to do is to inquire whether if it be the readiest way to knowledge to begin with general maxims and build upon them it be yet a safe way to take the principles which are laid down in any other science as unquestionable truths and so receive them without examination and adhere to them without suffering them to be doubted of because mathematicians have been so happy or so fair to use none but selfevident and undeniable if this be so i know not what may not pass for truth in morality what may not be introduced and proved in natural philosophy let that principle of some of the old philosophers that all is matter and that there is nothing else be received for certain and indubitable and it will be easy to be seen by the writings of some that have revived it again in our days what consequences it will lead us into let any one with polemo take the world or with the stoics the aether or the sun or with anaximenes the air to be god and what a divinity religion and worship must we needs have nothing can be so dangerous as principles thus taken up without questioning or examination especially if they be such as concern morality which influence mens lives and give a bias to all their actions who might not justly expect another kind of life in aristippus who placed happiness in bodily pleasure and in antisthenes who made virtue sufficient to felicity and he who with plato shall place beatitude in the knowledge of god will have his thoughts raised to other contemplations than those who look not beyond this spot of earth and those perishing things which are to be had in it he that with archelaus shall lay it down as a principle that right and wrong honest and dishonest are defined only by laws and not by nature will have other measures of moral rectitude and pravity than those who take it for granted that we are under obligations antecedent to all human constitutions to do so is no certain way to truth if therefore those that pass for principles are not certain which we must have some way to know that we may be able to distinguish them from those that are doubtful but are only made so to us by our blind assent we are liable to be misled by them and instead of being guided into truth we shall by principles be only confirmed in mistake and error but to compare clear complete ideas under steady names but since the knowledge of the certainty of prin ciples as well as of all other truths depends only upon the perception we have of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas the way to improve our knowledge is not i am sure blindly and with an implicit faith to receive and swallow principles but is i think to get and fix in our minds clear distinct and complete ideas as far as they are to be had and annex to them proper and constant names and thus perhaps without any other principles but barely considering those perfect ideas and by comparing them one with another finding their agreement and disagreement and their several relations and habitudes we shall get more true and clear knowledge by the conduct of this one rule than by taking up principles and thereby putting our minds into the disposal of others the true method of advancing knowledge is by considering our abstract ideas we must therefore if we will proceed as reason advises adapt our methods of inquiry to the nature of the ideas we examine and the truth we search after general and certain truths are only founded in the habitudes and relations of abstract ideas a sagacious and methodical application of our thoughts for the finding out these relations is the only way to discover all that can be put with truth and certainty concerning them into general propositions by what steps we are to proceed in these is to be learned in the schools of the mathematicians who from very plain and easy beginnings by gentle degrees and a continued chain of reasonings proceed to the discovery and demonstration of truths that appear at first sight beyond human capacity the art of finding proofs and the admirable methods they have invented for the singling out and laying in order those intermediate ideas that demonstratively show the equality or inequality of unapplicable quantities is that which has carried them so far and produced such wonderful and unexpected discoveries but whether something like this in respect of other ideas as well as those of magnitude may not in time be found out i will not determine this i think i may say that if other ideas that are the real as well as nominal essences of their species were pursued in the way familiar to mathematicians they would carry our thoughts further and with greater evidence and clearness than possibly we are apt to imagine by which morality also may he made clearer this gave me the confidence to advance that conjecture which i suggest chap iii viz that morality is capable of demonstration as well as mathematics for the ideas that ethics are conversant about being all real essences and such as i imagine have a discoverable connexion and agreement one with another so far as we can find their habitudes and relations so far we shall be possessed of certain real and general truths and i doubt not but if a right method were taken a great part of morality might be made out with that clearness that could leave to a considering man no more reason to doubt than he could have to doubt of the truth of propositions in mathematics which have been demonstrated to him our knowledge of substances is to be improved not by contemplation of abstract ideas but only by experience in our search after the knowledge of substances our want of ideas that are suitable to such a way of proceeding obliges us to a quite different method we advance not here as in the other where our abstract ideas are real as well as nominal essences by contemplating our ideas and considering their relations and correspondences that helps us very little for the reasons that in another place we have at large set down by which i think it is evident that substances afford matter of very little general knowledge and the bare contemplation of their abstract ideas will carry us but a very little way in the search of truth and certainty what then are we to do for the improvement of our knowledge in substantial beings here we are to take a quite contrary course the want of ideas of their real essences sends us from our own thoughts to the things themselves as they exist experience here must teach me what reason cannot and it is by trying alone that i can certainly know what other qualities coexist with those of my complex idea vg whether that yellow heavy fusible body i call gold be malleable or no which experience which way ever it prove in that particular body i examine makes me not certain that it is so in all or any other yellow heavy fusible bodies but that which i have tried because it is no consequence one way or the other from my complex idea the necessity or inconsistence of malleability hath no visible connexion with the combination of that colour weight and fusibility in any body what i have said here of the nominal essence of gold supposed to consist of a body of such a determinate colour weight and fusibility will hold true if malleableness fixedness and solubility in aqua regia be added to it our reasonings from these ideas will carry us but a little way in the certain discovery of the other properties in those masses of matter wherein all these are to be found because the other properties of such bodies depending not on these but on that unknown real essence on which these also depend we cannot by them discover the rest we can go no further than the simple ideas of our nominal essence will carry us which is very little beyond themselves and so afford us but very sparingly any certain universal and useful truths for upon trial having found that particular piece and all others of that colour weight and fusibility that i ever tried malleable that also makes now perhaps a part of my complex idea part of my nominal essence of gold whereby though i make my complex idea to which i affix the name gold to consist of more simple ideas than before yet still it not containing the real essence of any species of bodies it helps me not certainly to know i say to know perhaps it may be to conjecture the other remaining properties of that body further than they have a visible connexion with some or all of the simple ideas that make up my nominal essence for example i cannot be certain from this complex idea whether gold be fixed or no because as before there is no necessary connexion or inconsistence to be discovered betwixt a complex idea of a body yellow heavy fusible malleable betwixt these i say and fixedness so that i may certainly know that in whatsoever body these are found there fixedness is sure to be here again for assurance i must apply myself to experience as far as that reaches i may have certain knowledge but no further experience may procure us convenience not science i deny not but a man accustomed to rational and regular experiments shall be able to see further into the nature of bodies and guess righter at their yet unknown properties than one that is a stranger to them but yet as i have said this is but judgment and opinion not knowledge and certainty this way of getting and improving our knowledge in substances only by experience and history which is all that the weakness of our faculties in this state of mediocrity which we are in in this world can attain to makes me suspect that natural philosophy is not capable of being made a science we are able i imagine to reach very little general knowledge concerning the species of bodies and their several properties experiments and historical observations we may have from which we may draw advantages of ease and health and thereby increase our stock of conveniences for this life but beyond this i fear our talents reach not nor are our faculties as i guess able to advance we are fitted for moral science but only for probable interpretations of external nature from whence it is obvious to conclude that since our faculties are not fitted to penetrate into the internal fabric and real essences of bodies but yet plainly discover to us the being of a god and the knowledge of ourselves enough to lead us into a full and clear discovery of our duty and great concernment it will become us as rational creatures to employ those faculties we have about what they are most adapted to and follow the direction of nature where it seems to point us out the way for it is rational to conclude that our proper employment lies in those inquiries and in that sort of knowledge which is most suited to our natural capacities and carries in it our greatest interest ie the condition of our eternal estate hence i think i may conclude that morality is the proper science and business of mankind in general who are both concerned and fitted to search out their summum bonum as several arts conversant about several parts of nature are the lot and private talent of particular men for the common use of human life and their own particular subsistence in this world of what consequence the discovery of one natural body and its properties may be to human life the whole great continent of america is a convincing instance whose igno rance in useful arts and want of the greatest part of the conveniences of life in a country that abounded with all sorts of natural plenty i think may be attributed to their ignorance of what was to be found in a very ordinary despicable stone i mean the mineral of iron and whatever we think of our parts or improvements in this part of the world where knowledge and plenty seem to vie with each other yet to any one that will seriously reflect on it i suppose it will appear past doubt that were the use of iron lost among us we should in a few ages be unavoidably reduced to the wants and ignorance of the ancient savage americans whose natural endowments and provisions come no way short of those of the most flourishing and polite nations so that he who first made known the use of that contemptible mineral may be truly styled the father of arts and author of plenty in the study of nature we must beware of hypotheses and wrong principles i would not therefore be thought to disesteem or dissuade the study of nature i readily agree the contemplation of his works gives us occasion to admire revere and glorify their author and if rightly directed may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary charity that have at so great charge been raised by the founders of hospitals and almshouses he that first invented printing discovered the use of the compass or made public the virture and right use of kin kina did more for the propagation of knowledge for the supply and increase of useful commodities and saved more from the grave than those who built colleges workhouses and hospitals all that i would say is that we should not be too forwardly possessed with the opinion or expectation of knowledge where it is not to be had or by ways that will not attain to it that we should not take doubtful systems for complete sciences nor unintelligible notions for scientifical demonstrations in the knowledge of bodies we must be content to glean what we can from particular experiments since we cannot from a discovery of their real essences grasp at a time whole sheaves and in bundles comprehend the nature and properties of whole species together where our inquiry is con cerning coexistence or repugnancy to coexist which by contemplation of our ideas we cannot discover there experience observation and natural history must give us by our senses and by retail an insight into corporeal substances the knowledge of bodies we must get by our senses warily employed in taking notice of their qualities and operations on one another and what we hope to know of separate spirits in this world we must i think expect only from revelation he that shall consider how little general maxims precarious principles and hypotheses laid down at pleasure have promoted true knowledge or helped to satisfy the inquiries of rational men after real improvements how little i say the setting out at that end has for many ages together advanced mens progress towards the knowledge of natural philosophy will think we have reason to thank those who in this latter age have taken another course and have trod out to us though not an easier way to learned ignorance yet a surer way to profitable knowledge the true use of hypotheses not that we may not to explain any phenomena of nature make use of any probable hypotheses whatsoever hypotheses if they are well made are at least great helps to the memory and often direct us to new discoveries but my meaning is that we should not take up any one too hastily which the mind that would always penetrate into the causes of things and have principles to rest on is very apt to do till we have very well examined particulars and made several experiments in that thing which we would explain by our hypothesis and see whether it will agree to them all whether our principles will carry us quite through and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature as they seem to accommodate and explain another and at least that we take care that the name of principles deceive us not nor impose on us by making us receive that for an unquestionable truth which is really at best but a very doubtful conjecture such as are most i had almost said all of the hypotheses in natural philosophy clear and distinct ideas with settled names and the finding of those intermediate ideas which show their agreement or disagreement are the ways to enlarge our knowledge but whether natural philosophy be capable of certainty or no the ways to enlarge our knowledge as far as we are capable seem to me in short to be these two first the first is to get and settle in our minds determined ideas of those things whereof we have general or specific names at least so many of them as we would consider and improve our knowledge in or reason about and if they be specific ideas of substances we should endeavour also to make them as complete as we can whereby i mean that we should put together as many simple ideas as being constantly observed to coexist may perfectly determine the species and each of those simple ideas which are the ingredients of our complex ones should be clear and distinct in our minds for it being evident that our knowledge cannot exceed our ideas as far as they are either imperfect confused or obscure we cannot expect to have certain perfect or clear knowledge secondly the other is the art of finding out those intermediate ideas which may show us the agreement or repugnancy of other ideas which cannot be immediately compared mathematics an instance of this that these two and not the relying on maxims and drawing consequences from some general propositions are the right methods of improving our knowledge in the ideas of other modes besides those of quantity the consideration of mathematical knowledge will easily inform us where first we shall find that he that has not a perfect and clear idea of those angles or figures of which he desires to know anything is utterly thereby incapable of any knowledge about them suppose but a man not to have a perfect exact idea of a right angle a scalenum or trapezium and there is nothing more certain than that he will in vain seek any demonstration about them further it is evident that it was not the influence of those maxims which are taken for principles in mathematics that hath led the masters of that science into those wonderful discoveries they have made let a man of good parts know all the maxims generally made use of in mathematics ever so perfectly and contemplate their extent and consequences as much as he pleases he will by their assistance i suppose scarce ever come to know that the square of the hypothenuse in a rightangled triangle is equal to the squares of the two other sides the knowledge that the whole is equal to all its parts and if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equal c helped him not i presume to this demonstration and a man may i think pore long enough on those axioms without ever seeing one jot the more of mathematical truths they have been discovered by the thoughts otherwise applied the mind had other objects other views before it far different from those maxims when it first got the knowledge of such truths in mathematics which men well enough acquainted with those received axioms but ignorant of their method who first made these demonstrations can never sufficiently admire and who knows what methods to enlarge our knowledge in other parts of science may hereafter be invented answering that of algebra in mathematics which so readily finds out the ideas of quantities to measure others by whose equality or proportion we could otherwise very hardly or perhaps never come to know some further considerations concerning our knowledge our knowledge partly necessary partly voluntary our knowledge as in other things so in this has so great a conformity with our sight that it is neither wholly necessary nor wholly voluntary if our knowledge were altogether necessary all mens knowledge would not only be alike but every man would know all that is knowable and if it were wholly voluntary some men so little regard or value it that they would have extreme little or none at all men that have senses cannot choose but receive some ideas by them and if they have memory they cannot but retain some of them and if they have memory they cannot but retain some of them and if they have any distinguishing faculty cannot but perceive the agreement or disagreement of some of them one with another as he that has eyes if he will open them by day cannot but see some objects and perceive a difference in them but though a man with his eyes open in the light cannot but see yet there be certain objects which he may choose whether he will turn his eyes to there may be in his reach a book containing pictures and discourses capable to delight or instruct him which yet he may never have the will to open never take the pains to look into the application of our faculties voluntary but they being employed we know as things are not as we please there is also another thing in a mans power and that is though he turns his eyes sometimes towards an object yet he may choose whether he will curiously survey it and with an intent application endeavour to observe accurately all that is visible in it but yet what he does see he cannot see otherwise than he does it depends not on his will to see that black which appears yellow nor to persuade himself that what actually scalds him feels cold the earth will not appear painted with flowers nor the fields covered with verdure whenever he has a mind to it in the cold winter he cannot help seeing it white and hoary if he will look abroad just thus is it with our understanding all that is voluntary in our knowledge is the employing or withholding any of our faculties from this or that sort of objects and a more or less accurate survey of them but they being employed our will hath no power to determine the knowledge of the mind one way or another that is done only by the objects themselves as far as they are clearly discovered and therefore as far as mens senses are conversant about external objects the mind cannot but receive those ideas which are presented by them and be informed of the existence of things without and so far as mens thoughts converse with their own determined ideas they cannot but in some measure observe the agreement or disagreement that is to be found amongst some of them which is so far knowledge and if they have names for those ideas which they have thus considered they must needs be assured of the truth of those propositions which express that agreement or disagreement they perceive in them and be undoubtedly con vinced of those truths for what a man sees he cannot but see and what he perceives he cannot but know that he perceives instance in numbers thus he that has got the ideas of numbers and hath taken the pains to compare one two and three to six cannot choose but know that they are equal he that hath got the idea of a triangle and found the ways to measure its angles and their magnitudes is certain that its three angles are equal to two right ones and can as little doubt of that as of this truth that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be instance in natural religion he also that hath the idea of an intelligent but frail and weak being made by and depending on another who is eternal omnipotent perfectly wise and good will as certainly know that man is to honour fear and obey god as that the sun shines when he sees it for if he hath but the ideas of two such beings in his mind and will turn his thoughts that way and consider them he will as certainly find that the inferior finite and dependent is under an obligation to obey the supreme and infinite as he is certain to find that three four and seven are less than fifteen if he will consider and compute those numbers nor can he be surer in a clear morning that the sun is risen if he will but open his eyes and turn them that way but yet these truths being ever so certain ever so clear he may be ignorant of either or all of them who will never take the pains to employ his faculties as he should to inform himself about them of judgment our knowledge being short we want something else the understanding faculties being given to man not barely for speculation but also for the conduct of his life man would be at a great loss if he had nothing to direct him but what has the certainty of true knowledge for that being very short and scanty as we have seen he would be often utterly in the dark and in most of the actions of his life perfectly at a stand had he nothing to guide him in the absence of clear and certain knowledge he that will not eat till he has demonstration that it will nourish him he that will not stir till he infallibly knows the business he goes about will succeed will have little else to do but to sit still and perish what use to be made of this twilight state therefore as god has set some things in broad daylight as he has given us some certain knowledge though limited to a few things in comparison probably as a taste of what intellectual creatures are capable of to excite in us a desire and endeavour after a better state so in the greatest part of our concernments he has afforded us only the twilight as i may so say of probability suitable i presume to that state of mediocrity and probationership he has been pleased to place us in here wherein to check our overconfidence and presumption we might by every days experience be made sensible of our shortsightedness and liableness to error the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to us to spend the days of this our pilgrimage with industry and care in the search and following of that way which might lead us to a state of greater perfection it being highly rational to think even were revelation silent in the case that as men employ those talents god has given them here they shall accordingly receive their rewards at the close of the day when their sun shall set and night shall put an end to their labours judgment or assent to probability supplies our want of knowledge the faculty which god has given man to supply the want of clear and certain knowledge in cases where that cannot be had is judgment whereby the mind takes its ideas to agree or disagree or which is the same any proposition to be true or false without perceiving a demonstrative evidence in the proofs the mind sometimes exercises this judgment out of necessity where demonstrative proofs and certain knowledge are not to be had and sometimes out of laziness unskilfulness or haste even where demonstrative and certain proofs are to be had men often stay not warily to examine the agreement or disagreement of two ideas which they are desirous or concerned to know but either incapable of such attention as is requisite in a long train of gradations or impatient of delay lightly cast their eyes on or wholly pass by the proofs and so without making out the demonstration determine of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas as it were by a view of them as they are at a distance and take it to be the one or the other as seems most likely to them upon such a loose survey this faculty of the mind when it is exercised immediately about things is called judgment when about truths delivered in words is most commonly called assent or dissent which being the most usual way wherein the mind has occasion to employ this faculty i shall under these terms treat of it as least liable in our language to equivocation judgement is the presuming things to be so without perceiving it thus the mind has two faculties conversant about truth and falsehood first knowledge whereby it certainly perceives and is undoubtedly satisfied of the agreement or disagreement of any ideas secondly judgment which is the putting ideas together or separating them from one another in the mind when their certain agreement or disagreement is not perceived but presumed to be so which is as the word imports taken to be so before it certainly appears and if it so unites or separates them as in reality things are it is right judgment of probability probability is the appearance of agreement upon fallible proofs as demonstration is the showing the agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of one or more proofs which have a constant immutable and visible connexion one with another so probability is nothing but the appearance of such an agreement or disagreement by the intervention of proofs whose connexion is not constant and immutable or at least is not perceived to be so but is or appears for the most part to be so and is enough to induce the mind to judge the proposition to be true or false rather than the contrary for example in the demonstration of it a man perceives the certain immutable connexion there is of equality between the three angles of a triangle and those intermediate ones which are made use of to show their equality to two right ones and so by an intuitive knowledge of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step of the progress the whole series is continued with an evidence which clearly shows the agreement or disagreement of those three angles in equality to two right ones and thus he has certain knowledge that it is so but another man who never took the pains to observe the demonstration hearing a mathematician a man of credit affirm the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones assents to it ie receives it for true in which case the foundation of his assent is the probability of the thing the proof being such as for the most part carries truth with it the man on whose testimony he receives it not being wont to affirm anything contrary to or besides his knowledge especially in matters of this kind so that that which causes his assent to this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones that which makes him take these ideas to agree without knowing them to do so is the wonted veracity of the speaker in other cases or his supposed veracity in this it is to supply our want of knowledge our knowledge as has been shown being very narrow and we not happy enough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to consider most of the propositions we think reason discoursenay act upon are such as we cannot have undoubted knowledge of their truth yet some of them border so near upon certainty that we make no doubt at all about them but assent to them as firmly and act according to that assent as resolutely as if they were infallibly demonstrated and that our knowledge of them was perfect and certain but there being degrees herein from the very neighbourhood of certainty and demonstration quite down to improbability and unlikeness even to the confines of impossibility and also degrees of assent from full assurance and confidence quite down to conjecture doubt and distrust i shall come now having as i think found out the bounds of human knowledge and certainty in the next place to consider the several degrees and grounds of probability and assent or faith being that which makes us presume things to be true before we know them to be so probability is likeliness to be true the very notation of the word signifying such a proposition for which there be arguments or proofs to make it pass or be received for true the entertainment the mind gives this sort of propositions is called belief assent or opinion which is the admitting or receiving any proposition for true upon arguments or proofs that are found to persuade us to receive it as true without certain knowledge that it is so and herein lies the difference between probability and certainty faith and knowledge that in all the parts of knowledge there is intuition each immediate idea each step has its visible and certain connexion in belief not so that which makes me believe is something extraneous to the thing i believe something not evidently joined on both sides to and so not manifestly showing the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that are under consideration the grounds of probability are two conformity with our own experience or the testimony of others experience probability then being to supply the defect of our knowledge and to guide us where that fails is always conversant about propositions whereof we have no certainty but only some inducements to receive them for true the grounds of it are in short these two following first the conformity of anything with our own knowledge observation and experience secondly the testimony of others vouching their observation and experience in the testimony of others is to be considered the number the integrity the skill of the witnesses the design of the author where it is a testimony out of a book cited the consistency of the parts and circumstances of the relation contrary testimonies in this all the arguments pro and con ought to be examined before we come to a judgment probability wanting that intuitive evidence which infallibly determines the understanding and produces certain knowl edge the mind if it will proceed rationally ought to examine all the grounds of probability and see how they make more or less for or against any proposition before it assents to or dissents from it and upon a due balancing the whole reject or receive it with a more or less firm assent proportionably to the preponderancy of the greater grounds of probability on one side or the other for example if i myself see a man walk on the ice it is past probability it is knowledge but if another tells me he saw a man in england in the midst of a sharp winter walk upon water hardened with cold this has so great conformity with what is usually observed to happen that i am disposed by the nature of the thing itself to assent to it unless some manifest suspicion attend the relation of that matter of fact but if the same thing be told to one born between the tropics who never saw nor heard of any such thing before there the whole probability relies on testimony and as the relators are more in number and of more credit and have no interest to speak contrary to the truth so that matter of fact is like to find more or less belief though to a man whose experience has always been quite contrary and who has never heard of anything like it the most untainted credit of a witness will scarce be able to find belief the king of siam as it happened to a dutch ambassador who entertaining the king of siam with the particularities of holland which he was inquisitive after amongst other things told him that the water in his country would sometimes in cold weather be so hard that men walked upon it and that it would bear an elephant if he were there to which the king replied hitherto i have believed the strange things you have told me because i look upon you as a sober fair man but now i am sure you lie probable arguments capable of great variety upon these grounds depends the probability of any proposition and as the conformity of our knowledge as the certainty of observations as the frequency and constancy of experience and the number and credibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree with it so is any proposition in itself more or less probable there is another i confess which though by itself it be no true ground of probability yet is often made use of for one by which men most commonly regulate their assent and upon which they pin their faith more than anything else and that is the opinion of others though there cannot be a more dangerous thing to rely on nor more likely to mislead one since there is much more falsehood and error among men than truth and knowledge and if the opinions and persuasions of others whom we know and think well of be a ground of assent men have reason to be heathens in japan mahometans in turkey papists in spain protestants in england and lutherans in sweden but of this wrong ground of assent i shall have occasion to speak more at large in another place of the degrees of assent our assent ought to be regulated by the grounds of probability the grounds of probability we have laid down in the foregoing chapter as they are the foundations on which our assent is built so are they also the measure whereby its several degrees are or ought to be regulated only we are to take notice that whatever grounds of probability there may be they yet operate no further on the mind which searches after truth and endeavours to judge right than they appear at least in the first judgment or search that the mind makes i confess in the opinions men have and firmly stick to in the world their assent is not always from an actual view of the reasons that at first prevailed with them it being in many cases almost impossible and in most very hard even for those who have very admirable memories to retain all the proofs which upon a due examination made them embrace that side of the question it suffices that they have once with care and fairness sifted the matter as far as they could and that they have searched into all the particulars that they could imagine to give any light to the question and with the best of their skill cast up the account upon the whole evidence and thus having once found on which side the probability appeared to them after as full and exact an inquiry as they can make they lay up the conclusion in their memories as a truth they have discovered and for the future they remain satisfied with the testimony of their memories that this is the opinion that by the proofs they have once seen of it deserves such a degree of their assent as they afford it these cannot always be actually in view and then we must content ourselves with the remembrance that we once saw ground for such a degree of assent this is all that the greatest part of men are capable of doing in regulating their opinions and judgments unless a man will exact of them either to retain distinctly in their memories all the proofs concerning any probable truth and that too in the same order and regular deduction of consequences in which they have formerly placed or seen them which sometimes is enough to fill a large volume on one single question or else they must require a man for every opinion that he embraces every day to examine the proofs both which are impossible it is unavoidable therefore that the memory be relied on in the case and that men be persuaded of several opinions whereof the proofs are not actually in their thoughts nay which perhaps they are not able actually to recall without this the greatest part of men must be either very sceptic or change every moment and yield themselves up to whoever having lately studied the question offers them arguments which for want of memory they are not able presently to answer the ill consequence of this if our former judgments were not rightly made i cannot but own that mens sticking to their past judgment and adhering firmly to conclusions formerly made is often the cause of great obstinacy in error and mistake but the fault is not that they rely on their memories for what they have before well judged but because they judged before they had well examined may we not find a great number not to say the greatest part of men that think they have formed right judgments of several matters and that for no other reason but because they never thought otherwise that imagine themselves to have judged right only because they never questioned never examined their own opin ions which is indeed to think they judged right because they never judged at all and yet these of all men hold their opinions with the greatest stiffness those being generally the most fierce and firm in their tenets who have least examined them what we once know we are certain is so and we may be secure that there are no latent proofs undiscovered which may overturn our knowledge or bring it in doubt but in matters of probability it is not in every case we can be sure that we have all the particulars before us that any way concern the question and that there is no evidence behind and yet unseen which may cast the probability on the other side and outweigh all that at present seems to preponderate with us who almost is there that hath the leisure patience and means to collect together all the proofs concerning most of the opinions he has so as safely to conclude that he hath a clear and full view and that there is no more to be alleged for his better information and yet we are forced to determine ourselves on the one side or other the conduct of our lives and the management of our great concerns will not bear delay for those depend for the most part on the determination of our judgment in points wherein we are not capable of certain and demonstrative knowledge and wherein it is necessary for us to embrace the one side or the other the right use of it mutual charity and forbearance in a necessary diversity of opinions since therefore it is unavoidable to the greatest part of men if not all to have several opinions without certain and indubitable proofs of their truth and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance lightness or folly for men to quit and renounce their former tenets presently upon the offer of an argument which they cannot immediately answer and show the insufficiency of it would methinks become all men to maintain peace and the common offices of humanity and friendship in the diversity of opinions since we cannot reasonably expect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit his own opinion and embrace ours with a blind resignation to an authority which the understanding of man acknowledges not for however it may often mistake it can own no other guide but reason nor blindly submit to the will and dictates of another if he you would bring over to your sentiments be one that examines before he assents you must give him leave at his leisure to go over the account again and recalling what is out of his mind examine all the particulars to see on which side the advantage lies and if he will not think our arguments of weight enough to engage him anew in so much pains it is but what we often do ourselves in the like case and we should take it amiss if others should prescribe to us what points we should study and if he be one who takes his opinions upon trust how can we imagine that he should renounce those tenets which time and custom have so settled in his mind that he thinks them selfevident and of an unquestionable certainty or which he takes to be impressions he has received from god himself or from men sent by him how can we expect i say that opinions thus settled should be given up to the arguments or authority of a stranger or adversary especially if there be any suspicion of interest or design as there never fails to be where men find themselves ill treated we should do well to commiserate our mutual ignorance and endeavour to remove it in all the gentle and fair ways of information and not instantly treat others ill as obstinate and perverse because they will not renounce their own and receive our opinions or at least those we would force upon them when it is more than probable that we are no less obstinate in not embracing some of theirs for where is the man that has incontestable evidence of the truth of all that he holds or of the falsehood of all he condemns or can say that he has examined to the bottom all his own or other mens opinions the necessity of believing without knowledge nay often upon very slight grounds in this fleeting state of action and blindness we are in should make us more busy and careful to inform ourselves than constrain others at least those who have not thoroughly examined to the bottom all their own tenets must confess they are unfit to prescribe to others and are unreasonable in imposing that as truth on other mens belief which they themselves have not searched into nor weighed the arguments of probabil ity on which they should receive or reject it those who have fairly and truly examined and are thereby got past doubt in all the doctrines they profess and govern themselves by would have a juster pretence to require others to follow them but these are so few in number and find so little reason to be magisterial in their opinions that nothing insolent and imperious is to be expected from them and there is reason to think that if men were better instructed themselves they would be less imposing on others probability is either of sensible matter of fact capable of human testimony or of what is beyond the evidence of our senses but to return to the grounds of assent and the several degrees of it we are to take notice that the propositions we receive upon inducements of probability are of two sorts either concerning some particular existence or as it is usually termed matter of fact which falling under observation is capable of human testimony or else concerning things which being beyond the discovery of our senses are not capable of any such testimony the concurrent experience of all other men with ours produces assurance approaching to knowledge concerning the first of these viz particular matter of fact i where any particular thing consonant to the constant observation of ourselves and others in the like case comes attested by the concurrent reports of all that mention it we receive it as easily and build as firmly upon it as if it were certain knowledge and we reason and act thereupon with as little doubt as if it were perfect demonstration thus if all englishmen who have occasion to mention it should affirm that it froze in england the last winter or that there were swallows seen there in the summer i think a man could almost as little doubt of it as that seven and four are eleven the first therefore and highest degree of probability is when the general consent of all men in all ages as far as it can be known concurs with a mans constant and neverfailing experience in like cases to confirm the truth of any particular matter of fact attested by fair witnesses such are all the stated constitutions and prop erties of bodies and the regular proceedings of causes and effects in the ordinary course of nature this we call an argument from the nature of things themselves for what our own and other mens constant observation has found always to be after the same manner that we with reason conclude to be the effect of steady and regular causes though they come not within the reach of our knowledge thus that fire warmed a man made lead fluid and changes the colour or consistency in wood or charcoal that iron sunk in water and swam in quicksilver these and the like propositions about particular facts being agreeable to our constant experience as often as we have to do with these matters and being generally spoke of when mentioned by others as things found constantly to be so and therefore not so much as controverted by anybodywe are put past doubt that a relation affirming any such thing to have been or any prediction that it will happen again in the same manner is very true these probabilities rise so near to certainty that they govern our thoughts as absolutely and influence all our actions as fully as the most evident demonstration and in what concerns us we make little or no difference between them and certain knowledge our belief thus grounded rises to assurance ii unquestionable testimony and our own experience that a thing is for the most part so produce confidence the next degree of probability is when i find by my own experience and the agreement of all others that mention it a thing to be for the most part so and that the particular instance of it is attested by many and undoubted witnesses vg history giving us such an account of men in all ages and my own experience as far as i had an opportunity to observe confirming it that most men prefer their private advantage to the public if all historians that write of tiberius say that tiberius did so it is extremely probable and in this case our assent has a sufficient foundation to raise itself to a degree which we may call confidence iii fair testimony and the nature of the thing indifferent produce unavoidable assent in things that happen indifferently as that a bird should fly this or that way that it should thunder on a mans right or left hand c when any particular matter of fact is vouched by the concurrent testimony of unsuspected witnesses there our assent is also unavoidable thus that there is such a city in italy as rome that about one thousand seven hundred years ago there lived in it a man called julius caesar that he was a general and that he won a battle against another called pompey this though in the nature of the thing there be nothing for nor against it yet being related by historians of credit and contradicted by no one writer a man cannot avoid believing it and can as little doubt of it as he does of the being and actions of his own acquaintance whereof he himself is a witness experience and testimonies clashing infinitely vary the degrees of probability thus far the matter goes easy enough probability upon such grounds carries so much evidence with it that it naturally determines the judgment and leaves us as little liberty to believe or disbelieve as a demonstration does whether we will know or be ignorant the difficulty is when testimonies contradict common experience and the reports of history and witnesses clash with the ordinary course of nature or with one another there it is where diligence attention and exactness are required to form a right judgment and to proportion the assent to the different evidence and probability of the thing which rises and falls according as those two foundations of credibility viz common observation in like cases and particular testimonies in that particular instance favour or contradict it these are liable to so great variety of contrary observations circumstances reports different qualifications tempers designs oversights c of the reporters that it is impossible to reduce to precise rules the various degrees wherein men give their assent this only may be said in general that as the arguments and proofs pro and con upon due examination nicely weighing every particular circumstance shall to any one appear upon the whole matter in a greater or less degree to preponderate on either side so they are fitted to produce in the mind such different entertainments as we call belief conjecture guess doubt wavering distrust disbelief c traditional testimonies the further removed the less their proof becomes this is what concerns assent in matters wherein testimony is made use of concerning which i think it may not be amiss to take notice of a rule observed in the law of england which is that though the attested copy of a record be good proof yet the copy of a copy ever so well attested and by ever so credible witnesses will not be admitted as a proof in judicature this is so generally approved as reasonable and suited to the wisdom and caution to be used in our inquiry after material truths that i never yet heard of any one that blamed it this practice if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong carries this observation along with it viz that any testimony the further off it is from the original truth the less force and proof it has the being and existence of the thing itself is what i call the original truth a credible man vouching his knowledge of it is a good proof but if another equally credible do witness it from his report the testimony is weaker and a third that attests the hearsay of an hearsay is yet less considerable so that in traditional truths each remove weakens the force of the proof and the more hands the tradition has successively passed through the less strength and evidence does it receive from them this i thought necessary to be taken notice of because i find amongst some men the quite contrary commonly practised who look on opinions to gain force by growing older and what a thousand years since would not to a rational man contemporary with the first voucher have appeared at all probable is now urged as certain beyond all question only because several have since from him said it one after another upon this ground propositions evidently false or doubtful enough in their first beginning come by an inverted rule of probability to pass for authentic truths and those which found or deserved little credit from the mouths of their first authors are thought to grow venerable by age are urged as undeniable yet history is of great use i would not be thought here to lessen the credit and use of history it is all the light we have in many cases and we have in many cases and we receive from it a great part of the useful truths we have with a convincing evidence i think nothing more valuable than the records of antiquity i wish we had more of them and more uncorrupted but this truth itself forces me to say that no probability can rise higher than its first original what has no other evidence than the single testimony of one only witness must stand or fall by his only testimony whether good bad or indifferent and though cited afterwards by hundreds of others one after another is so far from receiving any strength thereby that it is only the weaker passion interest inadvertency mistake of his meaning and a thousand odd reasons or capricios mens minds are acted by impossible to be discovered may make one man quote another mans words or meaning wrong he that has but ever so little examined the citations of writers cannot doubt how little credit the quotations deserve where the originals are wanting and consequently how much less quotations of quotations can be relied on this is certain that what in one age was affirmed upon slight grounds can never after come to be more valid in future ages by being often repeated but the further still it is from the original the less valid it is and has always less force in the mouth or writing of him that last made use of it than in his from whom he received it in things which sense cannot discover analogy is the great rule of probability secondly the probabilities we have hitherto mentioned are only such as concern matter of fact and such things as are capable of observation and testimony there remains that other sort concerning which men entertain opinions with variety of assent though the things be such that falling not under the reach of our senses they are not capable of testimony such are the existence nature and operations of finite immaterial beings without us as spirits angels devils c or the existence of material beings which either for their smallness in themselves or remoteness from us our senses cannot take notice ofas whether there be any plants animals and intelligent inhabitants in the planets and other mansions of the vast universe concerning the manner of operation in most parts of the works of nature wherein though we see the sensible effects yet their causes are unknown and we perceive not the ways and manner how they are produced we see animals are generated nourished and move the loadstone draws iron and the parts of a candle successively melting turn into flame and give us both light and heat these and the like effects we see and know but the causes that operate and the manner they are produced in we can only guess and probably conjecture for these and the like coming not within the scrutiny of human senses cannot be examined by them or be attested by anybody and therefore can appear more or less probable only as they more or less agree to truths that are established in our minds and as they hold proportion to other parts of our knowledge and observation analogy in these matters is the only help we have and it is from that alone we draw all our grounds of probability thus observing that the bare rubbing of two bodies violently one upon another produces heat and very often fire itself we have reason to think that what we call heat and fire consists in a violent agitation of the imperceptible minute parts of the burning matter observing likewise that the different refractions of pellucid bodies produce in our eyes the different appearances of several colours and also that the different ranging and laying the superficial parts of several bodies as of velvet watered silk c does the like we think it probable that the colour and shining of bodies is in them nothing but the different arrangement and refraction of their minute and insensible parts thus finding in all parts of the creation that fall under human observation that there is a gradual connexion of one with another without any great or discernible gaps between in all that great variety of things we see in the world which are so closely linked together that in the several ranks of beings it is not easy to discover the bounds betwixt them we have reason to be persuaded that by such gentle steps things ascend upwards in degrees of perfection it is a hard matter to say where sensible and rational begin and where insensible and irrational end and who is there quicksighted enough to determine precisely which is the lowest species of living things and which the first of those which have no life things as far as we can observe lessen and augment as the quantity does in a regular cone where though there be a manifest odds betwixt the bigness of the diameter at a remote distance yet the difference between the upper and under where they touch one another is hardly discernible the difference is exceeding great between some men and some animals but if we will compare the understanding and abilities of some men and some brutes we shall find so little difference that it will be hard to say that that of the man is either clearer or larger observing i say such gradual and gentle descents downwards in those parts of the creation that are beneath man the rule of analogy may make it probable that it is so also in things above us and our observation and that there are several ranks of intelligent beings excelling us in several degrees of perfection ascending upwards towards the infinite perfection of the creator by gentle steps and differences that are every one at no great distance from the next to it this sort of probability which is the best conduct of rational experiments and the rise of hypothesis has also its use and influence and a wary reasoning from analogy leads us often into the discovery of truths and useful productions which would otherwise lie concealed one case where contrary experience lessens not the testimony though the common experience and the ordinary course of things have justly a mighty influence on the minds of men to make them give or refuse credit to anything proposed to their belief yet there is one case wherein the strangeness of the fact lessens not the assent to a fair testimony given of it for where such supernatural events are suitable to ends aimed at by him who has the power to change the course of nature there under such circumstances that may be the fitter to procure belief by how much the more they are beyond or contrary to ordinary observation this is the proper case of miracles which well attested do not only find credit themselves but give it also to other truths which need such confirmation the bare testimony of divine revelation is the highest certainty besides those we have hitherto mentioned there is one sort of propositions that challenge the highest degree of our assent upon bare testimony whether the thing proposed agree or disagree with common experience and the ordinary course of things or no the reason whereof is because the testimony is of such an one as cannot deceive nor be deceived and that is of god himself this carries with it an assurance beyond doubt evidence beyond exception this is called by a peculiar name revelation and our assent to it faith which as absolutely determines our minds and as perfectly excludes all wavering as our knowledge itself and we may as well doubt of our own being as we can whether any revelation from god be true so that faith is a settled and sure principle of assent and assurance and leaves no manner of room for doubt or hesitation only we must be sure that it be a divine revelation and that we understand it right else we shall expose ourselves to all the extravagancy of enthusiasm and all the error of wrong principles if we have faith and assurance in what is not divine revelation and therefore in those cases our assent can be rationally no higher than the evidence of its being a revelation and that this is the meaning of the expressions it is delivered in if the evidence of its being a revelation or that this is its true sense be only on probable proofs our assent can reach no higher than an assurance or diffidence arising from the more or less apparent probability of the proofs but of faith and the precedency it ought to have before other arguments of persuasion i shall speak more hereafter where i treat of it as it is ordinarily placed in contradistinction to reason though in truth it be nothing else but an assent founded on the highest reason of reason various significations of the word reason the word reason in the english language has different significations sometimes it is taken for true and clear principles sometimes for clear and fair deductions from those principles and sometimes for the cause and particularly the final cause but the consideration i shall have of it here is in a signification different from all these and that is as it stands for a faculty in man that faculty whereby man is supposed to be distinguished from beasts and wherein it is evident he much surpasses them wherein reasoning consists if general knowledge as has been shown consists in a perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas and the knowledge of the existence of all things without us except only of a god whose existence every man may certainly know and demonstrate to himself from his own existence be had only by our senses what room is there for the exercise of any other faculty but outward sense and inward perception what need it there of reason very much both for the enlargement of our knowledge and regulating our assent for it hath to do both in knowledge and opinion and is necessary and assisting to all our other intellectual faculties and indeed contains two of them viz sagacity and illation by the one it finds out and by the other it so orders the intermediate ideas as to discover what connexion there is in each link of the chain whereby the extremes are held together and thereby as it were to draw into view the truth sought for which is that which we call illation or inference and consists in nothing but the perception of the connexion there is between the ideas in each step of the deduction whereby the mind comes to see either the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas as in demonstration in which it arrives at knowledge or their probable connexion on which it gives or withholds its assent as in opinion sense and intuition reach but a very little way the greatest part of our knowledge depends upon deductions and intermediate ideas and in those cases where we are fain to substitute assent instead of knowledge and take propositions for true without being certain they are so we have need to find out examine and compare the grounds of their probability in both these cases the faculty which finds out the means and rightly applies them to discover certainty in the one and probability in the other is that which we call reason for as reason perceives the necessary and indubitable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in each step of any demonstration that produces knowledge so it likewise perceives the probable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in every step of a discourse to which it will think assent due this is the lowest degree of that which can be truly called reason for where the mind does not perceive this probable connexion where it does not discern whether there be any such connexion or no there mens opinions are not the product of judgment or the consequence of reason but the effects of chance and hazard of a mind floating at all adventures without choice and without direction reason in its four degrees so that we may in reason consider these degrees four the first and highest is the discovering and finding out of truths the second the regular and methodical disposition of them and laying them in a clear and fit order to make their connexion and force be plainly and easily perceived the third is the perceiving their connexion and the fourth a making a right conclusion these several degrees may be observed in any mathematical demonstration it being one thing to perceive the connexion of each part as the demonstration is made by another another to perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the parts a third to make out a demonstration clearly and neatly ones self and something different from all these to have first found out these intermediate ideas or proofs by which it is made whether syllogism is the great instrument of reason first cause to doubt this there is one thing more which i shall desire to be considered concerning reason and that is whether syllogism as is generally thought be the proper instrument of it and the usefullest way of exercising this faculty the causes i have to doubt are these first because syllogism serves our reason but in one only of the forementioned parts of it and that is to show the connexion of the proofs in any one instance and no more but in this it is of no great use since the mind can perceive such connexion where it really is as easily nay perhaps better without it men can reason well who cannot make a syllogism if we will observe the actings of our own minds we shall find that we reason best and clearest when we only observe the connexion of the proof without reducing our thoughts to any rule of syllogism and therefore we may take notice that there are many men that reason exceeding clear and rightly who know not how to make a syllogism he that will look into many parts of asia and america will find men reason there perhaps as acutely as himself who yet never heard of a syllogism nor can reduce any one argument to those forms and i believe scarce any one makes syllogisms in reasoning within himself indeed syllogism is made use of on occasion to discover a fallacy hid in a rhetorical flourish or cunningly wrapt up in a smooth period and stripping an absurdity of the cover of wit and good language show it in its naked deformity but the weakness or fallacy of such a loose discourse it shows by the artificial form it is put into only to those who have thoroughly studied mode and figure and have so examined the many ways that three propositions may be put together as to know which of them does certainly conclude right and which not and upon what grounds it is that they do so all who have so far considered syllogism as to see the reason why in three propositions laid together in one form the conclusion will be certainly right but in another not certainly so i grant are certain of the conclusion they draw from the premises in the allowed modes and figures but they who have not so far looked into those forms are not sure by virtue of syllogism that the conclusion certainly follows from the premises they only take it to be so by an implicit faith in their teachers and a confidence in those forms of argumentation but this is still but believing not being certain now if of all mankind those who can make syllogisms are extremely few in comparison of those who cannot and if of those few who have been taught logic there is but a very small number who do any more than believe that syllogisms in the allowed modes and figures do conclude right without knowing certainly that they do so if syllogisms must be taken for the only proper instrument of reason and means of knowledge it will follow that before aristotle there was not one man that did or could know anything by reason and that since the invention of syllogisms there is not one of ten thousand that doth aristotle but god has not been so sparing to men to make them barely twolegged creatures and left it to aristotle to make them rational ie those few of them that he could get so to examine the grounds of syllogisms as to see that in above three score ways that three propositions may be laid together there are but about fourteen wherein one may be sure that the conclusion is right and upon what grounds it is that in these few the conclusion is certain and in the other not god has been more bountiful to mankind than so he has given them a mind that can reason without being instructed in methods of syllogizing the understanding is not taught to reason by these rules it has a native faculty to perceive the coherence or incoherence of its ideas and can range them right without any such perplexing repetitions i say not this any way to lessen aristotle whom i look on as one of the greatest men amongst the ancients whose large views acuteness and penetration of thought and strength of judgment few have equalled and who in this very invention of forms of argumentation wherein the conclusion may be shown to be rightly inferred did great service against those who were not ashamed to deny anything and i readily own that all right reasoning may be reduced to his forms of syllogism but yet i think without any diminution to him i may truly say that they are not the only nor the best way of reasoning for the leading of those into truth who are willing to find it and desire to make the best use they may of their reason for the attainment of knowledge and he himself it is plain found out some forms to be conclusive and others not not by the forms themselves but by the original way of knowledge ie by the visible agreement of ideas tell a country gentlewoman that the wind is southwest and the weather lowering and like to rain and she will easily understand it is not safe for her to go abroad thin clad in such a day after a fever she clearly sees the probable connexion of all these viz southwest wind and clouds rain wetting taking cold relapse and danger of death without tying them together in those artificial and cumbersome fetters of several syllogisms that clog and hinder the mind which proceeds from one part to another quicker and clearer without them and the probability which she easily perceives in things thus in their native state would be quite lost if this argument were managed learnedly and proposed in mode and figure for it very often confounds the connexion and i think every one will perceive in mathematical demonstrations that the knowledge gained thereby comes shortest and clearest without syllogism inference is looked on as the great act of the rational faculty and so it is when it is rightly made but the mind either very desirous to enlarge its knowledge or very apt to favour the sentiments it has once imbibed is very forward to make inferences and therefore often makes too much haste before it perceives the connexion of the ideas that must hold the extremes together syllogism does not discover ideas or their connexions to infer is nothing but by virtue of one proposition laid down as true to draw in another as true ie to see or suppose such a connexion of the two ideas of the inferred proposition vg let this be the proposition laid down men shall be punished in another world and from thence be inferred this other then men can determine themselves the question now is to know whether the mind has made this inference right or no if it has made it by finding out the intermediate ideas and taking a view of the connexion of them placed in a due order it has proceeded rationally and made a right inference if it has done it without such a view it has not so much made an inference that will hold or an inference of right reason as shown a willingness to have it be or be taken for such but in neither case is it syllogism that discovered those ideas or showed the connexion of them for they must be both found out and the connexion everywhere perceived before they can rationally be made use of in syllogism unless it can be said that any idea without considering what connexion it hath with the two other whose agreement should be shown by it will do well enough in a syllogism and may be taken at a venture for the medius terminus to prove any conclusion but this nobody will say because it is by virtue of the perceived agreement of the intermediate idea with the extremes that the extremes are concluded to agree and therefore each intermediate idea must be such as in the whole chain hath a visible connexion with those two it has been placed between or else thereby the conclusion cannot be inferred or drawn in for wherever any link of the chain is loose and without connexion there the whole strength of it is lost and it hath no force to infer or draw in anything in the instance above mentioned what is it shows the force of the inference and consequently the reasonableness of it but a view of the connexion of all the intermediate ideas that draw in the conclusion or proposition inferred vg men shall be punished god the punisher just punishment the punished guilty could have done otherwise freedom selfdetermination by which chain of ideas thus visibly linked together in train ie each intermediate idea agreeing on each side with those two it is immediately placed between the ideas of men and selfdetermination appear to be connected ie this proposition men can determine themselves is drawn in or inferred from this that they shall be punished in the other world for here the mind seeing the connexion there is between the idea of mens punishment in the other world and the idea of god punishing between god punishing and the justice of the punishment between justice of punishment and guilt between guilt and a power to do otherwise between a power to do otherwise and freedom and between freedom and selfdetermination sees the connexion between men and selfdetermination the connexion must be discovered before it can be put into syllogisms now i ask whether the connexion of the extremes be not more clearly seen in this simple and natural disposition than in the perplexed repetitions and jumble of five or six syllogisms i must beg pardon for calling it jumble till somebody shall put these ideas into so many syllogisms and then say that they are less jumbled and their connexion more visible when they are transposed and repeated and spun out to a greater length in artificial forms than in that short and natural plain order they are laid down in here wherein everyone may see it and wherein they must be seen before they can be put into a train of syllogisms for the natural order of the connecting ideas must direct the order of the syllogisms and a man must see the connexion of each intermediate idea with those that it connects before he can with reason make use of it in a syllogism and when all those syllogisms are made neither those that are nor those that are not logicians will see the force of the argumentation ie the connexion of the extremes one jot the better for those that are not men of art not knowing the true forms of syllogism nor the reasons of them cannot know whether they are made in right and conclusive modes and figures or no and so are not at all helped by the forms they are put into though by them the natural order wherein the mind could judge of their respective connexion being disturbed renders the illation much more uncertain than without them and as for the logicians themselves they see the connexion of each intermediate idea with those it stands between on which the force of the inference depends as well before as after the syllogism is made or else they do not see it at all for a syllogism neither shows nor strengthens the connexion of any two ideas immediately put together but only by the connexion seen in them shows what connexion the extremes have one with another but what connexion the intermediate has with either of the extremes in the syllogism that no syllogism does or can show that the mind only doth or can perceive as they stand there in that juxtaposition by its own view to which the syllogistical form it happens to be in gives no help or light at all it only shows that if the intermediate idea agrees with those it is on both sides immediately applied to then those two remote ones or as they are called extremes do certainly agree and therefore the immediate connexion of each idea to that which it is applied to on each side on which the force of the reasoning depends is as well seen before as after the syllogism is made or else he that makes the syllogism could never see it at all this as has been already observed is seen only by the eye or the perceptive faculty of the mind taking a view of them laid together in a juxtaposition which view of any two it has equally whenever they are laid together in any proposition whether that proposition be placed as a major or a minor in a syllogism or no use of syllogism of what use then are syllogisms i answer their chief and main use is in the schools where men are allowed without shame to deny the agreement of ideas that do manifestly agree or out of the schools to those who from thence have learned without shame to deny the connexion of ideas which even to themselves is visible but to an ingenuous searcher after truth who has no other aim but to find it there is no need of any such form to force the allowing of the inference the truth and reasonableness of it is better seen in ranging of the ideas in a simple and plain order and hence it is that men in their own inquiries after truth never use syllogisms to convince themselves or in teaching others to instruct willing learners because before they can put them into a syllogism they must see the connexion that is between the intermediate idea and the two other ideas it is set between and applied to to show their agreement and when they see that they see whether the inference be good or no and so syllogism comes too late to settle it for to make use again of the former instance i ask whether the mind considering the idea of justice placed as an intermediate idea between the punishment of men and the guilt of the punished and till it does so consider it the mind cannot make use of it as a medius terminus does not as plainly see the force and strength of the inference as when it is formed into a syllogism to show it in a very plain and easy example let animal be the intermediate idea or medius terminus that the mind makes use of to show the connexion of homo and vivens i ask whether the mind does not more readily and plainly see that connexion in the simple and proper position of the connecting idea in the middle thus homoanimalvivens than in this perplexed one animalvivenshomoanimal which is the position these ideas have in a syllogism to show the connexion between homo and vivens by the intervention of animal not the only way to detect fallacies indeed syllogism is thought to be of necessary use even to the lovers of truth to show them the fallacies that are often concealed in florid witty or involved discourses but that this is a mistake will appear if we consider that the reason why sometimes men who sincerely aim at truth are imposed upon by such loose and as they are called rhetorical discourses is that their fancies being struck with some lively metaphorical representations they neglect to observe or do not easily perceive what are the true ideas upon which the inference depends now to show such men the weakness of such an argumentation there needs no more but to strip if of the superfluous ideas which blended and confounded with those on which the inference depends seem to show a connexion where there is none or at least to hinder the discovery of the want of it and then to lay the naked ideas on which the force of the argumentation depends in their due order in which position the mind taking a view of them sees what connexion they have and so is able to judge of the inference without any need of a syllogism at all i grant that mode and figure is commonly made use of in such cases as if the detection of the incoherence of such loose discourses were wholly owing to the syllogistical form and so i myself formerly thought till upon a stricter examination i now find that laying the intermediate ideas naked in their due order shows the incoherence of the argumentation better than syllogism not only as subjecting each link of the chain to the immediate view of the mind in its proper place whereby its connexion is best observed but also because syllogism shows the incoherence only to those who are not one of ten thousand who perfectly understand mode and figure and the reason upon which those forms are established whereas a due and orderly placing of the ideas upon which the inference is made makes every one whether logician or not logician who understands the terms and hath the faculty to perceive the agreement or disagreement of such ideas without which in or out of syllogism he cannot perceive the strength or weakness coherence or incoherence of the discourse see the want of connexion in the argumentation and the absurdity of the inference and thus i have known a man unskilful in syllogism who at first hearing could perceive the weakness and inconclusiveness of a long artificial and plausible discourse wherewith others better skilled in syllogism have been misled and i believe there are few of my readers who do not know such and indeed if it were not so the debates of most princes councils and the business of assemblies would be in danger to be mismanaged since those who are relied upon and have usually a great stroke in them are not always such who have the good luck to be perfectly knowing in the forms of syllogism or expert in mode and figure and if syllogism were the only or so much as the surest way to detect the fallacies of artificial discourses i do not think that all mankind even princes in matters that concern their crowns and dignities are so much in love with falsehood and mistake that they would everywhere have neglected to bring syllogism into the debates of moment or thought it ridiculous so much as to offer them in affairs of consequence a plain evidence to me that men of parts and penetration who were not idly to dispute at their ease but were to act according to the result of their debates and often pay for their mistakes with their heads or fortunes found those scholastic forms were of little use to discover truth or fallacy whilst both the one and the other might be shown and better shown without them to those who would not refuse to see what was visibly shown them another cause to doubt whether syllogism be the only proper instrument of reason in the discovery of truth secondly another reason that makes me doubt whether syllogism be the only proper instrument of reason in the discovery of truth is that of whatever use mode and figure is pretended to be in the laying open of fallacy which has been above considered those scholastic forms of discourse are not less liable to fallacies than the plainer ways of argumentation and for this i appeal to common observation which has always found these artificial methods of reasoning more adapted to catch and entangle the mind than to instruct and inform the understanding and hence it is that men even when they are baffled and silenced in this scholastic way are seldom or never convinced and so brought over to the conquering side they perhaps acknowledge their adversary to be the more skilful disputant but rest nevertheless persuaded of the truth on their side and go away worsted as they are with the same opinion they brought with them which they could not do if this way of argumentation carried light and conviction with it and made men see where the truth lay and therefore syllogism has been thought more proper for the attaining victory in dispute than for the discovery or confirmation of truth in fair inquiries and if it be certain that fallacies can be couched in syllogism as it cannot be denied it must be something else and not syllogism that must discover them i have had experience how ready some men are when all the use which they have been wont to ascribe to anything is not allowed to cry out that i am for laying it wholly aside but to prevent such unjust and groundless imputations i tell them that i am not for taking away any helps to the understanding in the attainment of knowledge and if men skilled in and used to syllogisms find them assisting to their reason in the discovery of truth i think they ought to make use of them all that i aim at is that they should not ascribe more to these forms than belongs to them and think that men have no use or not so full an use of their reasoning faculties without them some eyes want spectacles to see things clearly and distinctly but let not those that use them therefore say nobody can see clearly without them those who do so will be thought in favour of art which perhaps they are beholden to a little too much to depress and discredit nature reason by its own penetration where it is strong and exercised usually sees quicker and clearer without syllogism if use of those spectacles has so dimmed its sight that it cannot without them see consequences or inconsequences in argumentation i am not so unreasonable as to be against the using them every one knows what best fits his own sight but let him not thence conclude all in the dark who use not just the same helps that he finds a need of syllogism helps little in demonstration less in probability but however it be in knowledge i think i may truly say it is of far less or no use at all in probabilities for the assent there being to be determined by the preponderancy after due weighing of all the proofs with all circumstances on both sides nothing is so unfit to assist the mind in that as syllogism which running away with one assumed probability or one topical argument pursues that till it has led the mind quite out of sight of the thing under consideration and forcing it upon some remote difficulty holds it fast there entangled perhaps and as it were manacled in the chain of syllogisms without allowing it the liberty much less affording it the helps requisite to show on which side all things considered is the greater probability serves not to increase our knowledge but to fence with the knowledge we suppose we have but let it help us as perhaps may be said in convincing men of their errors and mistakes and yet i would fain see the man that was forced out of his opinion by dint of syllogism yet still it fails our reason in that part which if not its highest perfection is yet certainly its hardest task and that which we most need its help in and that is the finding out of proofs and making new discoveries the rules of syllogism serve not to furnish the mind with those intermediate ideas that may show the connexion of remote ones this way of reasoning discovers no new proofs but is the art of marshalling and ranging the old ones we have already the fortyseventh proposition of the first book of euclid is very true but the discovery of it i think not owing to any rules of common logic a man knows first and then he is able to prove syllogistically so that syllogism comes after knowledge and then a man has little or no need of it but it is chiefly by the finding out those ideas that show the connexion of distant ones that our stock of knowledge is increased and that useful arts and sciences are advanced syllogism at best is but the art of fencing with the little knowledge we have without making any addition to it and if a man should employ his reason all this way he will not do much otherwise than he who having got some iron out of the bowels of the earth should have it beaten up all into swords and put it into his servants hands to fence with and bang one another had the king of spain employed the hands of his people and his spanish iron so he had brought to light but little of that treasure that lay so long hid in the dark entrails of america and i am apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of his reason only in brandishing of syllogisms will discover very little of that mass of knowledge which lies yet concealed in the secret recesses of nature and which i am apt to think native rustic reason as it formerly has done is likelier to open a way to and add to the common stock of mankind rather than any scholastic proceeding by the strict rules of mod and figure other helps to reason than syllogism should be sought i doubt not nevertheless but there are ways to be found to assist our reason in this most useful part and this the judicious hooker encourages me to say who in his eccl pol i ss speaks thus if there might be added the right helps of true art and learning which helps i must plainly confess this age of the world carrying the name of a learned age doth neither much know nor generally regard there would undoubtedly be almost as much difference in maturity of judgment between men therewith inured and that which men now are as between men that are now and innocents i do not pretend to have found or discovered here any of those right helps of art this great man of deep thought mentions but that is plain that syllogism and the logic now in use which were as well known in his days can be none of those he means it is sufficient for me if by a discourse perhaps something out of the way i am sure as to me wholly new and unborrowed i shall have given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries and to seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art which will scarce be found i fear by those who servilely confine themselves to the rules and dictates of others for beaten tracks lead this sort of cattle as an observing roman calls them whose thoughts reach only to imitation non quo eundum est sed quo itur but i can be bold to say that this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension that if they would employ their thoughts on this subject could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge we can reason about particulars and the immediate object of all our reasonings is nothing but particular ideas having here had occasion to speak of syllogism in general and the use of it in reasoning and the improvement of our knowledge it is fit before i leave this subject to take notice of one manifest mistake in the rules of syllogism viz that no syllogistical reasoning can be right and conclusive but what has at least one general proposition in it as if we could not reason and have knowledge about particulars whereas in truth the matter rightly considered the immediate object of all our reasoning and knowledge is nothing but particulars every mans reasoning and knowledge is only about the ideas existing in his own mind which are truly every one of them particular existences and our knowledge and reason about other things is only as they correspond with those particular ideas so that the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our particular ideas is the whole and utmost of all our knowledge universality is but accidental to it and consists only in this that the particular ideas about which it is are such as more than one particular thing can correspond with and be represented by but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas and consequently our knowledge is equally clear and certain whether either or both or neither of those ideas be capable of representing more real beings than one or no one thing more i crave leave to offer about syllogism before i leave it viz may one not upon just ground inquire whether the form syllogism now has is that which in reason it ought to have for the medius terminus being to join the extremes ie the intermediate ideas by its intervention to show the agreement or disagreement of the two in question would not the position of the medius terminus be more natural and show the agreement or disagreement of the extremes clearer and better if it were placed in the middle between them which might be easily done by transposing the propositions and making the medius terminus the predicate of the first and the subject of the second as thus omnis homo est animal omne animal est vivens ergo omnis homo est vivens omne corpus est extensum et solidum nullum extensum et solidum est pura extensio ergo corpus non est pura extensio i need not trouble my reader with instances in syllogisms whose conclusions are particular the same reason hold for the same form in them as well as in the general our reason often fails us reason though it penetrates into the depths of the sea and earth elevates our thoughts as high as the stars and leads us through the vast spaces and large rooms of this mighty fabric yet it comes far short of the real extent of even corporeal being and there are many instances wherein it fails us as i in cases when we have no ideas it perfectly fails us where our ideas fail it neither does nor can extend itself further than they do and therefore wherever we have no ideas our reasoning stops and we are at an end of our reckoning and if at any time we reason about words which do not stand for any ideas it is only about those sounds and nothing else ii because our ideas are often obscure or imperfect our reason is often puzzled and at a loss because of the obscurity confusion or imperfection of the ideas it is employed about and there we are involved in difficulties and contradictions thus not having any perfect idea of the least extension of matter nor of infinity we are at a loss about the divisibility of matter but having perfect clear and distinct ideas of number our reason meets with none of those inextricable difficulties in numbers nor finds itself involved in any contradictions about them thus we having but imperfect ideas of the operations of out minds and of the beginning of motion or thought how the mind produces either of them in us and much imperfecter yet of the operation of god run into great difficulties about free created agents which reason cannot well extricate itself out of iii because we perceive not intermediate ideas to show conclusions our reason is often at a stand because it perceives not those ideas which could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or disagreement of any other two ideas and in this some mens faculties far outgo others till algebra that great instrument and instance of human sagacity was discovered men with amazement looked on several of the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians and could scarce forbear to think the finding several of those proofs to be something more than human iv because we often proceed upon wrong principles the mind by proceeding upon false principles is often engaged in absurdities and difficulties brought into straits and contradictions without knowing how to free itself and in that case it is in vain to implore the help of reason unless it be to discover the falsehood and reject the influence of those wrong principles reason is so far from clearing the difficulties which the building upon false foundations brings a man into that if he will pursue it it entangles him the more and engages him deeper in perplexities v because we often employ doubtful terms as obscure and imperfect ideas often involve our reason so upon the same ground do dubious words and uncertain signs often in discourses and arguings when not warily attended to puzzle mens reason and bring them to a nonplus but these two latter are our fault and not the fault of reason but yet the consequences of them are nevertheless obvious and the perplexities or errors they fill mens minds with are everywhere observable our highest degree of knowledge is intuitive without reasoning some of the ideas that are in the mind are so there that they can be by themselves immediately compared one with another and in these the mind is able to perceive that they agree or disagree as clearly as that it has them thus the mind perceives that an arch of a circle is less than the whole circle as clearly as it does the idea of a circle and this therefore as has been said i call intuitive knowledge which is certain beyond all doubt and needs no probation nor can have any this being the highest of all human certainty in this consists the evidence of all those maxims which nobody has any doubt about but every man does not as is said only assent to but knows to be true as soon as ever they are proposed to his understanding in the discovery of and assent to these truths there is no use of the discursive faculty no need of reasoning but they are known by a superior and higher degree of evidence and such if i may guess at things unknown i am apt to think that angels have now and the spirits of just men made perfect shall have in a future state of thousands of things which now either wholly escape our apprehensions or which our shortsighted reason having got some faint glimpse of we in the dark grope after the next is got by reasoning but though we have here and there a little of this clear light some sparks of bright knowledge yet the greatest part of our ideas are such that we cannot discern their agreement or disagreement by an immediate comparing them and in all these we have need of reasoning and must by discourse and inference make our discoveries now of these there are two sorts which i shall take the liberty to mention here again through reasonings that are demonstrative first those whose agreement or disagreement though it cannot be seen by an immediate putting them together yet may be examined by the intervention of other ideas which can be compared with them in this case when the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea on both sides with those which we would compare is plainly discerned there it amounts to demonstration whereby knowledge is produced which though it be certain yet it is not so easy nor altogether so clear as intuitive knowledge because in that there is barely one simple intuition wherein there is no room for any the least mistake or doubt the truth is seen all perfectly at once in demonstration it is true there is intuition too but not altogether at once for there must be a remembrance of the intuition of the agreement of the medium or intermediate idea with that we compared it with before when we compare it with the other and where there be many mediums there the danger of the mistake is the greater for each agreement or disagreement of the ideas must be observed and seen in each step of the whole train and retained in the memory just as it is and the mind must be sure that no part of what is necessary to make up the demonstration is omitted or overlooked this makes some demonstrations long and perplexed and too hard for those who have not strength of parts distinctly to perceive and exactly carry so many particulars orderly in their heads and even those who are able to master such intricate speculations are fain sometimes to go over them again and there is need of more than one review before they can arrive at certainty but yet where the mind clearly retains the intuition it had of the agreement of any idea with another and that with a third and that with a fourth c there the agreement of the first and the fourth is a demonstration and produces certain knowledge which may be called rational knowledge as the other is intuitive to supply the narrowness of demonstrative and intuitive knowledge we have nothing but judgment upon probable reasoning secondly there are other ideas whose agreement or disagreement can no otherwise be judged of but by the intervention of others which have not a certain agreement with the extremes but an usual or likely one and in these it is that the judgment is properly exercised which is the acquiescing of the mind that any ideas do agree by comparing them with such probable mediums this though it never amounts to knowledge no not to that which is the lowest degree of it yet sometimes the intermediate ideas tie the extremes so firmly together and the probability is so clear and strong that assent as necessarily follows it as knowledge does demonstration the great excellency and use of the judgment is to observe right and take a true estimate of the force and weight of each probability and then casting them up all right together choose that side which has the overbalance intuitive knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately compared together rational knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by the intervention of one or more other ideas judgment is the thinking or taking two ideas to agree or disagree by the intervention of one or more ideas whose certain agreement or disagreement with them it does not perceive but hath observed to be frequent and usual consequences of words and consequences of ideas though the deducing one proposition from another or making inferences in words be a great part of reason and that which it is usually employed about yet the principal act of ratiocination is the finding the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another by the intervention of a third as a man by a yard finds two houses to be of the same length to measure their equality by juxtaposition words have their consequences as the signs of such ideas and things agree or disagree as really they are but we observe it only by our ideas four sorts of arguments before we quit this subject it may be worth our while a little to reflect on four sorts of arguments that men in their reasonings with others do ordinarily make use of to prevail on their assent or at least to awe them as to silence their opposition i argumentum ad verecundiam the first is to allege the opinions of men whose parts learning eminency power or some other cause has gained a name and settled their reputation in the common esteem with some kind of authority when men are established in any kind of dignity it is thought a breach of modesty for others to derogate any way from it and question the authority of men who are in possession of it this is apt to be censured as carrying with it too much pride when a man does not readily yield to the determination of approved authors which is wont to be received with respect and submission by others and it is looked upon as insolence for a man to set up and adhere to his own opinion against the current stream of antiquity or to put it in the balance against that of some learned doctor or otherwise approved writer whoever backs his tenets with such authorities thinks he ought thereby to carry the cause and is ready to style it impudence in any one who shall stand out against them this i think may be called argumentum ad verecundiam ii argumentum ad ignorantiam secondly another way that men ordinarily use to drive others and force them to submit to their judgments and receive their opinion in debate is to require the adversary to admit what they allege as a proof or to assign a better and this i call argumentum ad ignorantiam iii argumentum ad hominem thirdly a third way is to press a man with consequences drawn from his own principles or concessions this is already known under the name of argumentum ad hominem iv argumentum adjudicium the fourth alone advances us in knowledge and judgment the fourth is the using of proofs drawn from any of the foundations of knowledge or probability this i call argumentum adjudicium this alone of all the four brings true instruction with it and advances us in our way to knowledge for it argues not another mans opinion to be right because i out of respect or any other consideration but that of conviction will not contradict him it proves not another man to be in the right way nor that i ought to take the same with him because i know not a better nor does it follow that another man is in the right way because he has shown me that i am in the wrong i may be modest and therefore not oppose another mans persuasion i may be ignorant and not be able to produce a better i may be in an error and another may show me that i am so this may dispose me perhaps for the reception of truth but helps me not to it that must come from proofs and arguments and light arising from the nature of things themselves and not from my shamefacedness ignorance or error above contrary and according to reason by what has been before said of reason we may be able to make some guess at the distinction of things into those that are according to above and contrary to reason according to reason are such propositions whose truth we can discover by examining and tracing those ideas we have from sensation and reflection and by natural deduction find to be true or probable above reason are such propositions whose truth or probability we cannot by reason derive from those principles contrary to reason are such propositions as are inconsistent with or irreconcilable to our clear and distinct ideas thus the existence of one god is according to reason the existence of more than one god contrary to reason the resurrection of the dead above reason above reason also may be taken in a double sense viz either as signifying above probability or above certainty and in that large sense also contrary to reason is i suppose sometimes taken reason and faith not opposite for faith must be regulated by reason there is another use of the word reason wherein it is opposed to faith which though it be in itself a very improper way of speaking yet common use has so authorized it that it would be folly either to oppose or hope to remedy it only i think it may not be amiss to take notice that however faith be opposed to reason faith is nothing but a firm assent of the mind which if it be regulated as is our duty cannot be afforded to anything but upon good reason and so cannot be opposite to it he that believes without having any reason for believing may be in love with his own fancies but neither seeks truth as he ought nor pays the obedience due to his maker who would have him use those discerning faculties he has given him to keep him out of mistake and error he that does not this to the best of his power however he sometimes lights on truth is in the right but by chance and i know not whether the luckiness of the accident will excuse the irregularity of his proceeding this at least is certain that he must be accountable for whatever mistakes he runs into whereas he that makes use of the light and faculties god has given him and seeks sincerely to discover truth by those helps and abilities he has may have this satisfaction in doing his duty as a rational creature that though he should miss truth he will not miss the reward of it for he governs his assent right and places it as he should who in any case or matter whatsoever believes or disbelieves according as reason directs him he that doth otherwise transgresses against his own light and misuses those faculties which were given him to no other end but to search and follow the clearer evidence and greater probability but since reason and faith are by some men opposed we will so consider them in the following chapter of faith and reason and their distinct provinces necessary to know their boundaries it has been above shown that we are of necessity ignorant and want knowledge of all sorts where we want ideas that we are ignorant and want rational knowledge where we want proofs that we want certain knowledge and certainty as far as we want clear and determined specific ideas that we want probability to direct our assent in matters where we have neither knowledge of our own nor testimony of other men to bottom our reason upon from these things thus premised i think we may come to lay down the measures and boundaries between faith and reason the want whereof may possibly have been the cause if not of great disorders yet at least of great disputes and perhaps mistakes in the world for till it be resolved how far we are to be guided by reason and how far by faith we shall in vain dispute and endeavour to convince one another in matters of religion faith and reason what as contradistinguished i find every sect as far as reason will help them make use of it gladly and where it fails them they cry out it is matter of faith and above reason and i do not see how they can argue with any one or ever convince a gainsayer who makes use of the same plea without setting down strict boundaries between faith and reason which ought to be the first point established in all questions where faith has anything to do reason therefore here as contradistinguished to faith i take to be the discovery of the certainty or probability of such propositions or truths which the mind arrives at by deduction made from such ideas which it has got by the use of its natural faculties viz by sensation or reflection faith on the other side is the assent to any proposition not thus made out by the deductions of reason but upon the credit of the proposer as coming from god in some extraordinary way of communication this way of discovering truths to men we call revelation no new simple idea can be conveyed by traditional revelation first then i say that no man inspired by god can by any revelation communicate to others any new simple ideas which they had not before from sensation or reflection for whatsoever impressions he himself may have from the immediate hand of god this revelation if it be of new simple ideas cannot be conveyed to another either by words or any other signs because words by their immediate operation on us cause no other ideas but of their natural sounds and it is by the custom of using them for signs that they excite and revive in our minds latent ideas but yet only such ideas as were there before for words seen or heard recall to our thoughts those ideas only which to us they have been wont to be signs of but cannot introduce any perfectly new and formerly unknown simple ideas the same holds in all other signs which cannot signify to us things of which we have before never had any idea at all thus whatever things were discovered to st paul when he was rapt up into the third heaven whatever new ideas his mind there received all the description he can make to others of that place is only this that there are such things as eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive and supposing god should discover to any one supernaturally a species of creatures inhabiting for example jupiter or saturn for that it is possible there may be such nobody can deny which had six senses and imprint on his mind the ideas conveyed to theirs by that sixth sense he could no more by words produce in the minds of other men those ideas imprinted by that sixth sense than one of us could convey the idea of any colour by the sound of words into a man who having the other four senses perfect had always totally wanted the fifth of seeing for our simple ideas then which are the foundation and sole matter of all our notions and knowledge we must depend wholly on our reason i mean our natural faculties and can by no means receive them or any of them from traditional revelation i say traditional revelation in distinction to original revelation by the one i mean that first impres sion which is made immediately by god on the mind of any man to which we cannot set any bounds and by the other those impressions delivered over to others in words and the ordinary ways of conveying our conceptions one to another traditional revelation may make us know propositions knowable also by reason but not with the same certainty that reason doth secondly i say that the same truths may be discovered and conveyed down from revelation which are discoverable to us by reason and by those ideas we naturally may have so god might by revelation discover the truth of any proposition in euclid as well as men by the natural use of their faculties come to make the discovery themselves in all things of this kind there is little need or use of revelation god having furnished us with natural and surer means to arrive at the knowledge of them for whatsoever truth we come to the clear discovery of from the knowledge and contemplation of our own ideas will always be certainer to us than those which are conveyed to us by traditional revelation for the knowledge we have that this revelation came at first from god can never be so sure as the knowledge we have from the clear and distinct perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas vg if it were revealed some ages since that the three angles of a triangle were equal to two right ones i might assent to the truth of that proposition upon the credit of that tradition that it was revealed but that would never amount to so great a certainty as the knowledge of it upon the comparing and measuring my own ideas of two right angles and the three angles of a triangle the like holds in matter of fact knowable by our senses vg the history of the deluge is conveyed to us by writings which had their original from revelation and yet nobody i think will say he has as certain and clear a knowledge of the flood as noah that saw it or that he himself would have had had he then been alive and seen it for he has no greater an assurance than that of his senses that it is writ in the book supposed writ by moses inspired but he has not so great an assurance that moses wrote that book as if he had seen moses write it so that the assurance of its being a revelation is less still than the assurance of his senses even original revelation cannot be admitted against the clear evidence of reason in propositions then whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas attained either by immediate intuition as in selfevident propositions or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of revelation as necessary to gain our assent and introduce them into our minds because the natural ways of knowledge could settle them there or had done it already which is the greatest assurance we can possibly have of anything unless where god immediately reveals it to us and there too our assurance can be no greater than our knowledge is that it is a revelation from god but yet nothing i think can under that title shake or overrule plain knowledge or rationally prevail with any man to admit it for true in a direct contradiction to the clear evidence of his own understanding for since no evidence of our faculties by which we receive such revelations can exceed if equal the certainty of our intuitive knowledge we can never receive for a truth anything that is directly contrary to our clear and distinct knowledge vg the ideas of one body and one place do so clearly agree and the mind has so evident a perception of their agreement that we can never assent to a proposition that affirms the same body to be in two distant places at once however it should pretend to the authority of a divine revelation since the evidence first that we deceive not ourselves in ascribing it to god secondly that we understand it right can never be so great as the evidence of our own intuitive knowledge whereby we discern it impossible for the same body to be in two places at once and therefore no proposition can be received for divine revelation or obtain the assent due to all such if it be contradictory to our clear intuitive knowledge because this would be to subvert the principles and foundations of all knowledge evidence and assent whatsoever and there would be left no difference between truth and falsehood no measures of credible and incredible in the world if doubtful propositions shall take place before selfevident and what we certainly know give way to what we may possibly be mistaken in in propositions therefore contrary to the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas it will be in vain to urge them as matters of faith they cannot move our assent under that or any other title whatsoever for faith can never convince us of anything that contradicts our knowledge because though faith be founded on the testimony of god who cannot lie revealing any proposition to us yet we cannot have an assurance of the truth of its being a divine revelation greater than our own knowledge since the whole strength of the certainty depends upon our knowledge that god revealed it which in this case where the proposition supposed revealed contradicts our knowledge or reason will always have this objection hanging to it viz that we cannot tell how to conceive that to come from god the bountiful author of our being which if received for true must overturn all the principles and foundations of knowledge he has given us render all our faculties useless wholly destroy the most excellent part of his workmanship our understandings and put a man in a condition wherein he will have less light less conduct than the beast that perisheth for if the mind of man can never have a clearer and perhaps not so clear evidence of anything to be a divine revelation as it has of the principles of its own reason it can never have a ground to quit the clear evidence of its reason to give a place to a proposition whose revelation has not a greater evidence than those principles have traditional revelation much less thus far a man has use of reason and ought to hearken to it even in immediate and original revelation where it is supposed to be made to himself but to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation but are required to pay obedience and to receive the truths revealed to others which by the tradition of writings or word of mouth are conveyed down to them reason has a great deal more to do and is that only which can induce us to receive them for matter of faith being only divine revelation and nothing else faith as we use the word called commonly divine faith has to do with no propositions but those which are supposed to be divinely revealed so that i do not see how those who make revelation alone the sole object of faith can say that it is a matter of faith and not of reason to believe that such or such a proposition to be found in such or such a book is of divine inspiration unless it be revealed that that proposition or all in that book was communicated by divine inspiration without such a revelation the believing or not believing that proposition or book to be of divine authority can never be matter of faith but matter of reason and such as i must come to an assent to only by the use of my reason which can never require or enable me to believe that which is contrary to itself it being impossible for reason ever to procure any assent to that which to itself appears unreasonable in all things therefore where we have clear evidence from our ideas and those principles of knowledge i have above mentioned reason is the proper judge and revelation though it may in consenting with it confirm its dictates yet cannot in such cases invalidate its decrees nor can we be obliged where we have the clear and evident sentience of reason to quit it for the contrary opinion under a pretence that it is matter of faith which can have no authority against the plain and clear dictates of reason things above reason are when revealed the proper matter of faith but thirdly there being many things wherein we have very imperfect notions or none at all and other things of whose past present or future existence by the natural use of our faculties we can have no knowledge at all these as being beyond the discovery of our natural faculties and above reason are when revealed the proper matter of faith thus that part of the angels rebelled against god and thereby lost their first happy state and that the dead shall rise and live again these and the like being beyond the discovery of reason are purely matters of faith with which reason has directly nothing to do or not contrary to reason if revealed are matter of faith and must carry it against probable conjectures of reason but since god in giving us the light of reason has not thereby tied up his own hands from affording us when he thinks fit the light of revelation in any of those matters wherein our natural faculties are able to give a probable determination revelation where god has been pleased to give it must carry it against the probable conjectures of reason because the mind not being certain of the truth of that it does not evidently know but only yielding to the probability that appears in it is bound to give up its assent to such a testimony which it is satisfied comes from one who cannot err and will not deceive but yet it still belongs to reason to judge of the truth of its being a revelation and of the signification of the words wherein it is delivered indeed if anything shall be thought revelation which is contrary to the plain principles of reason and the evident knowledge the mind has of its own clear and distinct ideas there reason must be hearkened to as to a matter within its province since a man can never have so certain a knowledge that a proposition which contradicts the clear principles and evidence of his own knowledge was divinely revealed or that he understands the words rightly wherein it is delivered as he has that the contrary is true and so is bound to consider and judge of it as a matter of reason and not swallow it without examination as a matter of faith revelation in matters where reason cannot judge or but probably ought to be hearkened to first whatever proposition is revealed of whose truth our mind by its natural faculties and notions cannot judge that is purely matter of faith and above reason secondly all propositions whereof the mind by the use of its natural faculties can come to determine and judge from naturally acquired ideas are matter of reason with this difference still that in those concerning which it has but an uncertain evidence and so is persuaded of their truth only upon probable grounds which still admit a possibility of the contrary to be true without doing violence to the certain evidence of its own knowledge and overturning the principles of all reason in such probable propositions i say an evident revelation ought to determine our assent even against probability for where the principles of reason have not evidenced a proposition to be certainly true or false there clear revelation as another principle of truth and ground of assent may determine and so it may be matter of faith and be also above reason because reason in that particular matter being able to reach no higher than probability faith gave the determination where reason came short and revelation discovered on which side the truth lay in matters where reason can afford certain knowledge that is to be hearkened to thus far the dominion of faith reaches and that without any violence or hindrance to reason which is not injured or disturbed but assisted and improved by new discoveries of truth coming from the eternal fountain of all knowledge whatever god hath revealed is certainly true no doubt can be made of it this is the proper object of faith but whether it be a divine revelation or no reason must judge which can never permit the mind to reject a greater evidence to embrace what is less evident nor allow it to entertain probability in opposition to knowledge and certainty there can be no evidence that any traditional revelation is of divine original in the words we receive it and in the sense we understand it so clear and so certain as that of the principles of reason and therefore nothing that is contrary to and inconsistent with the clear and selfevident dictates of reason has a right to he urged or assented to as a matter of faith wherein reason hath nothing to do whatsoever is divine revelation ought to overrule all our opinions prejudices and interest and hath a right to be received with full assent such a submission as this of our reason to faith takes not away the landmarks of knowledge this shakes not the foundations of reason but leaves us that use of our faculties for which they were given us if the boundaries be not set between faith and reason no enthusiasm or extravagancy in religion can be contradicted if the provinces of faith and reason are not kept distinct by these boundaries there will in matters of religion be no room for reason at all and those extravagant opinions and ceremonies that are to be found in the several religions of the world will not deserve to be blamed for to this crying up of faith in opposition to reason we may i think in good measure ascribe those absurdities that fill almost all the religions which possess and divide mankind for men having been principled with an opinion that they must not consult reason in the things of religion however apparently contradictory to common sense and the very principles of all their knowledge have let loose their fancies and natural superstition and have been by them led into so strange opinions and extravagant practices in religion that a considerate man cannot but stand amazed at their follies and judge them so far from being acceptable to the great and wise god that he cannot avoid thinking them ridiculous and offensive to a sober good man so that in effect religion which should most distinguish us from beasts and ought most peculiarly to elevate us as rational creatures above brutes is that wherein men often appear most irrational and more senseless than beasts themselves credo quia impossibile est i believe because it is impossible might in a good man pass for a sally of zeal but would prove a very ill rule for men to choose their opinions or religion by of enthusiasm love of truth necessary he that would seriously set upon the search of truth ought in the first place to prepare his mind with a love of it for he that loves it not will not take much pains to get it nor be much concerned when he misses it there is nobody in the commonwealth of learning who does not profess himself a lover of truth and there is not a rational creature that would not take it amiss to be thought otherwise of and yet for all this one may truly say that there are very few lovers of truth for truths sake even amongst those who persuade themselves that they are so how a man may know whether he be so in earnest is worth inquiry and i think there is one unerring mark of it viz the not entertaining any proposition with greater assurance than the proofs it is built upon will warrant whoever goes beyond this measure of assent it is plain receives not the truth in the love of it loves not truth for truths sake but for some other byeend for the evidence that any proposition is true except such as are selfevident lying only in the proofs a man has of it whatsoever degrees of assent he affords it beyond the degrees of that evidence it is plain that all the surplusage of assurance is owing to some other affec tion and not to the love of truth it being as impossible that the love of truth should carry my assent above the evidence there is to me that it is true as that the love of truth should make me assent to any proposition for the sake of that evidence which it has not that it is true which is in effect to love it as a truth because it is possible or probable that it may not be true in any truth that gets not possession of our minds by the irresistible light of selfevidence or by the force of demonstration the arguments that gain it assent are the vouchers and gage of its probability to us and we can receive it for no other than such as they deliver it to our understandings whatsoever credit or authority we give to any proposition more than it receives from the principles and proofs it supports itself upon is owing to our inclinations that way and is so far a derogation from the love of truth as such which as it can receive no evidence from our passions or interests so it should receive no tincture from them a forwardness to dictate anothers beliefs from whence the assuming an authority of dictating to others and a forwardness to prescribe to their opinions is a constant concomitant of this bias and corruption of our judgments for how almost can it be otherwise but that he should be ready to impose on anothers belief who has already imposed on his own who can reasonably expect arguments and conviction from him in dealing with others whose understanding is not accustomed to them in his dealing with himself who does violence to his own faculties tyrannizes over his own mind and usurps the prerogative that belongs to truth alone which is to command assent by only its own authority ie by and in proportion to that evidence which it carries with it force of enthusiasm in which reason is taken away upon this occasion i shall take the liberty to consider a third ground of assent which with some men has the same authority and is as confidently relied on as either faith or reason i mean enthusiasm which laying by reason would set up revelation without it whereby in effect it takes away both reason and revelation and substitutes in the room of them the ungrounded fancies of a mans own brain and assumes them for a founda tion both of opinion and conduct reason and revelation reason is natural revelation whereby the eternal father of light and fountain of all knowledge communicates to mankind that portion of truth which he has laid within the reach of their natural faculties revelation is natural reason enlarged by a new set of discoveries communicated by god immediately which reason vouches the truth of by the testimony and proofs it gives that they come from god so that he that takes away reason to make way for revelation puts out the light of both and does much what the same as if he would persuade a man to put out his eyes the better to receive the remote light of an invisible star by a telescope rise of enthusiasm immediate revelation being a much easier way for men to establish their opinions and regulate their conduct than the tedious and not always successful labour of strict reasoning it is no wonder that some have been very apt to pretend to revelation and to persuade themselves that they are under the peculiar guidance of heaven in their actions and opinions especially in those of them which they cannot account for by the ordinary methods of knowledge and principles of reason hence we see that in all ages men in whom melancholy has mixed with devotion or whose conceit of themselves has raised them into an opinion of a greater familiarity with god and a nearer admittance to his favour than is afforded to others have often flattered themselves with a persuasion of an immediate intercourse with the deity and frequent communications from the divine spirit god i own cannot be denied to be able to enlighten the understanding by a ray darted into the mind immediately from the fountain of light this they understand he has promised to do and who then has so good a title to expect it as those who are his peculiar people chosen by him and depending on him enthusiastic impulse their minds being thus prepared whatever groundless opinion comes to settle itself strongly upon their fancies is an illumination from the spirit of god and presently of divine authority and whatsoever odd action they find in themselves a strong inclination to do that impulse is concluded to be a call or direction from heaven and must be obeyed it is a commission from above and they cannot err in executing it what is meant by enthusiasm this i take to be properly enthusiasm which though founded neither on reason nor divine revelation but rising from the conceits of a warmed or overweening brain works yet where it once gets footing more powerfully on the persuasions and actions of men than either of those two or both together men being most forwardly obedient to the impulses they receive from themselves and the whole man is sure to act more vigorously where the whole man is carried by a natural motion for strong conceit like a new principle carries all easily with it when got above common sense and freed from all restraint of reason and check of reflection it is heightened into a divine authority in concurrence with our own temper and inclination enthusiasm accepts its supposed illumination without search and proof though the odd opinions and extravagant actions enthusiasm has run men into were enough to warn them against this wrong principle so apt to misguide them both in their belief and conduct yet the love of something extraordinary the ease and glory it is to be inspired and be above the common and natural ways of knowledge so flatters many mens laziness ignorance and vanity that when once they are got into this way of immediate revelation of illumination without search and of certainty without proof and without examination it is a hard matter to get them out of it reason is lost upon them they are above it they see the light infused into their understandings and cannot be mistaken it is clear and visible there like the light of bright sunshine shows itself and needs no other proof but its own evidence they feel the hand of god moving them within and the impulses of the spirit and cannot be mistaken in what they feel thus they support themselves and are sure reasoning hath nothing to do with what they see and feel in themselves what they have a sensible experience of admits no doubt needs no probation would he not be ridiculous who should require to have it proved to him that the light shines and that he sees it it is its own proof and can have no other when the spirit brings light into our minds it dispels darkness we see it as we do that of the sun at noon and need not the twilight of reason to show it us this light from heaven is strong clear and pure carries its own demonstration with it and we may as naturally take a glowworm to assist us to discover the sun as to examine the celestial ray by our dim candle reason enthusiasm how to be discovered this is the way of talking of these men they are sure because they are sure and their persuasions are right because they are strong in them for when what they say is stripped of the metaphor of seeing and feeling this is all it amounts to and yet these similes so impose on them that they serve them for certainty in themselves and demonstration to others the supposed internal light examined but to examine a little soberly this internal light and this feeling on which they build so much these men have they say clear light and they see they have awakened sense and they feel this cannot they are sure be disputed them for when a man says he sees or feels nobody can deny him that he does so but here let me ask this seeing is it the perception of the truth of the proposition or of this that it is a revelation from god this feeling is it a perception of an inclination or fancy to do something or of the spirit of god moving that inclination these are two very different perceptions and must be carefully distinguished if we would not impose upon ourselves i may perceive the truth of a proposition and yet not perceive that it is an immediate revelation from god i may perceive the truth of a proposition in euclid without its being or my perceiving it to be a revelation nay i may perceive i came not by this knowledge in a natural way and so may conclude it revealed without perceiving that it is a revelation of god because there be spirits which without being divinely commissioned may excite those ideas in me and lay them in such order before my mind that i may perceive their connexion so that the knowledge of any proposition coming into my mind i know not how is not a perception that it is from god much less is a strong persuasion that it is true a perception that it is from god or so much as true but however it be called light and seeing i suppose it is at most but belief and assurance and the proposition taken for a revelation is not such as they know to be true but take to be true for where a proposition is known to be true revelation is needless and it is hard to conceive how there can be a revelation to any one of what he knows already if therefore it be a proposition which they are persuaded but do not know to be true whatever they may call it it is not seeing but believing for these are two ways whereby truth comes into the mind wholly distinct so that one is not the other what i see i know to be so by the evidence of the thing itself what i believe i take to be so upon the testimony of another but this testimony i must know to be given or else what ground have i of believing i must see that it is god that reveals this to me or else i see nothing the question then here is how do i know that god is the revealer of this to me that this impression is made upon my mind by his holy spirit and that therefore i ought to obey it if i know not this how great soever the assurance is that i am possessed with it is groundless whatever light i pretend to it is but enthusiasm for whether the proposition supposed to be revealed be in itself evidently true or visibly probable or by the natural ways of knowledge uncertain the proposition that must be well grounded and manifested to be true is this that god is the revealer of it and that what i take to be a revelation is certainly put into my mind by him and is not an illusion dropped in by some other spirit or raised by my own fancy for if i mistake not these men receive it for true because they presume god revealed it does it not then stand them upon to examine upon what grounds they presume it to be a revelation from god or else all their confidence is mere presumption and this light they are so dazzled with is nothing but an ignis fatuus that leads them constantly round in this circle it is a revelation because they firmly believe it and they believe it because it is a revelation enthusiasm fails of evidence that the proposition is from god in all that is of divine revelation there is need of no other proof but that it is an inspiration from god for he can neither deceive nor be deceived but how shall it be known that any proposition in our minds is a truth infused by god a truth that is revealed to us by him which he declares to us and therefore we ought to believe here it is that enthusiasm fails of the evidence it pretends to for men thus possessed boast of a light whereby they say they are enlightened and brought into the knowledge of this or that truth but if they know it to be a truth they must know it to be so either by its own selfevidence to natural reason or by the rational proofs that make it out to be so if they see and know it to be a truth either of these two ways they in vain suppose it to be a revelation for they know it to be true the same way that any other man naturally may know that it is so without the help of revelation for thus all the truths of what kind soever that men uninspired are enlightened with came into their minds and are established there if they say they know it to be true be cause it is a revelation from god the reason is good but then it will be demanded how they know it to be a revelation from god if they say by the light it brings with it which shines bright in their minds and they cannot resist i beseech them to consider whether this be any more than what we have taken notice of already viz that it is a revelation because they strongly believe it to be true for all the light they speak of is but a strong though ungrounded persuasion of their own minds that it is a truth for rational grounds from proofs that it is a truth they must acknowledge to have none for then it is not received as a revelation but upon the ordinary grounds that other truths are received and if they believe it to be true because it is a revelation and have no other reason for its being a revelation but because they are fully persuaded without any other reason that it is true then they believe it to be a revelation only because they strongly believe it to be a revelation which is a very unsafe ground to proceed on either in our tenets or actions and what readier way can there be to run ourselves into the most extravagant errors and miscarriages than thus to set up fancy for our supreme and sole guide and to believe any proposition to be true any action to be right only because we believe it to be so the strength of our persuasions is no evidence at all of their own rectitude crooked things may be as stiff and inflexible as straight and men may be as positive and peremptory in error as in truth how come else the untractable zealots in different and opposite parties for if the light which every one thinks he has in his mind which in this case is nothing but the strength of his own persuasion be an evidence that it is from god contrary opinions have the same title to be inspirations and god will be not only the father of lights but of opposite and contradictory lights leading men contrary ways and contradictory propositions will be divine truths if an ungrounded strength of assurance be an evidence that any proposition is a divine revelation firmness of persuasion no proof that any proposition is from god this cannot be otherwise whilst firmness of persuasion is made the cause of believing and confidence of being in the right is made an argument of truth st paul himself believed he did well and that he had a call to it when he persecuted the christians whom he confidently thought in the wrong but yet it was he and not they who were mistaken good men are men still liable to mistakes and are sometimes warmly engaged in errors which they take for divine truths shining in their minds with the clearest light light in the mind what light true light in the mind is or can be nothing else but the evidence of the truth of any proposition and if it be not a selfevident proposition all the light it has or can have is from the clearness and validity of those proofs upon which it is received to talk of any other light in the understanding is to put ourselves in the dark or in the power of the prince of darkness and by our own consent to give ourselves up to delusion to believe a lie for if strength of persuasion be the light which must guide us i ask how shall any one distinguish between the delusions of satan and the inspirations of the holy ghost he can transform himself into an angel of light and they who are led by this son of the morning are as fully satisfied of the illumination ie are as strongly persuaded that they are en lightened by the spirit of god as any one who is so they acquiesce and rejoice in it are actuated by it and nobody can be more sure nor more in the right if their own belief may be judge than they revelation must be judged of by reason he therefore that will not give himself up to all the extravagances of delusion and error must bring this guide of his light within to the trial god when he makes the prophet does not unmake the man he leaves all his faculties in the natural state to enable him to judge of his inspirations whether they be of divine original or no when he illuminates the mind with supernatural light he does not extinguish that which is natural if he would have us assent to the truth of any proposition he either evidences that truth by the usual methods of natural reason or else makes it known to be a truth which he would have us assent to by his authority and convinces us that it is from him by some marks which reason cannot be mistaken in reason must be our last judge and guide in everything i do not mean that we must consult reason and examine whether a proposition revealed from god can be made out by natural principles and if it cannot that then we may reject it but consult it we must and by it examine whether it be a revelation from god or no and if reason finds it to be revealed from god reason then declares for it as much as for any other truth and makes it one of her dictates every conceit that thoroughly warms our fancies must pass for an inspiration if there be nothing but the strength of our persuasions whereby to judge of our persuasions if reason must not examine their truth by something extrinsical to the persuasions themselves inspirations and delusions truth and falsehood will have the same measure and will not be possible to be distinguished belief no proof of revelation if this internal light or any proposition which under that title we take for inspired be conformable to the principles of reason or to the word of god which is attested revelation reason warrants it and we may safely receive it for true and be guided by it in our belief and actions if it receive no testimony nor evidence from either of these rules we cannot take it for a revelation or so much as for true till we have some other mark that it is a revelation besides our believing that it is so thus we see the holy men of old who had revelations from god had something else besides that internal light of assurance in their own minds to testify to them that it was from god they were not left to their own persuasions alone that those persuasions were from god but had outward signs to convince them of the author of those revelations and when they were to convince others they had a power given them to justify the truth of their commission from heaven and by visible signs to assert the divine authority of a message they were sent with moses saw the bush burn without being consumed and heard a voice out of it this was something besides finding an impulse upon his mind to go to pharaoh that he might bring his brethren out of egypt and yet he thought not this enough to authorize him to go with that message till god by another miracle of his rod turned into a serpent had assured him of a power to testify his mission by the same miracle repeated before them whom he was sent to gideon was sent by an angel to deliver israel from the midianites and yet he desired a sign to convince him that this commission was from god these and several the like instances to be found among the prophets of old are enough to show that they thought not an inward seeing or persuasion of their own minds without any other proof a sufficient evidence that it was from god though the scripture does not everywhere mention their demanding or having such proofs criteria of a divine revelation in what i have said i am far from denying that god can or doth sometimes enlighten mens minds in the apprehending of certain truths or excite them to good actions by the immediate influence and assistance of the holy spirit without any extraordinary signs accompanying it but in such cases too we have reason and scripture unerring rules to know whether it be from god or no where the truth embraced is consonant to the revelation in the written word of god or the action conformable to the dictates of right reason or holy writ we may be assured that we run no risk in entertaining it as such because though perhaps it be not an immediate revelation from god extraordinarily operating on our minds yet we are sure it is warranted by that revelation which he has given us of truth but it is not the strength of our private persuasion within ourselves that can warrant it to be a light or motion from heaven nothing can do that but the written word of god without us or that standard of reason which is common to us with all men where reason or scripture is express for any opinion or action we may receive it as of divine authority but it is not the strength of our own persuasions which can by itself give it that stamp the bent of our own minds may favour it as much as we please that may show it to be a fondling of our own but will by no means prove it to be an offspring of heaven and of divine original of wrong assent or error causes of error or how men come to give assent contrary to probability knowledge being to be had only of visible and certain truth error is not a fault of our knowledge but a mistake of our judgment giving assent to that which is not true but if assent be grounded on likelihood if the proper object and motive of our assent be probability and that probability consists in what is laid down in the foregoing chapters it will be demanded how men come to give their assents contrary to probability for there is nothing more common than contrariety of opinions nothing more obvious than that one man wholly disbelieves what another only doubts of and a third stedfastly believes and firmly adheres to the reasons whereof though they may be very various yet i suppose may all be reduced to these four i want of proofs ii want of ability to use them iii want of will to see them iv wrong measures of probability first cause of error want of proofs first by want of proofs i do not mean only the want of those proofs which are nowhere extant and so are nowhere to be had but the want even of those proofs which are in being or might be procured and thus men want proofs who have not the convenience or opportunity to make experiments and observations themselves tending to the proof of any proposition nor likewise the convenience to inquire into and collect the testimonies of others and in this state are the greatest part of mankind who are given up to labour and enslaved to the necessity of their mean condition whose lives are worn out only in the provisions for living these mens opportunities of knowledge and inquiry are commonly as narrow as their fortunes and their understandings are but little instructed when all their whole time and pains are laid out to still the croaking of their own bellies or the cries of their children it is not to be expected that a man who drudges on all his life in a laborious trade should be more knowing in the variety of things done in the world than a packhorse who is driven constantly forwards and backwards in a narrow lane and dirty road only to market should be skilled in the geography of the country nor is it at all more possible that he who wants leisure books and languages and the opportunity of conversing with variety of men should be in a condition to collect those testimonies and observations which are in being and are necessary to make out many nay most of the propositions that in the societies of men are judged of the greatest moment or to find out grounds of assurance so great as the belief of the points he would build on them is thought necessary so that a great part of mankind are by the natural and unalterable state of things in this world and the constitution of human affairs unavoidably given over to invincible ignorance of those proofs on which others build and which are necessary to establish those opinions the greatest part of men having much to do to get the means of living are not in a condition to look after those of learned and laborious inquiries objection what shall become of those who want proofs answered what shall we say then are the greatest part of mankind by the necessity of their condition subjected to unavoidable ignorance in those things which are of greatest importance to them for of those it is obvious to inquire have the bulk of mankind no other guide but accident and blind chance to conduct them to their happiness or misery are the current opinions and licensed guides of every country sufficient evidence and security to every man to venture his great concernments on nay his everlasting happiness or misery or can those be the certain and infallible oracles and standards of truth which teach one thing in christendom and another in turkey or shall a poor countryman be eternally happy for having the chance to be born in italy or a daylabourer be unavoidably lost because he had the illluck to be born in england how ready some men may be to say some of these things i will not here examine but this i am sure that men must allow one or other of these to be true let them choose which they please or else grant that god has furnished men with faculties sufficient to direct them in the way they should take if they will but seriously employ them that way when their ordinary vocations allow them the leisure no man is so wholly taken up with the attendance on the means of living as to have no spare time at all to think of his soul and inform himself in matters of religion were men as intent upon this as they are on things of lower concernment there are none so enslaved to the necessities of life who might not find many vacancies that might be husbanded to this advantage of their knowledge people hindered from inquiry besides those whose improvements and informations are straitened by the narrowness of their fortunes there are others whose largeness of fortune would plentifully enough supply books and other requisites for clearing of doubts and discovering of truth but they are cooped in close by the laws of their countries and the strict guards of those whose interest it is to keep them ignorant lest knowing more they should believe the less in them these are as far nay further from the liberty and opportunities of a fair inquiry than these poor and wretched labourers we before spoke of and however they may seem high and great are confined to narrowness of thought and enslaved in that which should be the freest part of man their understandings this is generally the case of all those who live in places where care is taken to propagate truth without knowledge where men are forced at a venture to be of the religion of the country and must therefore swallow down opinions as silly people do empirics pills without knowing what they are made of or how they will work and having nothing to do but believe that they will do the cure but in this are much more miserable than they in that they are not at liberty to refuse swallowing what perhaps they had rather let alone or to choose the physician to whose conduct they would trust themselves second cause of error want of skill to use proofs secondly those who want skill to use those evidences they have of probabilities who cannot carry a train of consequences in their heads nor weigh exactly the preponderancy of contrary proofs and testimonies making every circumstance its due allowance may be easily misled to assent to positions that are not probable there are some men of one some but of two syllogisms and no more and others that can but advance one step further these cannot always discern that side on which the strongest proofs lie cannot constantly follow that which in itself is the more probable opinion now that there is such a difference between men in respect of their understandings i think nobody who has had any conversation with his neighbours will question though he never was at westminsterhall or the exchange on the one hand nor at almshouses or bedlam on the other which great difference in mens intellectuals whether it rises from any defect in the organs of the body particularly adapted to thinking or in the dullness or untractableness of those faculties for want of use or as some think in the natural differences of mens souls themselves or some or all of these together it matters not here to examine only this is evident that there is a difference of degrees in mens understandings apprehensions and reasonings to so great a latitude that one may without doing injury to mankind affirm that there is a greater distance between some men and others in this respect than between some men and some beasts but how this comes about is a speculation though of great consequence yet not necessary to our present purpose third cause of error want of will to use them thirdly there are another sort of people that want proofs not because they are out of their reach but because they will not use them who though they have riches and leisure enough and want neither parts nor other helps are yet never the better for them their hot pursuit of pleasure or constant drudgery in business engages some mens thoughts elsewhere laziness and oscitancy in general or a particular aversion for books study and meditation keep others from any serious thoughts at all and some out of fear that an impartial inquiry would not favour those opinions which best suit their prejudices lives and designs content themselves without examination to take upon trust what they find convenient and in fashion thus most men even of those that might do otherwise pass their lives without an acquaintance with much less a rational assent to probabilities they are concerned to know though they lie so much within their view that to be convinced of them they need but turn their eyes that way we know some men will not read a letter which is supposed to bring ill news and many men forbear to cast up their accounts or so much as think upon their estates who have reason to fear their affairs are in no very good posture how men whose plentiful fortunes allow them leisure to improve their understandings can satisfy themselves with a lazy ignorance i cannot tell but methinks they have a low opinion of their souls who lay out all their incomes in provisions for the body and employ none of it to procure the means and helps of knowledge who take great care to appear always in a neat and splendid outside and would think themselves miserable in coarse clothes or a patched coat and yet contentedly suffer their minds to appear abroad in a piebald livery of coarse patches and borrowed shreds such as it has pleased chance or their country tailor i mean the common opinion of those they have conversed with to clothe them in i will not here mention how unreasonable this is for men that ever think of a future state and their concernment in it which no rational man can avoid to do sometimes nor shall i take notice what a shame and confusion it is to the greatest contemners of knowledge to be found ignorant in things they are concerned to know but this at least is worth the consideration of those who call themselves gentlemen that however they may think credit respect power and authority the concomitants of their birth and fortune yet they will find all these still carried away from them by men of lower condition who surpass them in knowledge they who are blind will always be led by those that see or else fall into the ditch and he is certainly the most subjected the most enslaved who is so in his understanding in the foregoing instances some of the causes have been shown of wrong assent and how it comes to pass that probable doctrines are not always received with an assent proportionable to the reasons which are to be had for their probability but hitherto we have considered only such probabilities whose proofs do exist but do not appear to him who embraces the error fourth cause of error wrong measures of probability fourthly there remains yet the last sort who even where the real probabilities appear and are plainly laid before them do not admit of the conviction nor yield unto manifest reasons but do either epechein suspend their assent or give it to the less probable opinion and to this danger are those exposed who have taken up wrong measures of probability which are i propositions that are not in themselves certain and evident but doubtful and false taken up for principles ii received hypotheses iii predominant passions or inclinations iv authority i doubtful propositions taken for principles the first and firmest ground of probability is the conformity anything has to our own knowledge especially that part of our knowledge which we have embraced and continue to look on as principles these have so great an influence upon our opinions that it is usually by them we judge of truth and measure probability to that degree that what is inconsistent with our principles is so far from passing for probable with us that it will not be allowed possible the reverence borne to these principles is so great and their authority so paramount to all other that the testimony not only of other men but the evidence of our own senses are often rejected when they offer to vouch anything contrary to these established rules how much the doctrine of innate principles and that principles are not to be proved or questioned has contributed to this i will not here examine this i readily grant that one truth cannot contradict another but withal i take leave also to say that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admits for a principle to examine it strictly and see whether he certainly knows it to be true of itself by its own evidence or whether he does only with assurance believe it to be so upon the authority of others for he hath a strong bias put into his understanding which will unavoidably misguide his assent who hath imbibed wrong principles and has blindly given himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently true instilled in childhood there is nothing more ordinary than childrens receiving into their minds propositions especially about matters of religion from their parents nurses or those about them which being insinuated into their unwary as well as unbiassed understandings and fastened by degrees are at last equally whether true or false riveted there by long custom and education beyond all possibility of being pulled out again for men when they are grown up reflecting upon their opinions and finding those of this sort to be as ancient in their minds as their very memories not having observed their early insinuation nor by what means they got them they are apt to reverence them as sacred things and not to suffer them to be profaned touched or questioned they look on them as the urim and thummim set up in their minds immediately by god himself to be the great and unerring deciders of truth and falsehood and the judges to which they are to appeal in all manner of controversies of irresistible efficacy this opinion of his principles let them be what they will being once established in any ones mind it is easy to be imagined what reception any proposition shall find how clearly soever proved that shall invalidate their authority or at all thwart these internal oracles whereas the grossest absurdities and improbabilities being but agreeable to such principles go down glibly and are easily digested the great obstinacy that is to be found in men firmly believing quite contrary opinions though many times equally absurd in the various religions of mankind are as evident a proof as they are an unavoidable consequence of this way of reasoning from received traditional principles so that men will disbelieve their own eyes renounce the evidence of their senses and give their own experience the lie rather than admit of anything disagreeing with these sacred tenets take an intelligent romanist that from the first dawning of any notions in his understanding hath had this principle constantly inculcated viz that he must believe as the church ie those of his communion believes or that the pope is infallible and this he never so much as heard questioned till at forty or fifty years old he met with one of other principles how is he prepared easily to swallow not only against all probability but even the clear evidence of his senses the doctrine of transubstantiation this principle has such an influence on his mind that he will believe that to be flesh which he sees to be bread and what way will you take to convince a man of any improbable opinion he holds who with some philosophers hath laid down this as a foundation of reasoning that he must believe his reason for so men improperly call arguments drawn from their principles against his senses let an enthusiast be principled that he or his teacher is inspired and acted by an immediate communication of the divine spirit and you in vain bring the evidence of clear reasons against his doctrine whoever therefore have imbibed wrong principles are not in things inconsistent with these principles to be moved by the most apparent and convincing probabilities till they are so candid and ingenuous to themselves as to be persuaded to examine even those very principles which many never suffer themselves to do ii received hypotheses next to these are men whose understandings are cast into a mould and fashioned just to the size of a received hypothesis the difference between these and the former is that they will admit of matter of fact and agree with dissenters in that but differ only in assigning of reasons and explaining the manner of operation these are not at that open defiance with their senses with the former they can endure to hearken to their information a little more patiently but will by no means admit of their reports in the explanation of things nor be prevailed on by probabilities which would convince them that things are not brought about just after the same manner that they have decreed within themselves that they are would it not be an insufferable thing for a learned professor and that which his scarlet would blush at to have his authority of forty years standing wrought out of hard rock greek and latin with no small expense of time and candle and confirmed by general tradition and a reverend beard in an instant overturned by an upstart novelist can any one expect that he should be made to confess that what he taught his scholars thirty years ago was all error and mistake and that he sold them hard words and ignorance at a very dear rate what probabilities i say are sufficient to prevail in such a case and who ever by the most cogent arguments will be prevailed with to disrobe himself at once of all his old opinions and pretences to knowledge and learning which with hard study he hath all this time been labouring for and turn himself out stark naked in quest afresh of new notions all the arguments that can be used will be as little able to prevail as the wind did with the traveller to part with his cloak which he held only the faster to this of wrong hypothesis may be reduced the errors that may be occasioned by a true hypothesis or right principles but not rightly understood there is nothing more familiar than this the instances of men contending for different opinions which they all derive from the infallible truth of the scripture are an undeniable proof of it all that call themselves christians allow the text that says metanoeite to carry in it the obligation to a very weighty duty but yet how very erroneous will one of their practices be who understanding nothing but the french take this rule with one translation to be repentezvous repent or with the other fatiez penitence do penance iii predominant passions probabilities which cross mens appetites and prevailing passions run the same fate let ever so much probability hang on one side of a covetous mans reasoning and money on the other it is easy to foresee which will outweigh earthly minds like mud walls resist the strongest batteries and though perhaps sometimes the force of a clear argument may make some impression yet they nevertheless stand firm and keep out the enemy truth that would captivate or disturb them tell a man passionately in love that he is jilted bring a score of witnesses of the falsehood of his mistress it is ten to one but three kind words of hers shall invalidate all their testimonies quod volumus facile credimus what suits our wishes is forwardly believed is i suppose what every one hath more than once experimented and though men cannot always openly gainsay or resist the force of manifest probabilities that make against them yet yield they not to the argument not but that it is the nature of the understanding constantly to close with the more probable side but yet a man hath a power to suspend and restrain its inquiries and not permit a full and satisfactory examination as far as the matter in question is capable and will bear it to be made until that be done there will be always these two ways left of evading the most apparent probabilities two means of evading probabilities i supposed fallacy latent in the words employed first that the arguments being as for the most part they are brought in words there may be a fallacy latent in them and the consequences being perhaps many in train they may be some of them incoherent there are very few discourses so short clear and consistent to which most men may not with satisfaction enough to themselves raise this doubt and from whose conviction they may not without reproach of disingenuity or unreasonableness set themselves free with the old reply non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris though i cannot answer i will not yield supposed unknown arguments for the contrary secondly manifest probabilities may be evaded and the assent withheld upon this suggestion that i know not yet all that may he said on the contrary side and therefore though i be beaten it is not necessary i should yield not knowing what forces there are in reserve behind this is a refuge against conviction so open and so wide that it is hard to determine when a man is quite out of the verge of it what probabilities naturally determine the assent but yet there is some end of it and a man having carefully inquired into all the grounds of probability and unlikeliness done his utmost to inform himself in all particulars fairly and cast up the sum total on both sides may in most cases come to acknowledge upon the whole matter on which side the probability rests wherein some proofs in matter of reason being suppositions upon universal experience are so cogent and clear and some testimonies in matter of fact so universal that he cannot refuse his assent so that i think we may conclude that in propositions where though the proofs in view are of most moment yet there are sufficient grounds to suspect that there is either fallacy in words or certain proofs as considerable to be produced on the contrary side there assent suspense or dissent are often voluntary actions but where the proofs are such as make it highly probable and there is not sufficient ground to suspect that there is either fallacy of words which sober and serious consideration may discover nor equally valid proofs yet undiscovered latent on the other side which also the nature of the thing may in some cases make plain to a considerate man there i think a man who has weighed them can scarce refuse his assent to the side on which the greater probability appears whether it be probable that a promiscuous jumble of printing letters should often fall into a method and order which should stamp on paper a coherent discourse or that a blind fortuitous concourse of atoms not guided by an understanding agent should frequently constitute the bodies of any species of animals in these and the like cases i think nobody that considers them can be one jot at a stand which side to take nor at all waver in his assent lastly when there can be no supposition the thing in its own nature in different and wholly depending upon the testimony of witnesses that there is as fair testimony against as for the matter of fact attested which by inquiry is to be learned vg whether there was one thousand seven hundred years ago such a man at rome as julius caesar in all such cases i say i think it is not in any rational mans power to refuse his assent but that it necessarily follows and closes with such probabilities in other less clear cases i think it is in mans power to suspend his assent and perhaps content himself with the proofs he has if they favour the opinion that suits with his inclination or interest and so stop from further search but that a man should afford his assent to that side on which the less probability appears to him seems to me utterly impracticable and as impossible as it is to believe the same thing probable and improbable at the same time where it is in our power to suspend our judgment as knowledge is no more arbitrary than perception so i think assent is no more in our power than knowledge when the agreement of any two ideas appears to our minds whether immediately or by the assistance of reason i can no more refuse to perceive no more avoid knowing it than i can avoid seeing those objects which i turn my eyes to and look on in daylight and what upon full examination i find the most probable i cannot deny my assent to but though we cannot hinder our knowledge where the agreement is once perceived nor our assent where the probability manifestly appears upon due consideration of all the measures of it yet we can hinder both knowledge and assent by stopping our inquiry and not employing our faculties in the search of any truth if it were not so ignorance error or infidelity could not in any case be a fault thus in some cases we can prevent or suspend our assent but can a man versed in modern or ancient history doubt whether there is such a place as rome or whether there was such a man as julius caesar indeed there are millions of truths that a man is not or may not think himself concerned to know as whether our king richard the third was crooked or no or whether roger bacon was a mathematician or a magician in these and such like cases where the assent one way or other is of no importance to the interest of any one no action no concernment of his following or depending thereon there it is not strange that the mind should give itself up to the common opinion or render itself to the first comer these and the like opinions are of so little weight and moment that like motes in the sun their tendencies are very rarely taken notice of they are there as it were by chance and the mind lets them float at liberty but where the mind judges that the proposition has concernment in it where the assent or not assenting is thought to draw consequences of moment after it and good and evil to depend on choosing or refusing the right side and the mind sets itself seriously to inquire and examine the probability there i think it is not in our choice to take which side we please if manifest odds appear on either the greater probability i think in that case will determine the assent and a man can no more avoid assenting or taking it to be true where he perceives the greater probability than he can avoid knowing it to be true where he perceives the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas if this be so the foundation of error will lie in wrong measures of probability as the foundation of vice in wrong measures of good iv authority the fourth and last wrong measure of probability i shall take notice of and which keeps in ignorance or error more people than all the other together is that which i have mentioned in the foregoing chapter i mean the giving up our assent to the common received opinions either of our friends or party neighbourhood or country how many men have no other ground for their tenets than the supposed honesty or learning or number of those of the same profession as if honest or bookish men could not err or truth were to be established by the vote of the multitude yet this with most men serves the turn the tenet has had the attestation of reverend antiquity it comes to me with the passport of former ages and therefore i am secure in the reception i give it other men have been and are of the same opinion for that is all is said and therefore it is reasonable for me to embrace it a man may more justifiably throw up cross and pile for his opin ions than take them up by such measures all men are liable to error and most men are in many points by passion or interest under temptation to it if we could but see the secret motives that influenced the men of name and learning in the world and the leaders of parties we should not always find that it was the embracing of truth for its own sake that made them espouse the doctrines they owned and maintained this at least is certain there is not an opinion so absurd which a man may not receive upon this ground there is no error to be named which has not had its professors and a man shall never want crooked paths to walk in if he thinks that he is in the right way wherever he has the footsteps of others to follow not so many men in errors as is commonly supposed but notwithstanding the great noise is made in the world about errors and opinions i must do mankind that right as to say there are not so many men in errors and wrong opinions as is commonly supposed not that i think they embrace the truth but indeed because concerning those doctrines they keep such a stir about they have no thought no opinion at all for if any one should a little catechise the greatest part of the partizans of most of the sects in the world he would not find concerning those matters they are so zealous for that they have any opinions of their own much less would he have reason to think that they took them upon the examination of arguments and appearance of probability they are resolved to stick to a party that education or interest has engaged them in and there like the common soldiers of an army show their courage and warmth as their leaders direct without ever examining or so much as knowing the cause they contend for if a mans life shows that he has no serious regard for religion for what reason should we think that he beats his head about the opinions of his church and troubles himself to examine the grounds of this or that doctrine it is enough for him to obey his leaders to have his hand and his tongue ready for the support of the common cause and thereby approve himself to those who can give him credit preferment or protection in that society thus men become professors of and com batants for those opinions they were never convinced of nor proselytes to no nor ever had so much as floating in their heads and though one cannot say there are fewer improbable or erroneous opinions in the world than there are yet this is certain there are fewer that actually assent to them and mistake them for truths than is imagined of the division of the sciences science may be divided into three sorts all that can fall within the compass of human understanding being either first the nature of things as they are in themselves their relations and their manner of operation or secondly that which man himself ought to do as a rational and voluntary agent for the attainment of any end especially happiness or thirdly the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated i think science may be divided properly into these three sorts physica first the knowledge of things as they are in their own proper beings their constitution properties and operations whereby i mean not only matter and body but spirits also which have their proper natures constitutions and operations as well as bodies this in a little more enlarged sense of the word i call phusike or natural philosophy the end of this is bare speculative truth and whatsoever can afford the mind of man any such falls under this branch whether it be god himself angels spirits bodies or any of their affections as number and figure c practica secondly praktike the skill of right applying our own powers and actions for the attainment of things good and useful the most considerable under this head is ethics which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions which lead to happiness and the means to practise them the end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth but right and a conduct suitable to it semeiotike thirdly the third branch may be called semeiotike or the doctrine of signs the most usual whereof being words it is aptly enough termed also logike logic the business whereof is to consider the nature of signs the mind makes use of for the understanding of things or conveying its knowledge to others for since the things the mind contemplates are none of them besides itself present to the understanding it is necessary that something else as a sign or representation of the thing it considers should be present to it and these are ideas and because the scene of ideas that makes one mans thoughts cannot be laid open to the immediate view of another nor laid up anywhere but in the memory a no very sure repository therefore to communicate our thoughts to one another as well as record them for our own use signs of our ideas are also necessary those which men have found most convenient and therefore generally make use of are articulate sounds the consideration then of ideas and words as the great instruments of knowledge makes no despicable part of their contemplation who would take a view of human knowledge in the whole extent of it and perhaps if they were distinctly weighed and duly considered they would afford us another sort of logic and critic than what we have been hitherto acquainted with this is the first and most general division of the objects of our understanding this seems to me the first and most general as well as natural division of the objects of our understanding for a man can employ his thoughts about nothing but either the contemplation of things themselves for the discovery of truth or about the things in his own power which are his own actions for the attainment of his own ends or the signs the mind makes use of both in the one and the other and the right ordering of them for its clearer information all which three viz things as they are in themselves knowable actions as they depend on us in order to happiness and the right use of signs in order to knowledge being toto coelo different they seemed to me to be the three great provinces of the intellectual world wholly separate and distinct one from another the end two treatises of government in the former the false principles and foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers are detected and overthrown the latter is an essay concerning the original extent and end of civil government john locke the preface reader thou hast here the beginning and end of a discourse concerning government what fate has otherwise disposed of the papers that should have filled up the middle and were more than all the rest it is not worth while to tell thee these which remain i hope are sufficient to establish the throne of our great restorer our present king william to make good his title in else consent of the people which being the only one of all lawful governments he has more fully and clearly than any prince in christendom and to justify to the world the people of england whose love of their just and natural rights with their resolution to preserve them saved the nation when it war on the very brink of slavery and ruin if these papers have that evidence i flatter myself is to be found in them there will be no great miss of those which are lost and my reader may be satisfied without them for i imagine i shall have neither the time nor inclination to repeat my pains and fill up the wanting part of my answer by tracing sir robert again through all the windings and obscurities which are to be met with in the several branches of his wonderful system the king and body of the nation have since so thoroughly confuted his hypothesis that i suppose nobody hereafter will have either the confidence to appear against our common safety and be again an advocate for slavery or the weakness to be deceived with contradictions dressed up in a popular style and well turned periods for if any one will be at the pains himself in those parts which are here untouched to strip sir roberts discourses of the flourish of doubtful expressions and endeavour to reduce his words to direct positive intelligible propositions and then compare them one with another he will quickly be satisfied there was never so much glib nonsense put together in well sounding english if he think it not worth while to examine his works all through let him make an experiment in that part where he treats of usurpation and let him try whether he can with all his skill make sir robert intelligible and consistent with himself or common sense i should not speak so plainly of a gentleman long since past answering had not the pulpit of late years publicly owned his doctrine and made it the current divinity of the times it is necessary those men who taking on them to be teachers have so dangerously misled others should be openly showed of what authority this their patriarch is whom they have so blindly followed that so they may either retract what upon so ill grounds they have vented and cannot be maintained or else justify those principles which they have preached up for gospel though they had no better an author than an english courtier for i should not have writ against sir robert or taken the pains to show his mistakes inconsistencies and avant of what he so much boasts of and pretends wholly to build on scriptureproofs were there not men amongst us who by crying up his books and espousing his doctrine save me from the reproach of writing against a dead adversary they have been so zealous in this point that if i have done him any wrong i cannot hope they should spare me i wish where they have done the truth and the public wrong they would be as ready to redress it and allow its just weight to this reflection viz that there cannot be done a greater mischief to prince and people than the propagating wrong notions concerning government that so at last all times might not have reason to complain of the drum ecclesiastic if any one really concerned for truth undertake the confutation of my hypothesis i promise him either to recant my mistake upon fair conviction or to answer his difficulties but he must remember two things first that cavilling here and there at some expression or little incident of my discourse is not an answer to my book secondly that i shall not take railing for arguments nor think either of these worth my notice though i shall always look on myself as bound to give satisfaction to any one who shall appear to be conscientiously scrupulous in the point and shall show any just grounds for his scruples i have nothing more but to advertise the reader that a stands for our author o for his observations on hobbes milton c and that a bare quotation of pages always means pages of his patriarcha edit slavery is so vile and miserable an estate of man and so directly opposite to the generous temper and courage of our nation that it is hardly to be conceived that an englishman much less a gentleman should plead for it and truly i should have taken sir robert filmers patriarcha as any other treatise which would persuade all mere that they are slaves and ought to be so for such another exercise of wit as was his who writ the encomium of nero rather than for a serious discourse meant in earnest had not the gravity of the title and epistle the picture in the front of the book and the applause that followed it required me to believe that the author and publisher were both in earnest i therefore took it into my hands with all the expectation and read it through with all the attention due to a treatise that made such a noise at its coming abroad and cannot but confess myself mightily surprised that in a book which was to provide chains for all mankind i should find nothing but a rope of sand useful perhaps to such whose skill and business it is to wise a dust and would blind the people the better to mislead them but in truth not of any force to draw those into bondage who have their eyes open and so much sense about them as to consider that chains are but an ill wearing how much care soever hath been taken to file and polish them if any one think i take too much liberty in speaking so freely of a man who is the great champion of absolute power and the idol of those who worship it i beseech him to make this small allowance for once to one who even after the reading of sir roberts book cannot but think himself as the laws allow him a free man and i know no fault it is to do so unless any one better skilled in the fate of it than i should have it revealed to him that this treatise which has lain dormant so long was the false principles and foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers are detected and overthrown plan it appeared in the world to carry by strength of its arguments all liberty out or it and that from thenceforth our authors short model was to be the pattern in the mount and the perfect standard of politics for the future his system lies in a little compass it is no more but this that all government is absolute monarchy and the ground he builds on is this that no man is born free in this last age a generation of men has sprung up amongst us that would flatter princes with an opinion that they have a divine right to absolute power let the laws by which they are constituted and are to govern and the conditions under which they enter upon their authority be what they will and their engagements to observe them ever so well ratified by solemn oaths and promises to make way for this doctrine they have denied mankind a right to natural freedom whereby they have not only as much as in them lies exposed all subjects to the utmost misery of tyranny and oppression but have also unsettled the titles and shaken the thrones of princes for they too by these mens system except only one are all born slaves and by divine right are subjects to adams right heir as if they had designed to make war upon all government and subvert the very foundations of human society to serve their present turn however we must believe them upon their own bare words when they tell us we are all born slaves and we must continue so there is no remedy for it life and thraldom we entered into together and can never be quit of the one till we part with the other scripture or reason i am sure do not any where say so notwithstanding the noise of divine right as if divine authority hath subjected us to the unlimited will of another an admirable state of mankind and that which they have not lead wit enough to find out till this latter age for however sir robert filmier seems to condemn the novelty of the contrary opinion patr p yet i believe it will be hard for him to find any other age or country of the world but this which has asserted monarchy to be jure divine and he confesses patr p that heyward blackwood barclay and others that have bravely vindicated the right of kings in most points never thought of this but with one consent admitted the natural liberty and equality of mankind by whom this doctrine came at first to be broached and brought in fashion amongst us and what sad elects it gave rise to i leave to historians to relate or to the memory of those who were contemporaries with sibthorp and manwaring to recollect my business at present is only to consider what sir robert filmer who is allowed to have carried this argument farthest and is supposed to have brought it to perfection has said in it for from him every one who would be as fashionable as french was at court has learned and runs away with this short system of politics viz men are not born free and therefore could never have the liberty to choose either governors or forms of government princes have their power absolute and by divine right for slaves could never have a right to compact or consent adam was an absolute monarch and so are all princes ever since of paternal and regal power sir robert filmers great position is that men are not naturally free this is the foundation on which his absolute monarchy stands and from which it erects itself to an height that its power is above every power caput inter nubilia so high above all earthly and human things that thought can scarce reach it that promises and oaths which tie the infinite deity cannot confine it but if this foundation fails all his fabric falls with it and governments must be left again to the old way of being made by contrivance and the consent of men anqrwp",

      "sij making use of their reason to unite together into society to prove this grand position of his he tells us p men are born in subjection to their parents and therefore cannot be free and this authority of parents he calls royal authority p fatherly authority right of fatherhood p one would have thought he would in the beginning of such a work as this on which was to depend the authority of princes and the obedience of subjects have told us expressly what that fatherly authority is have definer it though not limited it because in some other treatises of his he tells us it is unlimited and unlimitable he should at least have given us such an account of it that we might have had an entire notion of this fatherhood or fatherly authority whenever it came in our way in his writings this i expected to have found in the first chapter of his patriarchal but instead thereof having en passant made his obeisance to the arcana imperii p made his compliment to the rights and liberties of this or any other nation p which he is going presently to null and destroy and made his leg to those learned men who did not see so far into the matter as himself p he comes to fall on bellarmine p and by a victory over him estab lishes his fatherly authority beyond any question bellarmine being routed by his own confession p the day is clear got and there is no more need of any forces for having done that i observe not that he states the question or rallies up any arguments to make good his opinion but rather tells us the story as he thinks fit of this strange kind of domineering phantom called the fatherhood which whoever could catch presently got empire and unlimited absolute power he acquaints us how this fatherhood liege in adam continued its course and kept the world in order all the time of the patriarchs till the flood got out of the ark with noah and his sons made and supported all the kings of the earth till the captivity of the israelites in egypt and then the poor fatherhood was under hatches till god by giving the israelites kings reestablished the ancient and prime right of the lineal succession in paternal government this is his business from p to and then obviating au objection and clearing a difficulty or two with onehalf reason p to confirm the natural right of regal power he ends the first chapter i hope it is no injury to call an half quotation an half reason for god says honour thy father and mother but our author contents himself with half leaves out thy mother quite as little serviceable to his purpose but of that more in another place i do not think our author so little skilled in the way of writing discourses of this nature nor so careless of the point in hand that he by oversight commits the fault that he himself in his anarchy of a mixed monarchy p objects to mr hunton in these words where first i charge the a that he hath not given us any definition or description of monarchy in general for by the rules of method he should have first defined and by the like rule of method sir robert should have told us what his fatherhood or fatherly authority is before he had told us in whom it w as to be found and talked so much of it but perhaps sir robert found that this fatherly authority this power of fathers and of kings for he makes them both the same p would make a very odd and frightful figure and very disagreeing with what either children imagine of their parents or subjects of their kings if he should have given us the whole draught together in that gigantic form he had painted it in his own fancy and therefore like a wary physician when he would have his patient swallow some harsh or corrosive liquor he mingles it with a large quantity of that which may dilute it that the scattered parts may go down with less feeling and cause less aversion let us then endeavour to find what account he gives us of this fatherly authority as it lies scattered in the several parts of his writings and first as it was vested in adam he says not only adam but the succeeding patriarchs had by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children p this lordship which adam by command had over the wholes world and by right descending from him the patriarchs did enjoy was as large and ample as the absolute dominion of any monarch which hath been since the creation p dominion of life and death making war and concluding peace p adam and the patriarchs had absolute power of life and death p kings in the right of parents succeed to the exercise of supreme jurisdiction p as kingly power is by the law of god so it hath no inferior law to limit it adam was lord of all p the father of a family governs by no other law than by his own will p the superiority of princes is above laws p the unlimited jurisdiction of kings is so amply described by samuel p kings are above the laws p and to this purpose see a great deal more which our a delivers in bodins words it is certain that all laws privileges and grants of princes have no force but during their life if they be not ratified by the express consent or by sufferance of the prince following especially privileges o p the reason why laws have been also made by kings was this when kings were either busied with wars or distracted with public cares so that every private man could not have access to their persons to learn their wills and pleasure then were laws of necessity invented that so every particular subject might find his princes pleasure deciphered unto him in the tables of his laws p in a monarchy the lying must by necessity be above the laws p a perfect kingdom is that wherein the king rules all things according to his own will p neither common nor statute laws are or can be any diminution of that general power which kings have over their peon pie by right of fatherhood p adam was the father king and lord over his family a son a subject and a servant or slave were one and the same thing at first the father had power to dispose or sell his children or servants whence we find that in the first reckoning up of goods in scripture the manservant and the maidservant are numbered among the possessions and substance of the owner as other goods were o pref god also hath given to the father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other whence we find the sale and gift of children to have been much in use in the beginning of the world when men had their servants for a possession and an inheritance as well as other goods whereupon we find the power of castrating and making eunuchs much in use in old times o p law is nothing else but the will of him that hath the power of the supreme father o p it was gods ordinance that the supremacy should be unlimited in adam and as large as all the acts of his will and as in him so in all others that have supreme power o p i have been fain to trouble my reader with these several quotations in our as own words that in them might be seen his own description of his fatherly authority as it lies scattered up and down in his writings which he supposes was first vested in adam and by right belongs to all princes ever since this fatherly authority there or right of fatherhood in our as sense is a divine unalterable right of sovereignty whereby a father or a prince hath an absolute arbitrary unlimited and unlimitable power over the lives liberties and estates of his children and subjects so that he may take or alienate their estates sell castrate or use their persons as he pleases they being all his slaves and he lord or proprietor of every thing and his unbounded will their law our a having placed such a mighty power in adam and upon that supposition founded all government and all power of princes it is reasonable to expect that he should have proved this with arguments clear and evident suitable to the weightiness of the cause that since men had nothing else left them they might in slavery have such undeniable proofs of its necessity that their consciences might be convinced and oblige them to submit peaceably to that absolute dominion which their governors had a right to exercise over them without this what good could our a do or pretend to do by erecting such an unlimited power but flatter the natural vanity and ambition of men too apt of itself to grow and increase with the possession of any power and by persuading those who by the consent of their fellowmen are advanced to great but limited degrees of it that by that part which is given them they have a right to all that was not so and therefore may do what they please because they have authority to do more than others and so tempt them to do what is neither for their own nor the good of those under their care whereby great mischief cannot but follow the sovereignty of adam being that on which as a sure basis our a builds his mighty absolute monarchy i expected that in his patriarcha this his main supposition would have been proved and established with all that evidence of arguments that such a fundamental tenet required and that this which the great stress of the business depends would have been made out with reasons sufficient to justify the confidence with which it was assumed but in all that treatise i could find very little tending that way the thing is there so taken for granted without proof that i could scarce believe myself when upon attentive reading that treatise i found there so mighty a structure raised upon the bare supposition of this foundation for it is scarce credible that in a discourse where he pretends to confute the erroneous principle of mans natural freedom he should do it by a bare supposition of adams authority without offering any proof for that authority indeed he confidently says that adam had royal authority p and absolute lordship and dominion of life and death p an universal monarchy p absolute power of life and death p he is very frequent in such assertions but what is strange in all his whole patriarcha i find not one presence of a reason to establish this his great foundation of government not any thing that looks like an argument but these words to confirm this natural right of regal power we find in the decalogue that the law which enjoins obedience to kings is delivered ill the terms honour thy father as if all power were originally in the father and why may i not add as well that in the decalogue the law that enjoins obedience to queens is delivered in the terms of honour thy mother as if all power were originally in the mother the argument as sir robert puts it will hold as well for one as the other but of this more in its due place all that i take notice of here is that this is all our a says in this first or any of the following chapters to prove the absolute power of adam which is his great principle and yet as if he had there settled it upon sure demonstration he begins his second chapter with these words by conferring these proofs and reasons drawn from the authority of the scripture where those proofs and reasons for adams sovereignty are bating that of honour thy father abovementioned i confess i cannot find unless what he says p in these words we have an evident confession viz of bellarmine that creation made man prince of his posterity must be taken for proofs and reasons drawn from scripture or for any sort of proof at all though from thence by a new way of inference in the words immediately following he concludes the royal authority of adam sufficiently settled in him if he has in that chapter or any where in the whole treatise given any other proofs of adams royal authority other than by often repeating it which among some men goes for argument i desire any body for him to show me the place and page that i may be convinced of my mistake and acknowledge my oversight if no such arguments are to be found i beseech those men who have so much cried up this book to consider whether they do not give the world cause to suspect that it is not the force of reason and argument that makes them for absolute monarchy but some other by interest and therefore are resolved to applaud any author that writes in favour of this doctrine whether he support it with reason or no but i hope they do not expect that rational and indifferent men should be brought over to their opinion because this their great doctor of it in a discourse made on purpose to set up the absolute monarchical power of adam in opposition to the natural freedom of mankind has said so little to prove it from whence it is rather naturally to be concluded that there is little to be said but that i might omit no care to inform myself in our authors full sense i consulted his observations on aristotle hobbes c to see whether in disputing with others he made use of any arguments for this his darling tenet of adams sovereignty since in his treatise of the natural power of kings he hath been so sparing of them in his observations on mr hobbess leviathan i think he has put in short all those arguments for it together which in his writings i find him any where to make use of his words are these if god created only adam and of a piece of him made the woman and if by generation from them two as parts of them all mankind be propagated if also god gave to adam not only the dominion over the woman and the children that should issue from them but also over all the earth to subdue it and over all the creatures on it so that as long as adam lived no man could claim or enjoy any thing but by donation assignation or permission from him i wonder c obs here we have the sum of all his arguments for adams sovereignty and against natural freedom which i find up and down in his other treatises and they are these following god s creation of adam the dominion he gave him over eve an the dominion he had as father over his children all which i shall particularly consider of adams title to sovereignty by creation sir robert in his preface to his observations on aristotles politics tells us a natural freedom of mankind cannot be supposed without the denial of the creation of adam but how adams being created which was nothing but his receiving a being immediately from omnipotency and the hand of god gave adam a sovereignty over any thing i cannot see nor consequently understand how a supposition of natural freedom is a denial of adams creation and would be glad any body else since our a did not vouchsafe us the favour would make it out for him for i find no difficulty to suppose the freedom of mankind though i have always believed the creation of adam he was created or began to exist by gods immediate power without the intervention of parents or the preexistence of any of the same species to beget him when it pleased god he should and so did the lion the king of beasts before him by the same creating power of god and if bare existence by that power and in that way will give dominion without any more ado our a by this argument will make the hon have as good a title to it as he and certainly the ancienter no for adam had his title by the appointment of god says our a in another place then bare creation gave him not dominion and one might have supposed mankind free without the denying the creation of adam since it was gods appointment made him monarch but let us see how he puts his creation and this appointment together by the appointment of god says sir robert as soon as adam was created he was monarch of the world though he had no subjects for though there could not be actual government till there were subjects yet by the right of nature it was due to adam to be governor of his posterity though not in act yet at least in habit adam was a king from his creation i wish he had told us here what he meant by gods appointment for whatsoever providence orders or the law of nature directs or positive revelation declares may be said to be by god s appointment but i suppose it cannot be meant here in the first sense ie by providence because that would be to say no more but that as soon as adam was created he was de facto monarch because by right of nature it was due to adam to be governor of his posterity but he could not de facto be by providence constituted the governor of the world at a time when there was actually no government no subjects to be governed which our a here confesses monarch of the world is also differently used by our a for sometimes he means by it a proprietor of all the world exclusive of the rest of mankind and thus he does in the same page of his preface before cited adam says he being commanded to multiply and people the earth and subdue it and having dominion given him over all creatures was thereby the monarch of the whole world none of his posterity had any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him let us understand then by monarch proprietor of the world and by appointment gods actual donation and revealed positive grant made to adam gen i as we see sir robert himself does in this parallel place and then his argument wills tend thus by the positive grant of god as soon as adam was created he was proprietor of the world because by the right of nature it was due to adam to be governor of his posterity in which way of arguing there are two manifest falsehoods first it is false that god made that grant to adam as soon as he was created since though it stands in the text immediately after his creation yet it is plain it could not be spoken to adam till after eve was made and brought to him and how then could he be monarch by appointment as soon as created especially since he calls if i mistake not that which god says to eve gen iii the original grant of government which not being till after the fall when adam was somewhat at least in time and very much distant in condition from his creation i cannot see how our a can say in this sense that by gods appointment as soon as adam was created he was monarch of the world secondly were it true that gods actual donation appointed adam monarch of the world as soon as he was created yet the reason here given for it would not prove it but it would always be a false inference that god by a positive donation appointed adam monarch of the world because by right of nature it was due to adam to be governor of his posterity for having given him the right of government by nature there was no need of a positive donation at least it will never be a proof of such a donation on the other side the matter will not be much mended if we understand by gods appointment the law of nature though it be a pretty harsh expression for it in this place and by monarch of the world sovereign ruler of mankind for then the sentence under consideration must run thus by the law of nature as soon as adam was created he was governor of mankind for by right of nature it divas due to adam to be governor of his posterity which amounts to this he was governor by right of nature because he was governor by right of nature but supposing we should grant that a man is by nature governor of his children adam could not hereby be monarch as soon as created for this right of nature being founded in his being their father how adam could have a natural right to be governor before he was a father men by being a father only he had that right is methinks hard to conceive unless he would have him to be a father before he was a father and have a title before he had it to this foreseen objection our a answers very logically he was governor in habit and not in act a very pretty way of being a governor without government a father without children and a king without subjects and thus sir robert was an author before he writ his book not in act it is true but in habit for when he had once published it it was due to him by the right of nature to be an author as much as it was to adam to be governor of his children when he had begot them and if to be such a monarch of the world an absolute monarch in habit but not in act will serve the turn i should not much envy it to any of sir roberts friends that he thought fit graciously to bestow it upon though even this of act and habit if it signified any thing but our as skill in distinctions be not to his purpose in this place for the question is not here about adams actual exercise of government but actually having a title to be governor government says our a was due to adam by the right of nature what is this right of nature a right fathers have over their children by begetting them generatione jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos says our a out of grotius de j b p l c s the right then follows the begetting as arising from it so that according to this way of reasoning or distinguishing of our a adam as soon as he was created had a title only in habit and not in act which in plain english is he had actually no title at all to speak less learnedly and more intelligibly one may say of adam he was in a possibility of being governor since it was possible he might beget children laid thereby acquire that right of nature be it what it will to govern them that accrues from thence but what connexion has this with adams creation to make him say that as soon as he was created he was monarch of the world for it may as well be said of noah that as soon as he was born he was monarch of the world since he was in possibility which in our as sense is enough to make a monarch a monarch in habit to outlive all mankind but his own posterity what such necessary connexion there is betwixt adams creation and his right to government so that a natural freedom of mankind cannot be supposed without the denial of the creation of adam i confess for my part i do not see nor how those words by the appointment c obs however explained can be put together to make any tolerable sense at least to establish this position with which they end viz adam was a king from his creation a king says our author not in act but in habit ie actually no king at all i fear i have tired my readers patience by dwelling longer on this passage than the weightiness of any argument in it seems to require but i have unavoidably been engaged in it by our authors way of writing who huddling several suppositions together and that in doubtful and general terms makes such a medley and confusion that it is impossible to show his mistakes without examining the several senses wherein his words may be taken and without seeing how in any of these various meanings they will consist together and have any truth in then for in this present passage before us how can any one argue against this position of his that adam was a king from his creation unless one examine whether the words from his creation be to be taken as they may for the time of the commencement of his government as the fore going words import as soon as he was created he was monarch or for the cause of it as he says p creation made man prince of his posterity how farther can one judge of the truth of his being thus king till one has examined whether king be to be taken as the words in the beginning of this passage would persuade on supposition of his private dominion which was lay gods positive grant monarch of the world by appointment or king on supposition of lies fatherly power over his offspring which was by nature due by the right of nature whether i say king be to be taken in both or one only of these two senses or in neither of then but only this that creation made him prince in a way different from both the other for though this assertion that adam was king from his creation be true in no sense yet it stands here as an evident conclusion drawn from the preceding words though in truth it be but a bare assertion joined to other assertions of the same kind which confidently put together in words of undetermined and dubious meaning look like a sort of arguing when there is indeed neither proof nor connexion a way very familiar with our author of which having given the reader a taste here i shall as much as the argument will permit me avoid touching on hereafter and should not have done it here were it not to let the world see how incoherences in matter and suppositions without proofs put handsomely together in good words and a plausible style are apt to pass for strong reason and good sense till they come to be looked into with attention of adams title to sovereignty by donation gen i having at last got through the foregoing passage where we have been so long detained not by the force of arguments and opposition but by the intricacy of the words and the doubtfulness of the meaning let us go on to his next argument for adams sovereignty our author tells us in the words of mr selden that adam by donation from god gen i was made the general lord of all things not without such a private dominion to himself as without his grant did exclude his children this determination of mr selden says our author is consonant to the history of the bible and natural reason obs and in his pref to his observations on aristotle he says thus the first government in the world was monarchical in the father of all flesh adam being commanded to multiply and people the earth and to subdue it and having dominion given him over all creatures was thereby the monarch of the whole world none of his posterity had any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him the earth saith the psalmist hath he given to the children of men which shows the title comes from fatherhood before i examine this argument and the text on which it is founded it is necessary to desire the reader to observe that our author according to his usual method begins in one sense and concludes in another he begins here with adams propriety or private dominion by donation and his conclusion is which shows the title comes from fatherhood but let us see the argument the words of the text are these and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth gen i from whence our author concludes that adam having here dominion given him over all creatures was thereby the monarch of the whole world whereby must be meant that either this grant of god gave adam property or as our author calls it private dominion over the earth and all inferior or irrational creatures and so consequently that he was thereby monarch or dly that it gave him rule and dominion over all earthly creatures whatsoever and thereby over his children and so he was monarch for as mr selden has properly worded it adam was made general lord of all things one may very clearly understand him that he means nothing to be granted to adam here but property and therefore he says not one word of adams monarchy but our author says adam was hereby monarch of the world which properly speaking signifies sovereign ruler of all the men in the world and so adam by this grant must be constituted such a ruler if our author means otherwise he might with much clearness have said that adam was hereby proprietor of the whole world but he begs your pardon in that point clear distinct speaking not serving every where to his purpose you must not expect it in him as in mr selden or other such writers in opposition therefore to our authors doctrine that adam was monarch of the whole world founded on this place i shall show that by this grant gen i god gave no immediate power to adam over men over his children over those of his own species and so he was not made ruler or monarch by this charter that by this grant god gave him not private dominion over the inferior creatures but right in common with all mankind so neither was he monarch upon the account of the property here given him that this donation gen i gave adam no power over men will appear if we consider the words of it for since all positive grants convey no more than the express words they are made in will carry let us see which of them here will comprehend mankind or adams posterity and those i imagine if any must be these every living thing that moveth the words in hebrew are h ie bestiam reptantem of which words the scripture itself is the best interpreter god having created the fishes and fowls the th day the beginning of the th he creates the irrational inhabitants of the dry land which ver are described in these words let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thins and beasts of the earth after his kind and ver and god made the beasts of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth on the earth after his kind here in the creation of the brute inhabitants of the earth he first speaks of them all under one general name of living creatures and then afterwards divides them into three ranks cattle or such creatures as were or might be tame and so be the private possession of particular men g which ver in our bible is translated beasts and by the septuagint qhr",
      "a wild beasts and is the same word that here in our text ver where we have this great charter to adam is translated living thing and is also the same word used gen ix where this grant is renewed to noah and there likewise translated beast the third rank were the creeping animals which ver are comprised under the word the same that is used here ver and is translated moving but in the former verses creeping and by the septuagint in all these places pet or reptiles from whence it appears that the words which we translate here in gods donation ver living creatures moving are the same which in the history of the creation ver signify two ranks of terrestrial creatures viz wild beasts and reptiles and are so understood by the septuagint when god had made the irrational animals of the world divided into three kinds from the places of their habitation viz fishes of the sea fowls of the air and living creatures of the earth and these again into cattle wild beasts and reptiles he considers of making man and the dominion he should have over the terrestrial world ver and then he reckons up the inhabitants of these three kingdoms but in the terrestrial leaves out the second rank h or wild beasts but here ver where he actually exercises this design and gives him this dominion the text mentions the fishes of the sea and fowls of the air and the terrestrial creatures in the words that signify the wild beasts and reptiles though translated living thing that moveth leaving out cattle in both which places though the word that signifies wild beasts be omitted in one and that which signifies cattle in the other yet since god certainly executed in one lilacs what he declares he designed in the other we cannot but understand the same in both places and have here only an account how the terrestrial irrational animals which were already created and reckoned up at their creation in three distinct ranks of cattle wild beasts and reptiles were here ver actually put under the dominion of man as they were designed ver nor do these words contain in them the least appearance of any thing that can be wrested to signify gods giving to one man dominion over another to adam over his posterity and this further appears front gen ix where god renewing this charter to noah and his sons he gives them dominion over the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea and the terrestrial creatures expressed by h wild beasts and reptiles the same words that in the text before us gen i are translated every moving thing that moveth on the earth which by no means can comprehend man the grant being made to noah and his sons all the men then living and not to one part of men over another which is yet more evident from the very next words ver where god gives every every moving thing the very words used ch i to them for food by all which it is plain that gods donation to adam ch i and his designation ver and his grant again to noah and his sons refer to and contain in them neither more nor less than the works of the creation the fifth day and the beginning of the sixth as they are set down from the both to th ver inclusively of the st ch and so comprehend all the species of irrational animals of the terraqueous globe though all the words whereby they are expressed in the history of their creation are nowhere used in any of the following grants but some of them omitted in one and some in another from whence i think it is past all doubt that man can not be comprehended in this grant nor any dominion over those of his own species be conveyed to adam all the terrestrial irrational creatures are enumerated at their creation ver under the names beasts of the earth cattle and creeping things but man being not then created was not contained under any of those names and therefore whether we understand the hebrew words right or no they cannot be supposed to comprehend man in the very same history and the very next verses following especially since that hebrew word which if any in this donation to adam ch i must comprehend man is so plainly used in contradistinction to him as gen vi vii gen viii and if god made all mankind slaves to adam and his heirs by giving adam dominion over every living thing that moveth on the earth ch i as our author would have it methinks sir robert should leave carried his monarchical power one step higher and satisfied the world that princes might eat their subjects too since god gave as full power to noah and his heirs ch ix to eat every living thing that moveth as he did to adam to have dominion over them the hebrew word in both places being the same david who might be supposed to understand the donation of god in this text and the right of kings too as well as our author in his comment on this place as the learned and judicious ainsworth calls it in the th psalm finds here no such charter of monarchical power his words are thou hast made him ie man the son of man a little lower than the angels thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen and the beasts of the field and fowls of the air and fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea in which words if any one can find out that there is meant any monarchical power of one man over another but only the dominion of the whole species of mankind over the inferior species of creatures he may for aught i know deserve to be one of sir roberts monarchs in habit for the rareness of the discovery and by this time i hope it is evident that he that gave dominion over every hying thing that moveth on the earth gave adam no monarchical power over those of his own species which will yet appear more fully in the next thing i am to show whatever god gave by the words of this grant gen i it was not to adam in particular exclusive of all other men whatever dominion he had thereby it was not a private dominion but a dominion in common with the rest of mankind that this donation was not made in particular to adam appears evidently from the words of the text it being made to more than one for it was spoken in the plural number god blessed them and said unto them have dominion god says unto adam and eve have dominion thereby says our author adam was monarch of the world but the grant being to them ie spoken to eve also as many interpreters think with reason that these words were not spoken till adam had his wife must not she thereby be lady as well as he lord of the world if it be said that eve was subjected to adam it seems she was not so subjected to him as to hinder her dominion over the creatures or property in them for shall we say that god ever made a joint grant to two and one only was to have the benefit of it but perhaps it will be said eve was not made till afterward grant it so what advantage will our author get by it the text will be only the more directly against him and show that god in this donation gave the world to mankind in common and not to adam in particular the word them in the text must include the species of man for it is certain them can by no means signify adam alone in the th verse where god declares his intention to give this dominion it is plain he meant that he would make a species of creatures that should have dominion over the other species of this terrestrial globe the words are and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish c they then were to have dominion who even those who were to have the image of god the individuals of that species of man that he was going to make for that them should signify adam singly of the rest that should be in the world with him is against both scripture and all reason and it cannot possibly be made sense if man in the former part of the verse do not signify the same with them in the latter only man there as is usual is taken for the species and them the individuals of that species and we leave a reason in the very text god makes him in his own image after his own likeness makes him an intellectual creature and so capable of dominion for wherein soever else the image of god consisted the intellectual nature was certainly a part of it and belonged to the whole species and enabled them to have dominion over the inferior creatures and therefore david says in the th psalm above cited thou hast made him little longer than the angels thou hast made him to have dominion it is not of adam king david speaks here for verse it is plain it is of man and the son of man of the species of mankind and that this grant spoken to adam was made to him and the whole species of man is clear from our authors own proof out of the psalmist the earth saith the psalmist hath he given to the children of men which shows the title comes from fatherhood these are sir roberts words in the preface before cited and a strange inference it is he makes god hath given the earth to the children of men ergo the title comes from fatherhood it is pity the propriety of the hebrew tongue had not used fathers of men instead of children of men to express mankind then indeed our author might have had the countenance of talc socials of the words to have placed the title in the fatherhood but to conclude that the fatherhood lead the right to the earth because god gave it to the children of men is a way of arguing peculiar to our author and a man must have a great mind to go contrary to the sound as well as sense of the words before he could light on it but the sense is yet harder and more remote from our authors purpose for as it stands in his preface it is to prove adams being monarch and his reasoning is thus god gave the partly to the children of men ergo adam was monarch of the world i defy any man try make a more pleasant conclusion than this which cannot be excused from the most obvious absurdity till it can be shown that by children of men he who had no father adam alone is signified but whatever our author does the scripture speaks not nonsense to maintain this property and private dominion of adam our author labours in the following page to destroy the community granted to noah and his sons in that parallel place gen ix and he endeavours to do it two ways sir robert would persuade us against the express words of the scripture that what was here granted to noah was not granted to his sons in common with him his words are as for the general community between noah and his sons which mr selden will have to be granted to them gen ix the text cloth not warrant it what warrant our author would have when the plain express words of scripture not capable of another meaning will not satisfy him who pretends to build wholly on scripture is not easy to imagine the text says god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them ie as our author would have it unto him for saith he although the sons are there unmentioned with noah in the blessing yet it may best be understood with a subordination or benediction m succession o that indeed is best for our author to be understood which best serves to his purpose but that truly may best be understood by any body else which best agrees with the plain construction of the words and arises from the obvious meaning of the place and then with subordination and in succession will not be lest understood in a grant of god where he himself put them not nor mentions any such limitation but yet our author has reasons why it may best he understood so the blessing says he in the following words might truly be fulfilled if the sons either under or after their father enjoyed a private dominion o that is to say that a grant whose express words give a joint title in present for the text says into your hands they are delivered may best be understood with a subordination or in succession because it is possible that in subordination in succession it may be enjoyed which is all one as to say that a grant of any thing in present possession may best be understood of reversion because it is possible one may live to enjoy it in reversion if the grant be indeed to a father and to his sons after him who is so kind as to let his children enjoy it presently in common with him one may truly say as to the event one will be as good as the other but it can never be true that what the express words grant in possession and in common may best be understood to be in reversion the sum of all his reasoning amounts to this god did not give to the sons of noah the world in common with their father because it was possible they might enjoy it under or after him a very good sort of argument against an express text of scripture but god must not be believed though he speaks it himself when he says he does any thing which will not consist with sir roberts hypothesis for it is plain however he would exclude them that part of this benediction as he would have it in succession must needs be meant to the sons and not to noah himself at all be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth says god in this blessing this part of the benedic tion as appears by the sequel concerned not noah himself at all for we read not of any children he had after the flood and in the following chapter where his posterity is reckoned up there is no mention of any and so this benediction in succession was not to take place till years after and to save our authors imaginary monarchy the peopling of the world must be deferred years for this part of the benediction cannot be understood with subordination unless our author will say that they must ask leave of their father noah to lie with their wives but in this one point our author is constant to himself in all his discourses he takes care there should be monarchs in the world but very little that there should be people and indeed his way of government is not the way to people the world for how much absolute monarchy helps to fulfil this great and primary blessing of god almighty be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth which contains in it the improvement too of arts and sciences and the conveniencies of life may be seen in those large and rich countries which are happy under the turkish government where are not now to be found onethird nay in many if not most parts of them onethirtieth perhaps i might say not onehundredth of the people that were formerly as will easily appear to any one who will compare the accounts we have of it at this time with ancient history but this by the by the other parts of this benediction or grant are so expressed that they must needs be understood to belong equally to them all as much to noahs sons as to noah himself and not to his sons with a subordination or in succession the fear of you and the dread of you says god shall be upon every beast c will any body but our author say that the creatures feared and stood in awe of noah only and not of his sons without his leave or till after his death and the following words into your hands they are delivered are they to be understood as our author says if your father please or they shall be delivered into your hands hereafter if this be to argue from scripture i know not what may not be proved by it and i can scarce see how much this dithers from that fiction and fancy or how much a surer foundation it will prove than the opinions of philosophers and poets which our author so much condemns in his preface but our author goes on to prove that it may best be understood with a subordination or a benediction in succession for says he it is not probable that the private dominion which god gave to adam and by his donation assignation or cession to his children was abro gated and a community of all things instituted between noah and his sonsnoah was left the sole heir of the world why should it be thought that god would disinherit him of his birth right and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children o the prejudices of our own illgrounded opinions however by us called probable cannot authorize us to understand scripture contrary to the direct and plain meaning of the words i grant it is not probable that adams private dominion was here abrogated because it is more than improbable for it will never be proved that adam had any such private dominion and since parallel places of scripture are most probable to make us know how they may be best understood there needs but the comparing this blessing here to noah and his sons after the flood with that to adam after the creation gen i to assure any one that god gave adam no such private dominion it is probable i confess that noah should have the same title the same property and dominion after the flood that adam had before it but since private dominion cannot consist with the blessing and grant god gave to him and his sons in common it is a sufficient reason to conclude that adam had none especially since in the donation made to him there are no words that express it or do in the least favour it and then let my reader judge whether it may best be understood when in the one place there is not one word for it not to say what has been above proved that the test itself proves the contrary and in the other the words and sense are directly against it but our author says noah was the sole heir of the world why should it be thought that god would disinherit him of his birth right heir indeed in england signifies the eldest son who is by the law of england to have all his fathers land but where god ever appointed any such heir of the world our author would have done well to have showed us and how god disinherited him of his birth right or what harm was done him if god gave his sons a right to make use of a part of the earth for support of themselves and families when the whole was not only more than noah himself but infinitely more than they all could make use of and the possessions of one could not at all prejudice or as to any use straiten that of the other our author probably foreseeing he might not be very successful in persuading people out of their senses and say what he could men would be apt to believe the plain words of scripture and think as they say that the grant was spoken to noah and his sons jointly he endeavours to insinuate as if this grant to noah conveyed no property no dominion because subduing the earth and dominion over the creatures are therein omitted nor the earth once named and therefore says he there is a considerable difference between these two texts the first blessing gave adam a dominion over the earth and all creatures the latter allows noah liberty to use the living creatures for food here is no alteration or diminishing of his title to a property of all things but an enlargement only of his commons o so that in our authors sense all that was said here to noah and his sons gave them no dominion no property but only enlarged the commons their commons i should say since god says to you are they given though our author says his for as to noahs sons they it seems by sir roberts appointment during their fathers lifetime were to keep fastingdays any one but our author would be mightily suspected to be blinded with prejudice that in all this blessing to noah and his sons could see nothing but only an enlargement of commons for as to dominion which our author thinks omitted the fear of you and the dread of you says god shall be upon every beast which i suppose expresses the dominion or superiority was designed man over the living creatures as fully as may be for in that fear and dread seems chiefly to consist what was given to adam over the inferior animals who as absolute a monarch as he was could not make bold with a lark or rabbit to satisfy his hunger and had the herbs but in common with the besets as is plain from gen i and in the next place it is manifest that in this blessing to noah and his sons property is not only given in clear words but in a larger extent than it was to adam into your hands they are given says god to noah and his sons which words if they give not property nay property in possession it will be hard to find words that can since there is not a way to express a mans being possessed of any thing more natural nor more certain than to say it is delivered into his hands and ver to show that they had then given them the utmost property man is capable of which is to have a right to destroy any thing by using it every moving thing that liveth saith god shall be meat for you which was not allowed to adam in his charter this our author calls a liberty of using them for food and also an enlargement of commons but no alteration of property o what other property man can have in the creatures but the liberty of using them is hard to be understood so that if the first blessing as our author says gave adam dominion over the creatures and the blessing to noah and his sons gave them such a liberty to use them as adam had not it must needs give them something that adam with all his sovereignty wanted something that one would be apt to take for a greater property for certainly he has no absolute dominion over even the brutal part of the creatures and the property he has in them is very narrow and scanty who cannot make that use of them which is permitted to another should any one who is absolute lord of a country have bidden our author subdue the earth and given him dominion over the creatures in it but not have permitted him to have taken a kid or a lamb out of the flock to satisfy his hunger i guess he would scarce leave thought himself lord or proprietor of that land or the cattle on it but would have found the difference between having dominion which a shepherd may have and having full property as an owner so that had it been his own case sir robert i believe would have thought here was an alteration nay an enlarging of property and that noah and his children had by this grant not only property given them but such a property given them in the creatures as adam had not for however in respect of one another slice may lo allowed to have propriety in their distinct portions of the creatures yet in respect of god the maker of heaven and earth who is sole lord and proprietor of the whole world mans propriety in the creatures is nothing but that liberty to use them which god has permitted and so mans property may be altered and enlarged as we see it here after the flood when other uses of them are allowed which before were not from all which i suppose it is clear that neither adam nor noah had any private dominion any property in the creatures exclusive of his posterity as they should successively grow up into need of them and come to be able to make use of them thus we have examined our authors argument for adams monarchy founded on the blessing pronounced gen i wherein i think it is impossible for any sober reader to find any other but the setting of mankind above the other kinds of creatures in this habitable earth of ours it is nothing but the giving to man the whole species of man as the chief inhabitant who is the image of his maker the dominion over the other creatures this lies so obvious in the plain words that any one but our author would have thought it necessary to have shown how these words that seemed to say the quite contrary gave adam monarchical absolute power over other men or the sole property in all the creatures and methinks in a business of this moment and that whereon he builds all that follows he should have done something more than barely cite words which apparently make against him for i confess i cannot see any thing in them tending to adams monarchy or private dominion but quite the contrary and i the less deplore the dulness of my apprehension herein since i find the apostle seems to have as little notion of any such private dominion of adam as i when he says god gives us all things richly to enjoy which he could not do if it were all given away already to monarch adam and the monarchs his heirs and successors to conclude this text is so far from proving adam sole proprietor that on the contrary it is a confirmation of the original community of all things amongst the sons of men which appearing from this donation of god as well as other places of scripture the sovereignty of adam built upon his private dominion must fall not haying any foundation to support it but yet if after all any one will needs have it so that by this donation of god adam was made sole proprietor of the whole earth what will this be to his sovereignty and how will it appear that propriety in land gives a man power over the life of another or how will the possession even of the whole earth give any one a sovereign arbitrary authority over the persons of men the most specious thing to be said is that he that is proprietor of the whole world may deny all the rest of mankind food and so at his pleasure starve them if they will not acknowledge his sovereignty and obey his will if this were true it would be a good argument to prove that there never was any such property that god never gave any such private dominion since it is more reasonable to think that god who bid mankind increase and multiply should rather himself give them all a right to make use of the food and raiment and other conveniencies of life the materials whereof he had so plentifully provided for them than to make them depend upon the will of a man for their subsistence who should have power to destroy them all when he pleased and who being no better than other men was in succession likelier by want and the dependence of a scanty fortune to tie them to hard service than by liberal allowance of the conveniencies of life to promote the great design of god increase and multiply he that doubts this let him look into the absolute monarchies of the world and see what becomes of the conveniencies of life and the multitudes of people but we know god hath not left one man so to the mercy of another that he may starve him if he please god the lord and father of all has given no one of his children such a property in his peculiar portion of the things of this world but that he has given his needy brother a right to the surplusage of his goods so that it cannot justly be denied him when his pressing wants call for it and therefore no man could ever have a just power over the life of another by right of property in land or possessions since it would always be a sin in any man of estate to let his brother perish for want of affording him relief out of his plenty as justice gives every man a title to the product of his honest industry and the fair acquisitions of his ancestors descended to him so charity gives every man a title to so much out of anothers plenty as will keep him from extreme want where he has no means to subsist otherwise and a man can no mare justly make use of anothers necessity to force him to become his vassal by withholding that relief god requires him to afford to the wants of his brother than he that has more strength can seize upon a weaker master him to his obedience and with a dagger at his throat offer him death or slavery should any one make so perverse an use of gods blessings poured on him with a liberal hand should any one be cruel and uncharitable to that extremity yet all this would not prove that propriety ill land even in this case gave any authority over the persons of men but only that compact might since the authority of the rich proprietor and the subjections of the needy beggar began not from the possession of the lord but the consent of the poor man who preferred being his subject to starving and the man he thus submits to can pretend to no more power over him than he has consented to upon compact upon this ground a mans having his stores filled in a time of scarcity having money in his pocket being in a vessel at sea being able to swim c may as well be the foundation of rule and dominion as being possessor of all the land in the world any of these being sufficient to enable me to save a mans life who would perish if such assistance were denied him and any thing by this rule that may be an occasion of working upon anothers necessity to sale his life or any thing dear to him at the of his freedom may be made a foundation of sovereignty as well as property from all which it is clear that though god should have given adam private dominion yet that private dominion could give him no sovereignty but we have already sufficiently proved that god gave him no private dominion of adams title to sovereignty by the subjection of eve the next place of scripture we find our author builds his monarchy of adam on is gen iii and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee here we have says he the original grant of government from whence he concludes in the following part of the page o that the supreme power is settled in the fatherhood and limited to one kind of government that is to monarchy for let his premises be what they will this is always the conclusion let rule in any text be but once named and presently absolute monarchy is by divine right established if any one will but carefully read our authors own reasoning from these words o and consider among other things the line and posterity of adam as he there brings them in he will find some difficulty to make sense of what he says but we will allow this at present to his peculiar way of writing and consider the force of the text in hand the words are the curse of god upon the woman for having been the first and forwardest in the disobedience and if we will consider the occasion of what god says here to our first parents that he was denouncing judgment and declaring his wrath against them both for their disobedience we cannot suppose that this was the time wherein god was granting adam prerogatives and privileges investing him with dignity and authority elevating him to dominion and monarchy for though as a holster in the temptation live was laid below him and so he had accidentally a superiority over her for her greater punishment yet he too had his share in the fall as well as the sin and was laid lower as may be seen in the following verses and it would be hard to imagine that gall in the same breath should make him universal monarch over all mankind and a daylabourer for his life turn lain out of paradise to till the ground ver and at the same time advance him to a throne and all the privileges and case of absolute power this was not a time when adam could expect any favours any grant of privileges from his offended maker if this be the original grant of government as our author tells us and adam was now made monarch whatever sir robert would have him it is plain god made him but a very poor monarch such an one as our author himself would have counted it no great privilege to be god sets him to work for his living and seems rather to give him a spade into his hand to subdue the earth than a sceptre to rule over its inhabitants in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread says god to him ver this was unavoidable may it perhaps be answered because he was yet without subjects and had nobody to work for him but afterwards living as he did above years he might have people enough whom he might command to work for him no says god not only whilst thou art without other help save thy wife but as long as thou livest shalt thou live by thy labour in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it west thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return ver it will perhaps be answered again in favour of our author that these words are not spoken personally to adam but in him as their representative to all mankind this being a curse upon mankind because of the fall god i believe speaks differently from men because he speaks with more truth more certainty but when he vouchsafes to speak to men l do not think he speaks differently from them in crossing the rules of language in use amongst them this would not be to condescend to their capacities when he humbles himself to speak to them but to lose his design in speaking what thus spoken they could not understand and fact thus must we think of god if the interpretations of scripture necessary to maintain our authors doctrine must be received for good for by the ordinary rules of language it will be very hard to understand what god says if what he speckles here in the singular number to adam must be understood to be spoken to all mankind and what he says in the plural number gen i and must be understood of adam alone exclusive of all others and what he says to noah and his sons jointly must be understood to be meant to noah alone gen ix farther it is to be noted that these words here of gen iii which our author calls the original grant of government were not spoken to adam neither indeed was there any grant in them snide to adam but a punishment laid upon eve and if we will take them as they were directed in particular to her or in her as their representative to all other women they will at most concern the female sex only and im port no more but that subjection they should ordinarily be in to their husbands but there is here no more law to oblige a woman to such subjection if the circumstances either of her condition or contract with her husband should exempt her from it than there is that she should bring forth her children in sorrow and pain if there could be found a remedy for itwhich is also a part of the same curse upon her for the whole verse runs thus unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee it would i think have been a hard matter for any body but our author to have found out a grant of monarchical government to adam in these words which were neither spoken to nor of him neither will any one i suppose by these words think the weaker sex as by a law so subjected to the curse contained in them that it is their duty not to endeavour to avoid it find will any one say that eve or any other woman sinned if she were brought to bed without those multiplied pains god threatens her here with or that either of our queens mary or elizabeth had they married any of their subjects had been by this text put into a political subjection to him or that he should thereby have had monarchical rule over her god in this text gives note that i see any authority to adam over eve or to men over their wives but only foretell what should be the womans lot how by his providence he would order it so that she should be subject to her husband as we see that generally the laws of mankind and customs of nations leave ordered it so and there is i grant a foundation in nature for it thus when god says of jacob and esau that the elder should serve the younger gen xxv nobody supposes that god hereby made jacob esaus sovereign but foretold what should de facto come to pass but if these words here spoken to eve must needs be understood as a law to bind her and all other women to subjection it can be no other subjection than what every wife owes her husband and then if this be the original grant of government and the foundation of monarchical power there will be as many monarchs as there are husbands if therefore these words give any power to adam it can be only a conjugal power not political the power that every husband hath to order the things of private concernment in his family as proprietor of the goods and land there and to have his will take place before that of his wife in all things of their common concernment but not a political power of life and death over her much less over any body else this i am sure if our author will have this text to be a grant the original grant of government political government he ought to have proved it by some better arguments than by barely saying that thy desire shall be unto thy husband was a law whereby eve and all that should come of her were subjected to the absolute monarchical power of adam and his heirs thy desire shall be to thy husband is too doubtful an expression of whose signification interpreters are not agreed to build so confidently on and in a matter of such moment and so great and general concernment but our author according to his way of writing having once named the text concludes presently without any more ado that the meaning is as he would have it let the words rule and subject be but found in the text or margin and it immediately signifies the duty of a subject to his prince the relation is changed and though god says husband sir robert will have it king adam has presently absolute monarchical power over eve and not only over love but all that should come of her though the scripture says not a word of it nor our author a word to prove it but adam must for all that be an absolute monarch and so down to the end of the chapter and here i leave my reader to consider whether my bare saying without offering any reasons to evince it that this text gave not adam that absolute monarchical power our author supposes be not as sufficient to destroy that power as his bare assertion is to establish it since the text mentions neither prince nor people speckles nothing of absolute or monarchical power but the subjection of eve to adam a wife to her husband and he that would trace our author so all through would make a short and sufficient answer to the greatest part of the grounds he proceeds on and abundantly confute them by barely denying it being a sufficient answer to assertions without proof to deny them without giving a reason and therefore should i have said nothing but barely denied that by this text the supreme power was settled and founded by god himself in the fatherhood limited to monarchy and that to adams person and heirs all which our author notably concludes from these words as may be seen in the same page o it had been a sufficient answer should i have desired any sober man only to have read the text and considered to whom and on what occasion it was spoken he would no doubt have wondered how our author found out monarchical absolute power in it had he not had an exceeding good faculty to find it himself where he could not show it others and thus we have examined the two places of scripture all that i remember our author brings to prove adams sovereignty that supremacy which he says it was gods ordinance should be unlimited in adam and as large as all the acts of his will o viz gen i and gen iii one whereof signifies only the subjection of the inferior ranks of creatures to mankind and the other the subjection that is due from a wife to her husband both far enough from that which subjects owe the governors of political societies i of adams title to sovereignty by fatherhood there is one thing more and then i think i have given you all that our author brings for proof of adams sovereignty and that is a supposition of a natural right of dominion over his children by being their father and this title of fatherhood he is so pleased with that you will find it brought in almost in every page particularly he says not only adam but the succeeding patriarchs had by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children p and in the same page this subjection of children being the fountain of all regal authority c this being as one would think by his so frequent mentioning it the main basis of all his frame we may well expect clear and evident reason for it since he lays it down as a position necessary to his purpose that every man that is born is so far from being free that by his very birth he becomes a subject of him that begets him o so that adam being the only man created and all ever since being begotten nobody has been born free if we ask how adam comes by this power over his children he tells us here it is lay begetting them and so again o this natural dominion of adam says he may be proved out of grotius himself who teacheth that generations jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos and indeed the act of begetting being that which makes a man a father his right of a father over his children can naturally arise from nothing else grotius tells us lot here how far this jus in liberos this power of parents over their children extends but our author always very clear in the point assures us it is supreme power and like that of absolute monarchs over their slaves absolute power of life and death he that should demand of him how or for what reason it is that begetting a child gives the father such an absolute power over him will find him answer nothing we are to take his word for this as well as several other things and by that the laws of nature and the constitutions of government must stand or fall had he been an absolute monarch this way of talking might have suited well enough pro ratione voluntas might have been of force in his mouth but in the way of proof or argument is very unbecoming and will little advantage his plea for absolute monarchy sir robert has too much lessened a subjects authority to leave himself the hopes of establishing any thing by his bare saying it one slaves opinion without proof is not of weight enough to dispose of the liberty and fortunes of all mankind if all men are not as i think they are naturally equal i am sure all slaves are and then i may without presumption oppose my single opinion to his and be confident that my saying that begetting of children makes them not slaves to their fathers as certainly sets all mankind free as his affirming the contrary makes them all slaves but that this position which is the foundation of all their doctrine who would have monarchy to be jure divino may have all fair play let us hear what reasons others give for it since our author offers none the argument i leave heard others make use of to prove that fathers by begetting them come by an absolute power over their children is this that fathers have a power over the lives of their children because they give them life and being which is the only proof it is capable of since there can be no reason why naturally one man should have any claim or presence of right over that in another which was never his which he bestowed not but was received from the bounty of another i answer that every one who gives another any thing has not always thereby a right to take it away again but they who say the father gives life to children are so dazzled with the thoughts of monarchy that they do not as they ought remember god who is the author and giver of life it is in him alone we live move and have our being how can he be thought to give life to another that knows not wherein his own life consists philosophers are at a loss about it after their most diligent inquiries and anatomists after their whole lives and studies spent in dissections and diligent examining the bodies of men confess their ignorance in the structure and use of many parts of mans body and in that operation wherein life consists in the whole and doth the rude ploughman or the more ignorant voluptuary frame or fashion such an admirable engine as this is and then put life and sense into it can any man say he formed the parts that are necessary to the life of his child or can he suppose himself to give the life and yet not know what subject is fit to receive it nor what actions or organs are necessary for its reception or preservation to give life to that which has yet no being is to frame and make a living creature fashion the parts and mould and suit them to their uses and having proportioned and fitted them together to put into them a hying soul he that could do this might indeed have some presence to destroy his own workmanship but is there any one so bold that dares thus far arrogate to himself the incomprehensible works of the almighty who alone did at first and continues still to make a living soul he alone can breathe in the greatly of life if any one thinks himself an artist at this let lain number up the parts of his childs body will he hath made tell me their uses and operations and when the living and rational soul began to inhabit this curious structure when sense began and how this engine which he has framed thinks and reasons if he made it let him when it is out of order mend it at least tell wherein the defects lie shall he that made the eye not see says the psalmist psalm xciv see these mens vanities the structure of that one part is sufficient to convince us of an allwise contriver and he has so visible a claim to us as his workmanship that one of the ordinary appellations of god in scripture is god our maker and the lord our maker and therefore though our author for the magnifying his fatherhood be pleased to say o that even the power which god himself exerciseth over mankind is by right of fatherhood yet this fatherhood is such an one as utterly excludes all presence of title in earthly parents for he is king because he is indeed maker of us all which no parents can pretend to be of their children but had men skill and power to make their children it is not so slight a piece of workmanship that it can be imagined they could make them without designing it what father of a thousand when he begets a child thinks farther than the satisfying his prey sent appetite god in his infinite wisdom has put strong desires of copulation into the constitution of men thereby to continue the race of mankind which he doth most commonly without the intention and often against the consent and will of the begetter and indeed those who desire and design children are but the occasions of their being and when they design and wish to beget them do little more towards their making than deucalion and his wife in the fable did towards the making of mankind by throwing pebbles over their heads but grant that the parents made their children gave them life and being and that hence there followed an absolute power this would give the father but a joint dominion with the mother over them for nobody can deny but that the woman lath an equal share if not the greater as nourishing the child a long time in her own body out of her own substance there it is fashioned and from her it receives the materials and principles of its constitution and it is so hard to imagine the rational soul should presently inhabit the yet unformed embryo as soon as the father has done his part in the act of generation that if it must be supposed to derive any thing from the parents it must certainly owe most to the mother but be that as it will the mother cannot be denied an equal share in begetting of the child nod so the absolute authority of the father will not arise from hence our author indeed is of another mind for he says we know that god at the creation gave the sovereignty to the man over the woman as being the nobler and principal agent in generation o i remember not this in my bible and when the place is brought where god at the creation gave the sovereignty to man over the woman and that for this reason because he is the nobler and principal agent in generation it will be time enough to consider and answer it but it is no new thing for our author to tell us his own fancies for certain and divine truths though there be often a great deal of difference between his and divine revelations for god in the scripture says his father and his mother that begot him they who allege the practice of mankind for exposing or selling their children as a proof of their power over them are with sir robert happy arguers and cannot but recommend their opinion by founding it on the most shameful action and most unnatural murder human nature is capable of the dens of lions and nurseries of wolves know no such cruelty as this these savage inhabitants of the desert obey god and nature in being tender and careful of their offspring they will hunt watch fight and almost starve for the preservation of their young never part with them never forsake them till they are able to shift for themselves and is it the privilege of man alone to act more contrary to nature than the wild and most untamed part of the creation doth god forbid us under the severest penalty that of death to take away the life of any man a stranger and upon provocation and does he permit us to destroy those he has given us the charge and care of and by the dictates of nature and reason as well as his revealed command requires us to preserve he has in all the parts of creation taken a peculiar care to propagate and continue the several species of creatures anal makes the individuals act so strongly to this end that they sometimes neglect their own private good for it and seem to forget that general rule which nature teaches all things of selfpreservation and the preservation of their young as the strongest principle in them overrules the constitution of their particular natures thus we see when their young stand in need of it the timorous become valiant the fierce and savage kind and the ravenous tender and liberal but if the example of what hath been done be the rule of what ought to be history would have furnished our author with instances of this absolute fatherly power in its height and perfection and he might have showed us in peru people that begot children on purpose to fatten and eat them the story is so remarkable that i cannot but set it down in the authors words in some provinces says he they were so liquorish after mans flesh that they would not have the patience to stay till the breath was out of the body but would suck the blood as it ran from the wounds of the dying man they had public shambles of mans flesh and their madness herein was to that degree that they spared not their own children which they had begot on strangers taken in war for they made their captives their mistresses and choicely nourished the children they lead by them till about thirteen years old they butchered and eat them and they served the mothers after the same fashion when they grew past childbearing and ceased to bring them any more roasters garcilasso de la vega hist des yncas de peru i c thus far can the busy mind of man carry him to a brutality below the level of beasts when he quits his reason which places him almost equal to angels nor can it be otherwise in a creature whose thoughts are more than the sands and wider than the ocean where fancy and passion must needs run him into strange courses if reason which is his only star and compass be not that he steers by the imagination is always restless and suggests variety of thoughts and the will reason being laid afield is ready for every extravagant project and in this state he that goes farthest out of the way is thought fittest to lead and is sure of most followers and when fashion hath once established what folly or craft began custom makes it sacred and it will be thought impudence or madness to contradict or question it he that will impartially survey the nations of the world will find so much of their religions governments and manners brought in and continued amongst them by these means that he will have but little reverence for the practices which are in use and credit amongst men and will have reason to think that the woods and forests where the irrational untaught inhabitants keep right by following nature are fitter to give us rules than cities and palaces where those that call themselves civil and rational go out of their way by the authority of example if precedents are sufficient to establish a rule in this case our author might have found in holy writ children sacrificed by their parents and this amongst the people of god themselves the psalmist tells us psalm cvi they shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan but god judged not of this by our authors rule nor allowed of the authority of practice against his righteous law but as it follows there the land was polluted with blood therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance the killing of their children though it were fashionable was charged on them as innocent blood and so had in the account of god the guilt of murder as the offering them to idols had the guilt of idolatry be it then as sir robert says that anciently it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children o let it be that they exposed them add to it if you please for this is still greater power that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them if this proves a right to do so we may by the same argument justify adultery incest and sodomy for there are examples of these too both ancient and modern sins which i suppose have their principal aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriagebed as necessary hereunto in confirmation of this natural authority of the father our author brings a lame proof from the positive command of god in scripture his words are to confirm the natural right of regal power we find in the decalogue that the law which enjoins obedience to kings is delivered in the terms honour thy father p whereas many confess that government only in the abstract is the ordinance of god they are not able to prove any such ordinance in the scripture but only in the fatherly power and therefore we find the commandment that enjoins obedience to superiors given in the terms honour thy father so that not only the power and right of government but the form of the power governing and the person having the power are all the ordinances of god the first father had not only simply power but power monarchical as he was father immediately from god o to the same purpose the same law is cited lay our author in several other places and just after the same fashion that is and mother as apocryphal words are always left out a great argument of our authors ingenuity and the goodness of his cause which required in its defender zeal to a degree of warmth able to warp the sacred rule of the word of god to make it comply with his present occasion a way of proceeding not unusual to those who embrace not truths because reason and revelation offer them but espouse tenets and parties for ends deferent from truth and then resolve at any rate to defend then and so do with the words and sense of authors they would fit to their purpose just as procrustes did with his guests lop or stretch them as clay best fit them to the size of their notions and they always prove like those so served deformed lame and useless for had our author set down this command without garbling as god gave it and joined another to father every reader would have seen that it had made directly against him and that it was so far from establishing the monarchical power of the father that it set up the mother equal with him and enjoined zing but was due in common to both father and mother for that is the constant tenour of the scripture honour thy father and thy another exod xx he that smiteth his father or mother shall surely be put to death xx he that curseth his father or mother shall surely be put to death ver repeated lev xx and by our saviour matth xv ye shall fear every man his mother and his father lev xix if any man have a rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother then shall his father and his mother lay hold an him and say this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice deut xxi cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother xxvii my son hear the instructions of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother are the words of solomon a king who was not ignorant of what belonged to him as a father or a king and yet he joins father and mother together in all the instructions he gives children quite through his book of proverbs woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou brought forth isa xiv in thee have they set light by father and mother ezeli xxii and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him thou shalt not live and his father anti his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth zech xiii here not the father only but the father and mother jointly had power in this case of life and death thus ran the law of the old testament and in the new they are likewise joined in the obedience of their children eph vi the rule is children obey your parents and do not remember that i any where read children obey your father and no more the scripture joins mother too in that homage which is due from children and had there been any text where the honour or obedience of children had been directed to the father alone it is not likely that our author who pretends to build all upon scripture would have omitted it nay the scripture makes the authority of father and mother in respect of those they have begot so equal that in some places it neglects even the priority of order which is thought due to the father and the mother is put first as lev xix a from which so constantly joining father and mother together as is found quite through scripture we may conclude that the honour they have a title to from their children is one common right belonging so equally to them both that neither can claim it wholly neither can be excluded one would wonder then how our author infers from the fifth commandment that all power was originally in the father how he finds monarchical power of government settled and fixed by the commandment honour thy father and thy mother if all the honour due by the commandment be it what it will be the only right of the father because he as our author says has the sovereignty over the woman as being the nobler and principal agent in generation why did god afterwards all along join the mother with him to share in his honour can the father by this sovereignty of his discharge the child front paying this honour to his mother the scripture gave no such licence to the jews anal yet there were often breaches wide enough betwixt husband and wife even to divorce and separation and i think nobody will say a child may withhold honour from his mother or as the scripture terms it set light by her though his father should command him to do so no more than the mother could dispense with him for neglecting to honour his father whereby it is plain that this command of god gives the father no sovereignty no supremacy i agree with our author that the title to this honour is vested in the parents by nature and is a right which accrues to them by their having begotten their children and god by many positive declarations has confirmed it to them i also allow our authors rule that in grants and gifts that have their original from god and nature as the power of the father let me add and mother for whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder no inferior power of men can limit nor make any law of prescription against them o so that the mother having by this law of god a right to honour from her children which is not subject to the will of her husband we see this absolute monarchical popover of the father can neither be founded on it nor consist with it and he has a power very far from monarchical very far from that absoluteness our author contends for when another has over his subjects the same power he hath and by the same title and therefore he cannot forbear saying himself that he cannot see how any mans children can be free from subjection to their parents p which in common speech i think signifies mother as well as father or if parents here signifies only father it is the first time i ever yet knew it to do so and by such an use of words one may say any thing by our authors doctrine the father having absolute jurisdiction over his children has also the same over their issue and the consequence is good were it true that the father had such a power and yet i ask our author whether the grandfather by his sovereignty could discharge the grandchild from paying to his father the honour due to him by the fifth commandment if the grandfather hath by right of fatherhood sole sovereign power in him and that obedience which is due to the supreme magistrate he commanded in these words honour thy father it is certain the grandfather might dispense with the grandsons honouring his father which since it is evident in common sense he cannot it follows from hence that honour thy father and mother cannot mean an absolute subjection to a sovereign power but something else belie right therefore which parents have by nature and which is confirmed to them by the fifth commandment cannot be that political dominion which our author would derive from it for that being in every civil society supreme somewhere can discharge any subject from any political obedience to any one of his fellowsubjects but what law of the magistrate can give a child liberty not to honour his father and mother it is an eternal law annexed purely to the relation of parents and children and so contains nothing of the magistrates power in it nor is subjected to it our author says god hath given to a father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other o i doubt whether he can alien wholly the right of honour that is due from them but be that as it will this i am sure he cannot alien and retain the same power if therefore the magistrates sovereignty be as our author would have it nothing but the authority of a supreme father p it is unavoidable that if the magistrate hath all this paternal right as he must have if fatherhood be the fountain of all authority then the subjects though fathers can have no power over their children no right to honour from them for it cannot be all in anothers hands and a part remain with the parents so that according to our authors own doctrine honour thy father and mother cannot possibly be understood of political subjec tion and obedience since the laws both in the old and new testament that commanded children to honour and obey their parents were given to such whose fathers were under civil government and fellowsubjects with them in political societies and to have bid them honour and obey their parents in our authors sense had been to bid them be subjects to those who had no title to it the right to obedience from subjects being all vested in another and instead of teaching obedience this had been to foment sedition by setting up powers that were not if therefore this command honour thy father and mother concern political dominion it directly overthrows our authors monarchy since it being to be paid by every child to his father even in society every father must necessarily have political dominion and there will be as many sovereigns as there are fathers besides that the mother too hath her title which destroys the sovereignty of one supreme monarch but if honour thy father and mother mean something distinct from political power as necessarily it must it is besides our authors business and serves nothing to his purpose the law that enjoins obedience to kings is delivered says our author in the terms honour thy father as if all power were originally in the father o and that law is also delivered say i in the term honour thy mother as if all power were originally in the mother i appeal whether the argument be not as good on one side as the other father and mother being joined all along in the old and new testament wherever honour or obedience is enjoined children again our author tells us o that this command honour thy father gives the right to govern anal makes the form of government monarchical to which i answer that if by honour thy father be meant obedience to the political power of the magistrate it concerns not any duty we owe to our natural fathers who are subjects because they by our authors doctrine are divested of all that power it being placed wholly in the prince and so being equally subjects and slaves with their children can have no light by that title to any such honour or obedience is contains in it political subjection if honour thy father and mother signifies the duty we owe our natural parents as by our saviours interpretation matth xv and tall the other mentioned places it is plain it does then it cannot concern political obedience but a duty that it owing to persons who have no title to sovereignty nor any political authority as magistrates ever subjects for the person of a private father and a title to obedience due ho the supreme magistrate are things inconsistent and therefore this command which must necessarily comprehend the persons of natural fathers must mean a duty we owe them distinct from our obedience to the magistrate and from which the most absolute poorer of princes cannot absolve us what this duty is we shall in its due place examine and thus we have at last got through all that in our author looks like an argument for that absolute unlimited sovereignty described sect which he sup poses in adam so that mankind have ever since been all born slaves without any title to freedom but if creation which gave nothing but a being made not adam prince of his posterity if adam gen i was not constituted lord of mankind nor had a private dominion given him exclusive of his children but only a right and power over the earth and inferior creatures in common with the children of men if also gen iii god gave not any particular power to adam over his wife and children but only subjected eve to adam as a punishment or foretold the subjection of the weaker sex in the ordering the common concernments of their families but gave not thereby to adam as to the husband power of life and death which necessarily bet longs to the magistrate if fathers by begetting their children acquire no such power over them and if the command honour thy father and mother give it not but only enjoins a duty owing to parents equally whether subjects or not and to the mother as well as the father if all this be so as i think by what has been said is very evident then man has a natural freedom notwithstanding all our author confidently says to the contrary since all that share in the same common nature faculties and powers are in nature equal and ought to partake in the same common rights and privileges till the manifest appointment of god who is lord over all blessed for ever can be produced show any particular persons supremacy or a mans own consent subjects him to a superior this is so plain that our author confesses that sir john hayward blackwood and barclay the great vindicators of the right of kings could not deny it but admit with one consent the natural liberty and equality of mankind for a truth unquestionable and our author hath been so far from producing any thing that may make good his great position that adam was absolute monarch and so men are not naturally free that even his own proofs make against him so that to use his own way of arguing the first erroneous principle failing the whole fabric of this vast engine of absolute power and tyranny drops down of itself and there needs no more to be said in answer to all that he builds upon so false and frail a foundation but to save others the pains were there any need he is not sparing himself to show by his own contradictions the weakness of his own doctrine adams absolute and sole dominion is that which he is every where full of and all along builds on and yet he tells us p that as adam was lord of his children so his children under him had a command and power over their own children the unlimited and undivided sovereignty of adams fatherhood by our authors computation stood but a little while only during the first generation but as soon as he had grandchildren sir robert could give but a very ill account of it adam as father of his children saith he hath an absolute unlimited royal power over them and by virtue thereof over those that they begot and so to all generations and yet his children viz cain and seth have a paternal power over their children at the same time so that they are at the same time absolute lordsand yet vassals and slaves adam has all the authority as grandfather of the people and they have a part of it as fathers of a part of them he is absolute over them and their posterity by having begotten them and yet they are absolute over their children by the same title no says our author adams children under him had power over their own children but still with subordination to the first parent a good distinction that sounds well and it is pity it signifies nothing nor can be reconciled with our authors words i readily grant that supposing adams absolute power over his posterity any of his children might hare from him a delegated and so a subordinate power over a part or all the rest but that cannot be the power our author speaks of here it is not a power by grant and commission but the natural paternal power he supposes a father to have over his children for he says as adam was lord of his children so his children under him had a power over their own children they were then lords over their own children after the same manner and by the same title that adam was ie by right of generation by right of fatherhood it is plain he means the natural power of fathers because he limits it to be only over their own children a delegated power has no such limitation as only over their own children it might be over others is well as their own children if it were a delegated power it must appear in scripture but there is no ground in scripture to affirm that adams children had any other power over theirs than what they naturally had as fathers but that he means here paternal power and no other is past doubt from the inference he makes ill these words immediately following i see not then how the children of adam or of any man else can be free from subjection to their parents whereby it appears that the power on one side and the subjection on the other our author here speaks of is that natural power and subjection between parents and children for that which every mens children owed could be no other and that our author always affirms to be absolute and unlimited this natural power of parents over their children adam had over his posterity says our author and this power of parents over their children his children had over theirs in his lifetime says our author also so that adam by a natural right of father had an absolute unlimited power over all his posterity anal at the saline time his children had by the same right absolute unlimited power over theirs here then are two absolute unlimited powers existing together which i would love any body reconcile one to another or to common sense for the salvo he has put in of subordination makes it more absurd to have one absolute unlimited nay unlimitable power in subordination to another is so manifest a contradiction that nothing can be more adam is absolute prince with the un limited authority of fatherhood over all his posterity all his posterity are then absolutely his subjects anal as our author says his slaves children and grandchildren are equally in this state of subjection and slavery and yet says our author the children of adam have paternal ie absolute unlimited power over their own children which in plain english is they are slaves and absolute princes at the same time and in the same government and one part of the sum jects have an absolute unlimited power over the other by the natural right of parentage if any one will suppose in favour of our author that he here meant that parents who are in subjection themselves to the absolute authority of their father have yet some power over their children i confess he is something nearer the truth but he will not at all hereby help our author for he nowhere speaking of the paternal power but as an absolute unlimited authority cannot be supposed to understand any thing else here unless he himself had limited it and showed how far it reached and that he means here paternal authority in that large extent is plain from the immediately following words this subjection of children being says he the foundation of all regal authority p the subjection then that in the former line he says every man is in to his parents and consequently what adams grandchildren were in to their parents was that which was the fountain of all regal authority ie according to our author absolute unlimitable authority and thus adams children had regal authority over their children whilst they themselves were subjects to their father and fellowsubjects with their children but him mean as he pleases it is plain he allows adams children to have paternal power p as also all other fathers to have paternal power over their children o from whence one of these two things will necessarily follow that either adams children even in his life time had and so all other fathers have as he phrases it p by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children or else that adam by right of fatherhood had not royal authority for it cannot be lout that paternal power does or does not give royal authority to them that have it if it does not then adam could not be sovereign by this title nor any body else and then there is an end of all our authors politics at once if it does give royal authority then every one that has paternal power has royal authority and then by our authors patriarchal government there will be as many kings as there are fathers an i thus what a monarchy he hath set up let him and his disciples consider princes certainly will have great reason to thank him for these new politics which set up as many absolute kings in every country as there are fathers of children and yet who can blame our author for it it lying unavoidably in the way of one discoursing upon our authors principles for having placed an absolute power in fathers by right of begetting he could not easily resolve how much of this power belonged to a son over the children he had begotten and so it fell out to be a very hard matter to give all the power as he does to adam and yet allow a part in his life time to his children when they were parents and which he knew not well how to deny them this makes him so doubtful in his expressions and so uncertain where to place this absolute natural power which he calls fatherhood sometimes adam alone has it all as p o and pref sometimes parents have it which word scarce signifies the father alone p sometimes children during their fathers lifetime as p sometimes fathers of families as p sometimes fathers indefinitely o sometimes the heir to adam o sometimes the posterity of adam sometimes prime fathers all sons of grandchildren of noah o sometimes the eldest parents p sometimes all kings p sometimes all that have supreme power o sometimes heirs to those first progenitors who were at first the natural parents of the whole people p sometimes an elective king p sometimes those whether a few or a multitude that govern the commonweath p sometimes he that can catch it an usurper p o thus this new nothing that is to carry with it all power authority and government this fatherhood which is to design the person and establish the throne of monarchs whom the people are to obey may according to sir robert come into any hands any how and so by his politics give to democracy royal authority and make an usurper a lawful prince and if it will do all these fine feats much good do our author and all his followers with their omnipotent fatherhood which can serve for nothing but to unsettle and destroy all the lawful governments in the world and to establish in their room disorder tyranny and usurpation ii of fatherhood and property considered together as fountains of sovereignty in the foregoing chapters we have seen what adams monarchy was in our authors opinion and upon what titles he founded it the foundations which he lays the chief stress on as those from which he thinks he may best derive monarchical power to future princes are two viz fatherhood and property and therefore the way he proposes to remove the absurdities and inconveniencies of the doctrine of natural freedom is to maintain the natural and private dominion of adam o conformable hereunto he tell us the grounds and principles of government necessarily depend upon the original of property o the subjection of children to their parents is the fountain of all regal authority p and all power on earth is either derived or usurped from the fatherly power there being no other original to be found of any power whatsoever o i will not stand here to examine how it can be said without a contradiction that the first grounds and principles of government necessarily depend upon the original of property and yet that there is no other original of any power whatsoever but that of the father it being hard to understand how there can be no other original but fatherhood and yet that the grounds and principles of government depend upon the original of property property and fatherhood being as far different as lord of a manor and father of children nor do i see how they will either of them agree with what our author says o of gods sentence against eve gen iii that it is the original grant of government so that if that were the original government had not its original by our authors own confession either from property or fatherhood and this text which he brings as a proof of adams power over eve necessarily contradicts what he says of the fatherhood that it is the sole fountain of all power for if adam had any such regal power over eve as our author contends for it must be by some other title than that of begetting but i leave him to reconcile these contradictions as well as many others which may plentifully be found in him by any one who will but read him with a little attention and shall come now to consider how these two originals of government adams natural and private dominion will consist and serve to make out and establish the titles of succeeding monarchs who as our author obliges them must all derive their popover from these fountains let us then suppose adam made by gods donation lord and sole proprietor of the whole earth in as large and ample a manner as sir robert could wish let us suppose him also by right of fatherhood absolute ruler over his children with an unlimited supremacy i ask then upon adams death what becomes of both his natural and private domination and i doubt not it will be answered that they descended to his next heir as our author tells us in several places but this way it is plain cannot possibly convey both his natural and private dominion to the same person for should we allow that all the property all the estate of the father ought to descend to the eldest son which will need some proof to establish it and so he has by that title all the private dominion of the father yet the fathers natural dominion the paternal power cannot descend to him by inheritance for it being a right that accrues to a man only by begetting no man can have this natural dominion over any one he does not beget unless it can be supposed that a man can have a right to any thing without doing that upon which that right is solely founded for if a father by begetting and no other title has natural dominion over his children he that does not beget them cannot have this natural dominion over them and therefore be it true or false that our author says o that every man that is born by his very birth becomes a subject to him that begets him this necessarily follows viz that a man by his birth cannot become a subject to his brother who did not beget him unless it can be supposed that a man by the very same title can come to be under the natural and absolute dominion of two different men at once or it be sense to say that a man by birth is under the natural dominion of his father only because he begat him and a man by birth also is under the natural dominion of his eldest brother though he did not beget him if then the private dominion of adam ie his property in the creatures descended at his death all entirely to his eldest son his heir for if it did not there is presently an end of all sir roberts monarchy and his natural dominion the dominion a father has over his children by begetting them belonged immediately upon adams decease equally to all his sons who had children by the same title their father had it the sovereignty founded upon property and the sovereignty founded upon fatherhood come to be divided since cain as heir had that of property alone seth and the other sons that of fatherhood equally with him this is the best can be made of our authors doctrine and of the two titles of sovereignty he sets up in adam one of them will either signify nothing or if they both must stand they can serve only to confound the rights of princes and disorder government in his posterity for by building upon two titles to dominion which cannot descend together and which he allows may be separated for he yields that adams children had their distinct territories by right of private dominion o p he makes it perpetually a doubt upon his principles where the sovereignty is or to whom we owe our obedience since fatherhood and property are distinct titles and began presently upon adams death to be in distinct persons and which then was to give way to the other let us take the account of it as he himself gives it us he tells us out of grotius that adams children by donation assignation or some kind of cession before he was dead had their distinct territories by right of private dominion abel had his flocks and pastures for them cain had his fields for corn and the land of nod where he built him a city o here it is obvious to demand which of these two after adams death was sovereign cain says our author p by what title as heir for heirs to progenitors who were natural parents of their people are not only lords of their own children but also of their brethren says our author p what was cain heir to not the entire possessions not all that which adam had private dominion in for our author allows that abel by a title derived from his father had his distinct territory for pasture by right of private dominion what then abel had by private dominion was exempt from cains dominion for he could not have private dominion over that which was under the private dominion of another and therefore his sovereignty over his brother is gone with this private dominion and so there are presently two sovereigns and his imaginary title of fatherhood is out of doors and cain is no prince over his brother or else if cain retain his sovereignty over abel notwithstanding his private dominion it will follow that the first grounds and principles of government have nothing to do with property whatever our author says to the contrary it is true abel did not outlive his father adam but that makes nothing to the argument which will hold good against sir robert in abels issue or in seth or any of the posterity of adam not descended from cain the same inconvenience he runs into about the three sons of noah who as he says p had the whole world divided amongst them by their father i ask then in which of the three we shall find the establishment of regal power after noahs death if in all three as our author there seems to say then it will follow that regal power is founded in property of land and follows private dominion and not in paternal power or natural dominion and so there is an end of paternal power as the fountain of regal authority and the so much magnified fatherhood quite vanishes if the regal power descended to shem as eldest and heir to his father then noahs division of the world by lot to his sons or his ten years sailing about the mediterranean to appoint each son his part which our author tells of p was labour lost his division of the world to them was to ill or to no purpose for his grant to cham and japhet was little worth if shem notwithstanding this grant as soon as noah was dead was to be lord over them or if this grant of private dominion to them over their assigned territories were good here were set up two distinct sorts of power not subordinate one to the other with all those inconveniencies which he musters up against the power of the people o which i shall set down in his own words only changing property or people all power on earth is either derived or usurper from the fatherly power there being no other original to be found of any power whatsoever for if there should be granted two sorts of power without any subordination of one to the other they would be in perpetual strife which should be supreme for two supremes cannot agree if the fatherly power be supreme then the power grounded on private dominion must be subordinate and depend on it and if the power grounded on property be supreme then the fatherly power must submit to it and cannot be exercised without the licence of the proprietors which must quite destroy the frame and course of nature this is his own arguing against two distinct independent powers which i have set down in his own words only putting power rising from property for power of the people and when he has answered what he himself has urged here against two distinct powers we shall be better able to see how with any tolerable sense he can derive all regal authority from the natural anal private dominion of adam from fatherhood and property together which are distinct titles that do not always meet in the same persons and it is plain by his own confession presently separated as soon both as adams and noahs death makes way for succession though our author frequently in his writings jumbles them together and omits not to make use of either where he thinks it will sound best to his purpose but the absurdities of this will more fully appear in the next chapter where we shall examine the ways of coveyance of the sovereignty of adam to princes that were to reign after him iii of the conveyance of adams sovereigns monarchical power sir robert having not been very happy in any proof he brings for the sovereignty of adam is not much more fortunate in conveying it to future princes who if his politics be true must all derive their titles from that first monarch the ways he has assigned as they lie scattered up and down in his writings i will set down in his own words in his preface he tells us that adam being monarch of the whole world none of his posterity had any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him here he snakes two ways of conveyance of any thing adam stood possessed of and those are grants or succession again he says all kings either are or arc to be reputed the next heirs to those first progenitors who were at first the natural parents of the whole people p there cannot be any multitude of men whatsoever but that in it considered by itself there is one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be the king of all the rest as being the next heir to adam o here in these places inheritance is the only way he allows of conveying monarchical power to princes in other places he tells us o all power on earth is either derived or usurped from the fatherly power o all kings that now are or ever were are or were either fathers of their people or heirs of such fathers or usurpers of the right of such fathers o and here he makes inheritance or usurpation the only way whereby kings come by this original power but yet he tells us this fatherly empire as it was of itself hereditary so it was alienable by patent and seizable by an usurper o so then here inheritance grant or usurpation will convey it and last of all which is most admirable he tells us p it skills not which way kings come by their power whether by election donation succession or by any other means for it is still the manner of the government by supreme popover that makes them properly kings and not the means of obtaining their crowns which i think is a full answer to all his whole hypothesis and discourse about adams royal authority as the fountain from which all princes were to derive theirs and he might have spared the trouble of speaking so much as he does up and down of heirs and inheritance if to make any one properly a king needs no more but governing by supreme power and it matters not by what means he came by it by this notable way our author may make oliver as properly king as any one else he could think of and had he had the happiness to live under massaniellos government he could not by this his own rule have forborne to have done homage to him with o king live for ever since the manner of his government by supreme power made him properly king who was but the day before properly a fisherman and if don quixote had taught his squire to govern with supreme authority our author no doubt could have made a most loyal subject in sancho panchas island he must needs have deserved some preferment in such governments since i think he is the first politician who pretending to settle government upon its true basis renal to establish the thrones of lawful princes ever told the world that he was properly a king whose manner of government was by supreme power by what means soever he obtained it which in plain english is to say that regal and supreme power is properly and truly his who can by any means seize upon it and if this be to be properly a king i wonder how he came to think of or where he will find an usurper this is so strange a doctrine that the surprise of it hath made me pass by without their due reflection the contradictions he runs into by making sometimes inheritance alone sometimes only grant or inheritance sometimes only inheritance or usurpation sometimes all these three and at last election or any other means added to them the ways whereby adams royal authority that is his right to supreme rule could be conveyed down to future kings and governors so as to give them a title to the obedience and subjection of the people but these contradictions lie so open that the very reading of our authors own words will discover them to any ordinary understanding and though what i have quoted out of him with abundance more of the same strain and coherence which might be found in him might well excuse me from any farther treble in this argument yet having proposed to myself to examine the main parts of his doctrine i shall a little more particularly consider how inheritance grant usurpation or election can any way make out government in the world upon his principles or derive to any one a right of empire froin this regal authority of adam had it been ever so well proved that he had been absolute monarch and lord of the whole world of monarchy by inheritance from adam though it be ever so plain that there ought to be government in the world nay should all men be of our authors mind that divine appointment had ordained it to be monarchical yet since men cannot obey any thing that cannot command and ideas of government in the fancy though ever so perfect though ever so right cannot give laws nor prescribe rules to the actions of men it would be of no behoof for the settling of order and establishment of government in its exercise and use amongst men unless there were a way also taught how to know the person to whom it belonged to have this power and exercise this dominion over others it is in vain then to talk of subjection and obedience without telling us whom we are to obey for were i ever so fully persuaded that there ought to be magistracy and rule in the world yet i am nevertheless at liberty still till it appears who is the person that hath right to my obedience since if there be no marks to know him by and distinguish him that hath right to rule from other men it may be myself as well as any other and therefore though submission to government be every ones duty yet since that signifies nothing but submitting to the direction and laws of such men as have authority to command it is not enough to make a man a subject to convince him that there is regal power in the world but there must be ways of designing and knowing the person to whom this regal power of right belongs and a man can never be obliged in conscience to submit to any power unless he can be satisfied who is the person who has a right to exercise that power over him if this were not so there would be no distinction between pirates and lawful princes he that has force is without any more ado to be obeyed and crowns and sceptres would become the inheritance only of violence and rapine men too might as often and as innocently change their governors as they do their physicians if the person cannot be known who has a right to direct me and whose prescriptions i am bound to follow to settle therefore mens consciences under an obligation to obedience it is necessary that they know not only that there is a power somewhere in the world but the person who by right is vested with this power over them how successful our author has been in his attempts to set up a monarchical absolute power in adam the reader may judge by what has been already said but were that absolute monarchy as clear as our author would desire it as i presume it is the contrary yet it could be of no use to the government of mankind now in the world unless he also make out these two things first that this power of adam was not to end with him but was upon his decease conveyed entire to some other person and so on to posterity secondly that the princes and rulers now on earth are possessed of this power of adam by a right way of conveyance derived to them if the first of these fail the power of adam were it ever so great ever so certain will signify nothing to the present government and societies in the world but we must seek out some other original of power for the government of polities than this of adam or else there will be none at all in the world if the latter fail it will destroy the authority of the present governors and absolve the people from subjection to them since they having no better claim than others to that power which is alone the fountain of all authority can have no title to rule over them our author having fancied an absolute sovereignty in adam mentions several ways of its conveyance to princes that were to be his successors but that which he chiefly insists on is that of inheritance which occurs so often in his several discourses and i having in the foregoing chapter quoted several of these passages i shall not need here again to repeat them this sovereignty he erects as has been said upon a double foundation viz that of property and that of fatherhood one was the right he was supposed to have in all creatures a right to possess the earth with the beasts and other inferior ranks of things in it for his private use exclusive of all other men the other was the right he was supposed to have to rule and govern men all the rest of mankind in both these rights there being supposed an exclusion of all other men it must be upon some reason peculiar to adam that they must both be founded that of his property our author supposes to rise from gods immediate donation gen i and that of fatherhood from the act of begetting now in all inheritance if the heir succeed not to the reason upon which his fathers right was founded he cannot succeed to the right which followeth from it for example adam had a right of property in the creatures upon the donation and grant of god almighty who was lord and proprietor ofthem all let this be so as our author tells us yet upon his death his heir can have no title to them no such right of property in them unless the same reason viz gods donation vested a right in the heir too for if adam could have had no property in nor use of the creatures without this positive donation from god and this donation were only personally to adam his heir could have no right by it but upon his death it must revert to god the lord and owner again for positive grants give no title farther than the express words convey it and by which only it is held and thus if as our author himself contends that donation gen i were made only to adam personally his heir could not succeed to his property in the creatures and if it were a donation to any but adam let it be shown that it was to his heir in our authors sense ie to one of his children exclusive of all the rest but not to follow our author too far out of the way the plain of the case is this god having made man and planted in him as in all other animals a strong desire of selfpreservation and furnished the world with things fit for food and raiment and other necessaries of life subservient to his design that man should live and abide for some time upon the face of the earth and not that so curious and wonderful a piece of workmanship by his own negligence or want of necessaries should perish again presently after a few moments continuance god i say having made man and the world thus spoke to him that is directed him by his senses and reason as he did the inferior animals by their sense and instinct which were serviceable for his subsistence and given him as the means of his preservation and therefore i could not but before these words were pronounced gen i if they must be understood literally to have been spoken and without any such verbal donation man had a right to an use of the creatures by the will and grant of god for the desire strong desire of preserving his life and being having been planted in him as a principle of action by god himself reason which was the voice of god in him could not but teach him and assure him that pursuing that natural inclination he had to preserve his being he followed the will of his maker and therefore had a right to make use of those creatures which by his rear son or senses he could discover would be serviceable thereunto and thus mans property in the creatures was founded upon the right he had to make use of those things that were necessary or useful to his being this being the reason and foundation of adams property gave the same title on the same ground to all his children not only after his death but in his life time so that here was no privilege of his heir above his other children which could exclude them from an equal right to the use of the inferior creatures for the comfortable preservation of their beings which is all the property man hath in them and so adams sovereignty built on property or as our author calls it private dominion comes to nothing every man had a right to the creatures by the same title adam had viz by the right every one had to take care of and provide for their subsistence and thus men had a right in common adams children in common with him but if any one lead begun and made himself a property in any particular thing which how he or any one else could do shall be shown in another place that thing that possession if he disposed not otherwise of it by his positive grant descended naturally to his children and they had a right to succeed to it and possess it it might reasonably be asked here how cone children by this right of possessing before any other the properties of their parents upon their decease for it being personally the parents when they die without actually transferring their right to another why does it not return again to the common stock of mankind it perhaps be answered that common consent hath disposed of it totheir children common practice we see indeed does so dispose of it but we cannot say that it is the common consent of mankind for that hath never been asked nor actually given and it common tacit consent hath established it it would make but a positive and not a natural right of children to inherit the goods of their parents but where the practice is universal it is reason able to think the cause is natural the ground then i think to be this the first and strongest desire god planted in men and wrought into the very principles of their nature being that of selfpreservation that is the foundation of a right to the creatures for the particular support and use of each individual person himself but next to this god planted in men a strong desire also of propagating their kind and continuing themselves in their posterity and this gives children a title to share in the property of their parents and a right to inherit their possessions men are not proprietors of what they have merely for themselves their children have a title to part of it and have their kind of right joined with their parents in the possession which comes to be wholly theirs when death having put an end to their parents use of it hath taken them from their possessions and this eve call inheritance men being by a like obligation bound to preserve what they have begotten as to preserve themselves their issue come to have a right in the goods they are possessed of that children have such a right is plain from the laws of god and that men arc convinced that children have surly a right is evident from the law of the land both which laws require parents to provide for their children for children being by the course of nature born weak and unable to provide for themselves they have by the appointment of god himself who hath thus ordered the course of nature a right to be nourished and maintained by their parents nay a right not only to a bare subsistence but to the convenicncics and comforts of life as far as the conditions of their parents can afford it hence it comes that when their parents leave the world and so the care due to their children ceases the effects of it are to extend as far as possibly they can and the provisions they have made in their lifetime are understood to be intendecl as nature requires they should for their children whom after themselves they are bound to provide for though the dying parents by express words declare nothing about them nature appoints the descent of their property to their children who thus come to have a title and natural right of inheritance to their fathers goods which the rest of mankind cannot pretend to were it not for this right of being nourished and maintained by their parents which god and nature has given to children and obliged parents to as a duty it would be reasonable that the father should inherit the estate of his son and be preferred in the inheritance before his grandchild for to the grandfather there is due a long score of care and expenses laid out upon the breeding and education of his son which one would think in justice ought to be paid but that haying teen done in obedience to the same law whereby he received nourishment and education from his own parents this score of education received from a mans father is paid by taking care and providing for his own children is paid i say as much as is required of payment by alteration of property unless present necessity of the parents require a return of goods for their necessary support and subsistence for we are not now speaking of that reverence acknowledgment respect and honour that is always due from children to their parents but of possessions and commodities of life valuable by money but though it be incumbent on parents to bring up and provide for their children yet this debt to their children does not quite cancel the score to their parents but only is made by nature preferable to it for the debt a man owes his father takes place and gives the father a right to inherit the sons goods where for want of issue the right of issue doth not exclude that title and therefore a man having a right to be maintained by his children where he needs it and to enjoy also the comforts of life from them when the necessary provision due to them end their children will afford it if his son die without issue the father has a right in nature to possess his goods and inherit his estate whatever the municipal laws of some countries may absurdly direct otherwise and so again his children and their issue from him or for want of such his father and his issue but where no such are to be found ie no kindred there we see the possessions of a private man revert to the community and so in politic societies come into the hands of the public magistrate but in the state of nature become again perfectly common nobody having a right to inherit them nor can any one have a property in them otherwise than in any other things common by nature of which i shall speak in its due place i have been the larger in showing upon what ground children have a right to succeedto the possession of their fathers properties not only because by it it will appear that if addend had a property a titular insignificant useless property for it could be no better for he was bound to nourish and maintain his children and posterity out of it in the whole earth and its product yet all his children coming to have by the law of nature and right of inheritance a joint title and a right of property in it after his death it could convey no right of sovereignty to any one of his posterity over the rest since every one having a right of inheritance to his portion they might enjoy their inheritance or any part of it in common or share it or some parts of it by division as it best liked them but no one could pretend to the whole inheritance or any sovereignty supposed to accompany it since a right of inheritance gave every one of the rest as well as any one a title to share in the goods of his father not only upon this account i say have i been so particular in examining the reason of childrens inheriting the property of their fathers but also because it will give us farther light in the inheritance of rule and power which in countries where their particular municipal laws give the whole possession of land entirely to the firstborn and descent of power has gone so to men by this custom that some have been apt to be deceived into an opinion that there was a natural or divine right of primogeniture to both estate and power and that the inheritance of both rule over men and property in things sprang from the same original and were to descend by the same rules property whose original is from the right a man has to use any of the inferior creatures for the subsistence and comfort of his life is for the benefit and sole advantage of the proprietor so that he may even destroy the thing that he has property in by his use of it where need requires but government being for the preservation of every mans right and property by preserving him from the violence or injury of others is for the good of the governed for the magistrates sword being for a terror to evil doers and by that terror to enforce men to observe the positive laws of the society made conformable to the laws of nature for the public good ie the good of every particular member of that society as far as by common rules it can be provided for the sword is not given the magistrate for his own good alone children therefore as has been showed by the dependence they have on their parents for subsistence have a right of inheritance to their fathers property as that which belongs to them for their proper good and behoof and therefore are fitly termed goods wherein the firstborn has not a sole or peculiar right by any law of god and nature the younger children having an equal title with him founded on that right they all have to maintenance support and comfort from their parents and on nothing else but government being for the benefit of the governed and not the sole advantage of the governors but only for theirs with the rest as they make a part of that politic body each of whose parts and members are taken care of and directed in its peculiar functions for the good of the whole by the laws of society cannot be inherited by the same title that children have to the goods of their father the right a son has to be maintained and provided with the necessaries and conveniencies of life out of his fathers stock gives him a right to succeed to his fathers property for his own good but this can give him no right to succeed also to the rule which his father had over other men all that a child has right to claim from his father is nourishment and education and the things nature furnishes for the support of life but he has no right to demand rule or dominion from him he can subsist and receive from him the portion of good things and advantages of education naturally due to him without empire and dominion that if his father hath any was vested in him for the good and behoof of others and therefore the son cannot claim or inherit it by a title which is founded wholly on his own private good and advantage we must know low the first ruler from whom any one claims came by his authority upon what ground any one has empire what his title is to it before we can know who has a right to succeed him in it and inherit it from him if the agreement and consent of men first gave a sceptre into any ones hand or put a crown on his head that also must direct its descent and conveyance for the same authority that made the first a lawful ruler must make the second too and so give right of succession in this case inheritance or primogeniture can in itself have no right no presence to it any farther than that consent which established the form of the government hath so settled the succession and thus we see the succession of crowns in several countries places it on different heads and he comes by right of succession to be a prince in one place who would be a subject in another if god by his positive grant and revealed declaration first gave rule and dominion to any man he that will claim by that title must have the same positive grant of god for his succession for if that has not directed the course of its descent and conveyance clown to others nobody can succeed to this title of the first ruler children have no right of inheritance to this and primogeniture can lay no claim to it unless god the author of this constitution hath so ordained it thus we see the pretensions of sauls family who received his crown from the immediate appointment of god ended with his reign and david by the same title that saul reigned viz gods appointment succeeded in his throne to the exclusion of jonathan and all pretensions of paternal inheritance and if solomon had a right to succeed his father it must be by some other title than that of primogeniture a cadet or sisters son must have the preference in succession if he has the same title the first lawful prince had and in dominion that has its foundation only in the positive appointment of god himself benjamin the youngest must have the inheritance of the crown if god so direct as well as one of that tribe had the first possession if paternal right the act of begetting give a man rule and dominion inheritance or primogeniture can give no title for he that cannot succeed to his fathers title which was begetting cannot succeed to that power over his brethren which his father had by paternal right over them but of this i shall have occasion to say more in another place this is plain in the meantime that any government whether supposed to be at first founded in paternal right consent of the people or the positive appointment of god himself which can supersede either of the other and so begin a new government upon a new foundation i say any government began upon either of these can by right of succession come to those only who have the title of him they succeed to power founded on contract can descend only to him who has right by that contract power founded on begetting he only can have that begets and power founded on the positive grant or donation of god he only can have by right of succession to whom that grant directs it from what i have said i think this is clear that a right to the use of the creatures being founded originally in the right a man has to subsist and enjoy the conveniencies of life and the natural right children have to inherit the goods of their parents being founded in the right they have to the same subsistence and commodities of life out of the stock of their parents who are therefore taught by natural love and tenderness to provide for them as a part of themselves and all this being only for the good of the proprietor or heir it can be no reason for childrens inheriting of rule and dominion which has another original and a different end nor can primogeniture have any presence to a right of solely inheriting either property or power as we shall in its due place see more fully it is enough to have showed here that adams property or private dominion could not convey any sovereignty or rule to his heir who not having a right to inherit all his fathers possessions could not thereby come to have any sovereignty over his brethren and therefore if any sovereignty on account of his property had been vested in adam which in truth there was not yet it would have died with him as adams sovereignty if by virtue of being proprietor of the world he had any authority over men could not have been inherited by any of his children over the rest because they had the same title to divide the inheritance and every one had a right to a portion of his fathers possessions so neither could adams sovereignty by right of fatherhood if any such he had descend to any one of his children for it being in our authors account a right acquired by begetting to rule over those he had begotten it was not a power possible to be inherited because the right being consequent to and built on an act perfectly personal made that power so too and impossible to be inherited for paternal power being a natural right rising only from the relation of father and son is as impossible to be inherited as the relation itself and a man may pretend as well to inherit the conjugal power of the husband whose heir he is had over his wife as he can to inherit the paternal power a father over his children for the power of the husband being founded on contract and the power of the father on begetting he may as well inherit the power obtained by the conjugal contract which was only personal as he may the power obtained by begetting which could reach no farther than the person of the begetter unless begetting can be a title to power in him that does not beget which makes it a reasonable question to ask whether adam dying before eve his heir suppose cain or seth should have by right of inheriting adams fatherhood sovereign power over eve his mother for adams father hood being nothing but a right he had to govern his children because he begot them he that inherits adams fatherhood inherits nothing even in our authors sense but the right adam had to govern his children because he begot them so that the monarchy of the heir would not have taken in eve or if it did it being nothing but the fatherhood of adam descended by inheritance the heir must have right to govern love because adam begot her for fatherhood s nothing else perhaps it will be said with our author that a man can alien his power over his child and what may be transferred by compact may be possessed by inheritance i answer a father cannot alien the power he has over his child he may perhaps to some degrees forfeit it but cannot transfer it and if any other man acquire it it is not by the fathers grant but by some act of his own for example a father unnaturally careless of his child sells or gives him to another man and he again exposes him a third man finding him breeds him up cherishes and provides for him as his own i think in this case nobody will doubt but that the greatest part of filial duty and subjection was here owing and to be paid to this fosterfather and if any thing could be demanded from the child by either of the other it could be only due to his natural father who perhaps might have forfeited his right to much of that duty compre hended in the command honour your parents but could transfer none of it to another he that purchased and neglected the child got by his purchase and grant of the father no title to duty or honour from the child but only he acquired it who by his own authority performing the office and care of a father to the forlorn and perishing infant made himself by paternal care a title to proportionable degrees of paternal power this will be more easily admitted upon considerations of the nature of paternal power for which i refer my reader to the second book to return to the argument in hand this is evident that paternal power arising only from begetting for in that our author places it alone can neither be transferred nor inherited and he that does not beget can no more have paternal power which arises from thence than he can have a right to any thing who performs not the condition to which only it is annexed if one should ask by what law has a father power over his children it will be answered no doubt by the law of nature which gives such a power over them to him that begets them if one should ask likewise by what law does our authors heir come by a right to inherit i think it would be answered by the law of nature too for i find not that our author brings one word of scripture to prove the right of such an heir he speaks of why then the law of nature gives fathers paternal power over their children because they did beget them and the same law of nature gives the paternal power to the heir over his brethren who did not beget them whence it follows that either the father has not his paternal power by begetting or else that the heir has it not at all for it is hard to understand how the law of nature which is the law of reason can give the paternal power to the father over his children for the only reason of begetting and to the firstborn over his brethren without this only reason ie for no reason at all and if the eldest by the law of nature can inherit this paternal power without the only reason that gives a title to it so may the youngest as well as he and a stranger as well as either for where there is no reason for any one as there is not but for him that begets all have an equal title i am sure our author offers no reason and when any body does we shall see whether it will hold or no in the mean time it is as good sense to say that by the law of nature a man has right to inherit the property of another because he is of kin to him and is known to be of his bloods and therefore by the same law of nature an utter stranger to his blood has right to inherit his estate as to say that by the law of nature he that begets them has paternal power over his children and therefore by the law of nature the heir that begets them not has this paternal power over them or supposing the law of the land gave absolute power over their children to such only who nursed them and fed their children themselves could any body pretend that this law gave any one who did no such thing absolute power over those who were not his children when therefore it can be showed that conjugal power can belong to him that is not an husband it will also i believe be proved that our authors paternal power acquired by begetting may be inherited by a son and that a brother as heir to his fathers power may have paternal power over his brethren and by the same rule conjugal power too but till then i think we may rest satisfied that the paternal power of adam this sovereign authority of fatherhood were there any such could not descend to nor be inherited by his next heir fatherly power i easily grant our author if it will do him any good can never be lost because it will be as long in the world as there are fathers but none of then will have adams paternal power or derive theirs from him but every one will have his own by the same title adam had his viz by begetting but not by inheritance or succession no more than husbands have their conjugal power by inheritance from adam and thus we see as adam had no such property no such paternal power as gave him sovereign jurisdiction over mankind so likewise his sovereignty built upon either of these titles if he had any such could not have descended to his heir but must have ended with him adam therefore as has been proved being neither monarch nor his imaginary monarchy hereditable the power which is now in the world is not that which was adams since all that adam could have upon our authors grounds either of property or fatherhood necessarily cried with him and could not be conveyed to posterity by inheritance in the next place we will consider whether adam had any such heir to inherit his power as our author talks of of the heir to adams monarchical power our author tells us o that it is a truth undeniable that there cannot be any multitude of men whatsoever either great or small though gathered together from the several corners and remotest regions of the world but that in the same multitude considered by itself there is one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be king of all the rest as being the next heir to adam and all the other subjects to him every man by nature is a king or a subject and again p if adam himself were still living and now ready to die it is certain that there is one man and but one in the world who is next heir let this multitude of men be if our author pleases all the princes upon the earth there will then be by our authors rule one amongst them that in nature hath a right to be king of all the rest as being the right heir to adam an excellent way to establish the thrones of princes and settle the obedience of their subjects by setting up an hundred or perhaps a thousand titles if there be so many princes in the world against any king now reigning each as good upon our authors grounds as his who wears the crown if this right of heir carrier any weight with it if it be the ordinance of god as our author seems to tell us o must not all be subject to it from the highest to the lowest can those who wear the name of princes without having the right of being heirs to adam demand obedience from their subjects by this title and not be bound to pay it by the same law either governments in the world are not to be claimed and held by this title of adams heir and then the starting of it is to no purpose the being or not being adams heir signifies nothing as to the title of dominion or if it really be as our author says the true title to government and sovereignty the first thing to be done is to find out this true heir of adam seat him in his throne and then all the kings and princes of the world ought to come and resign up their crowns and sceptres to him as things that belong no more to them than to any of their subjects for either this right in nature of adams heir to be king over all the race of men for all together they make one multitude is a right not necessary to the making of a lawful king and so there may be lawful kings without it and then kings titles and pointer depend not on it or else all the kings in the world but one are not lawful kings and so have no right to obedience either this title of heir to adam is that whereby kings hold their crowns and have a right to subjection from their subjects and then one only can have it and the rest being subjects can require no obedience from other men w ho are but their fellowsubjects or else it is not the title whereby kings rule and have a right to obedience from their subjects and then kings are kings without it and this dream of the natural sovereignty of adams heir is of no use to obedience and government for if kings be a right to dominion and the obedience of their subjects who are not nor can possibly be heirs to adam what use is there of such a title when we are obliged to obey without it if kings who are not heirs to adam have no right to sovereignty we are all free till our author or any body for him will show us adams right heir if there be but one heir of adam there can be but one lawful king in the world and noborly in conscience can be obliged to obedience till it be resolved who that is for it may be any one who is notknown to be of a younger house and all others have equal titles if there be more than one heir of adam every one is his heir and so every one has regal power for if two sons can be heirs together then all the sons equally are heirs and so all are heirs being all sons or sons sons of adam betwixt these two the right of heir cannot stand for by it either but one only man or all men are kings take which you please it dissolves the bonds of government and obedience since if all men are heirs they can owe obedience to nobody if only one nobody can be obliged to pay obedience to him till he be known and his title made out who heir the great question which in all ages has disturbed mankind and brought on them the greatest part of those mischiefs which have ruined cities depopulated countries and disordered the peace of the world has been not whether there be power in the world nor whence it came but who should have it the settling of this point being of no smaller moment than the security of princes and the peace and welfare of their estates and kingdoms a reformer of politics one would think should lay this sure and be very clear in it for if this remain disputable all the rest will be to very little purpose and the skill used in dressing up power with all the splendor and temptation absoluteness can add to it without showing who has a right to have it will serve only to give a greater edge to mans natural ambition which of itself is but too keen what can this do but set men on the more eagerly to scramble and so lay a sure and lasting foundation of endless contention and disorder instead of that peace and tranquillity which is the blurriness of government and the end of human society this designation of the person our author is more than ordinary obliged to take care of because he affirming that the assignment of civil power is by divine institution hath made the conveyance as well as the power itself sacred so that no consideration no act or art of man can divert it from that person to whom by this divine right it is assigned no necessity or contrivance can substitute another person in his room for if the assignment of civil power be by divine institution and adams heir be he to whom it is thus assigned as in the foregoing chapter our author tells us it would be as much sacrilege for any one to be king who was not adams heir as it would have been amongst the jews for any one to have been priest who had not been of aarons posterity for not only the priesthood in general being by divine institution but the assignment of it to the sole line and posterity of aaron made it impossible to be enjoyed or exercised by any one but those persons who revere else offspring of aaron whose succession therefore was carefully observed and by that the persons who had a right to the priesthood certainly known let us see then what care our author has taken to make us know who is this heir who by divine institution leas a right to be king over all men the first account of him we meet with is p in these words this subjection of children being the fountain of all regal authority by the ordination of god himself it follows that civil power not only in general is by divine institution but even the assignment of it specifically to the eldest parents matters of such consequence as this is should be in plain words as little liable as might be to doubt or equivocation and i think if language be capable of expressing any thing distinctly and clearly that of kindred and the several degrees of nearness of blood is one it were therefore to be wished that our author had used a little more intelligible expressions here that we might have better known who it is to whom the assignment of civil power is made by divine institution or at least would have told us what he meant by eldest parents for i believe if land had been assigned or granted to him and the eldest parents of his family he would have thought it had needed an interpreter and it would scarce have been known to whom next it belonged in propriety of speech and certainly propriety of speech is necessary in a discourse of this nature eldest parents signifies either the eldest men and women that have had children or those who have longest had issue and then our authors assertion will be that those fathers and mothers who have been longest in the world or longest fruitful have by divine institution a right to civil power if there be any absurdity in this our author must answer for it and if his meaning be different from my explication he is to be blamed that he would not speak it plainly this i am sure parents cannot signify heirs male nor eldest parents an infant child who yet may sometimes be the true heir if there can be but one and we are hereby still as much at a loss who civil power belongs to notwithstanding this assignment by divine institution as if there had been no such assignment at all or our author had said nothing of it this of eldest parents leaving us more in the dark who by divine institution has a right to civil power than those who never heard any thing at all of heir or descent of which our author is so full and though the chief matter of his writing be to teach obedience to those who have a right to it which he tells us is conveyed by descent yet who those are to whom this right by descent belongs he leaves like the philosophers stone in politics out of the reach of any one to discover from his writings this obscurity cannot be imputed to want of language in so great a master of style as sir robert is when he is resolved with himself what he would say and therefore i fear finding how hard it would be to settle rules of descent by divine institution and how little it would be to his purpose or conduce to the clearing and establishing the titles of princes if such rules of descent were settled he chose rather to content himself with doubtful and general terms which might make no ill sound in mens ears who were willing to he pleased with them rather than offer any clear rules of descent of this fatherhood of adam by which mens consciences might be satisfied to whom it descended and know the persons who had a right to regal power and with it to their obedience how else is it possible that laying so much stress as he does upon descent and adams heir next heir true heir he should never tell us what heir means nor the way to know who the next or true heir is this i do not remember he does any where expressly handle but where it comes in his way very warily and doubtfully touches though it be so necessary that without it all discourses of government and obedience upon his principles would be to no purpose and fatherly power ever so well made out will be of no use to any body hence he tells us o that not only the constitution of power in general but the limitation of it to one kind ie monarchy and the determination of it to the individual person and line of adam are all three ordinances of god neither eve nor her children could either limit adams power or join others with him and what was given unto adam was given in his person to his posterity here again our author inform us that the divine ordinance hath limited the descent of aclams monarchical power to whom to adams line and posterity says our author a notable limitation a limitation to all mankind for if our author can find any one amongst mankind that is not of the line and posterity of adam he may perhaps tell him who this next heir of adam is but for us i despair how this limitation of adams empire to his line and posterity will help us to find out one heir this limitation indeed of our author will save those the labour who would look for him amongst the race of brutes if any such there were but will very little contribute to the discovery of one next heir amongst men though it make a short and easy determination of the question about the descent of adams regal power by telling us that the line and posterity of adam is to have it that is in plain english any one may have it since there is no person living that hath not the title of being of the line and posterity of adam and while it keeps there it keeps within our authors limitation by gods ordinance indeed p he tells us that such heirs are not only lords of their own children but of their brethren whereby and by the words following which we shall consider anon he seems to insinuate that the eldest son is heir but he nowhere that i know says it in direct words but by the instances of cain and jacob that there follow we may allow this to be so far his opinion concerning heirs that where there are divers children the eldest son has the right to be heir that primogeniture cannot give any title to paternal power we have already showed that a father may have a natural right to some kind of power over his children is easily granted but that an elder brother has so over his brethren remains to be proved god or nature has not any where that i know placed such jurisdiction in the first born nor can reason find any such natural superiority amongst brethren the law of moses gave a double portion of the goods and possessions to the eldest but we find not any here that naturally or by gods institution superiority or dominion belonged to him and the instances there brought by our author are but slender proofs of a right to civil power and dominion in the first born and do rather show the contrary his words are in the forecited place and therefore we find god told cain of his brother abel his desire shall be subject unto thee and thou shalt rule over him to which i answer these words of god to cain are by many interpreters with great reason understood in a quite different sense than what our author uses them in whatever was meant by them it could not be that cain as elder had a natural dominion over abel for the words are conditional if thou dost well and so personal to cain and whatever was signified by them did depend on his carriage and not follow his birthright and therefore could by no means be an establishment of dominion in the firstborn in general for before this abel had his distinct territories by right of private dominion as our author himself confesses o which he could not have had to the prejudice of the heirs title if by divine institution cain as heir were to inherit all his fathers dominion if this were intended by god as the charter of primogeniture and the grant of dominion to the elder brothers in general as such by right of inheritance we might expect it should have included all his brethren for we may well suppose adam from whom the world was to be peopled had by this time that these were grown up to be men more sons than these two whereas abel himself is not so much as named and the words in the original can scarce with any good construction be applied to him it is too much to build a doctrine of so mighty consequence upon so doubtful and obscure a place of scripture which may well nay better be understood in a quite different sense and so can be but an ill proof being as doubtful as the thing to be proved by it especially when there is nothing else in scripture or reason to be found that favours or supports it it follows p accordingly when jacob bought his brothers birthright isaac blessed him thus be lord over thy brethren and let the sons of thy mother bow before thee another instance take it brought by our author to evince dominion due to birthright and an admirable one it is for it must be no ordinary way of reasoning in a man that is pleading for the natural power of kings and against all compact to bring for proof of it an example where his own account of it founds all the right upon compact and settles empire in the younger brother unless buying and selling be no compact for he tells us when jacob bought his birthright but passing by that let us consider the history itself with what use our author makes of it and we shall find the following mistakes about it that our author reports this as if isaac given jacob this blessing immediately upon his purchasing the birthright for he says when jacob bought isaac blessed him which is plainly otherwise in the scripture for it appears there was a distance of time between and if we will take the story in the order it lies it must be no small distance all isaacs sojourning in gerar and transactions with abimelech gen xxvi coming between rebecca being then beautiful and consequently young but isaac when he blessed jacob was old and decrepit and esau also complains of jacob gen xxvii that two times he had supplanted him he took away my birthrigllt says he and behold now he hath taken away my blessing words that i think signify distance of time and difference of action another mistake of our authors is that he supposes isaac gave jacob the blessing and bid him be lord over his brethren because he had the birthright for our author brings this example to prove that he that has the birthright has thereby a right to be lord over his brethren but it is also manifest by the text that isaac had no consideration of jacobs having bought the birthright for when he blessed him he considered him not as jacob but took him for esau nor did esau understand any such connexion between birthright and the blessing for he says he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing whereas had the blessing which was to be lord over his brethren belonged to the birthright esau could not have complained of this second as a cheat jacob having got nothing but what esau had sold him when he sold him his birthright so that it is plain dominion if these words signify it was not understood to belong to the birthright and that in those days of the patriarchs dominion was not understood to be the right of the heir but only a greater portion of goods is plain from gen xxi for sarah taking isaac to be heir says cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son whereby could be meant nothing but that he should not have a presence to an equal share of his fathers estate after his death but should have his portion presently and be gone accordingly we read gen xxv that abraham gave all that he had unto isaac but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived that is abraham having given portions to all his other sons and sent them away that which he had reserved being the greatest part of his substance isaac as heir possessed after his death but by being heir he had no right to be lord over his children for if he had why should sarah endeavour to rob him of one of his subjects or lessen the number of his slaves by desiring to have ishmael sent away thus as under the law the privilege of birthright was nothing but a double portion so we see that before moses in the patriarchs time from whence our author pretends to take his model there vas no knowledge no thought that birthright gave rule or empire paternal or kingly authority to any one over his brethren if this be not plain enough in the story of isaac and ishmael he that will look into chron v may there read these words reuben as the firstborn but forasmuch as he defiled his fathers bed his birthright was given unto the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright for judah prevailed above his brethren and of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was josephs what this birthright was jacob blessing joseph gen xlviii telleth us in these words moreover i have given thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow whereby it is not only plain that the birthright was nothing but a double portion but the text in chronicles is express against our authors doctrine and shows that dominion was no part of the birthright for it tells us that joseph the birthright but judah the dominion one would think our author were very fond of the very name of birthright when he brings this instance of jacob and esau to prove that dominion belongs to the heir over his brethren because it will be but an ill example to prove that dominion by gods ordination belonged to the eldest son because jacob the youngest here had it let him come by it how he would for if it prove any thing it can only prove against our author that the assignment of dominion to the eldest is not by divine institution which would then be unalterable for if by the law of god or nature absolute power and empire belongs to the eldest son and his heirs so that they are supreme monarchs and all the rest of their brethren slaves our author gives us reason to doubt whether the eldest son has a popover to part with it to the prejudice of his posterity since he tells us o that in grants and gifts that have their original from god or nature no inferior power of man can limit or make any law of prescription against them because this place gen xxvii brought by our author concerns not at all the dominion of one brother over the other nor the subjection of esau to jacob for it is plain in history that esau was never subject to jacob but lived apart in mount seir where he founded a distinct people and government and was himself prince over them as much as jacob was in his own family the text if considered can never be understood of esau himself or the personal dominion of jacob over him for the words brethren and sons of thy mother could not be used literally by isaac who knew jacob had only one brother and these words are so far from being true in a literal sense or establishing any dominion in jacob over esau that in the story we find the quite contrary for gen xxxii jacob several times calls esau lord and himself his servant and gen xxxiii he bowed himself seven times to the ground to esau whether esau then were a subject and vassal my as our author tells us all subjects are slaves to jacob and jacob his sovereign prince by birthright i leave the reader to judge and to believe if he can that these words of isaac be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee confirmed jacob in a sovereignty over esau upon the account of the birthright he had got from him he that reads the story of jacob and esau will find there never was any jurisdiction or authority that either of them had over the other after their fathers death they lived with the friendship and equality of brethren neither lord neither slave to his brother but independent of each other were both heads of their distinct families where they received no laws from one another but lived separately and were the roots out of which sprang two distinct people under two distinct governments this blessing then of isaac whereon our author would build the dominion of the elder brother signifies no more but what rebecca had been told from god gen xxv two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger and so jacob blessed judah gen xlix and gave him the sceptre and dominion from whence our author might have argued as well that jurisdiction and dominion belongs to the third son over his brethren as well as from this blessing of isaac that it belonged to jacob both these places contain only predictions of what should long after happen to their posterities and not any declaration of the right of inheritance to dominion in either and thus we have our authors two great and only arguments to prove that heirs are lords over their brethren because god tells cain gen iv that however sin might set upon him he ought or might be master of it for the most learned interpreters understood the words of sin and not of abel anal give so strong reasons for it that nothing can convincingly be inferred from so doubtful a text to our authors purpose because in this of gen xxvii isaac foretell that the israelites the posterity of jacob should have dominion over the edomites the posterity of esau therefore says our authorheirs are lords of their brethren i leave any one to judge of the conclusion and now we see our author has provided for the descending and conveyance down of adams monarchical power or paternal dominion to posterity by the inheritance of his heir succeeding to all his fathers authority and becoming upon his death as much lord as his father was not only over his own children but over his brethren and all descended from his father and so in infinitum but yet who this heir is he does not once tell us and all the light we have from him in this so fundamental a point is only that in his instance of jacob by using the word birthright as that which passed from esau to jacob he leaves us to guess that by heir he means the eldest son though i do not remember he any where mentions expressly the title of the firstborn but all along keeps himself under the shelter of the indefinite term heir but taking it to be has meaning that the eldest son is heir for if the eldest be not there will be no presence why the sons should not be all heirs alike and so by right of primogeniture has dominion over his brethren this is but one step towards the settlement of succession and the difficulties remain still as much as ever till he can show us who is meant by right heir in all those cases which may happen where the present possessor hath no son this he silently passes over and perhaps wisely too for what can be wiser after one has affirmed that the person having that power as well as the power and form of government is the ordinance of god and by divine institution viz o p than to be careful not to start any question concerning the person the resolution whereof will certainly lead him into a confession that god and nature hath determined nothing about him and if our author cannot show who by right of nature or a clear positive law of god has the next right to inherit the dominion of this natural monarch he has been at such pains about when he died without a son he might have spared his pains in all the rest it being more necessary for the settling mens consciences and determining their subjection and allegiance to show them who by original right superior and antecedent to the will or any act of men hath a title to this paternal jurisdiction than it is to show that by nature there was such a jurisdiction it being to no purpose for me to know there is such a paternal power which i ought and am disposal to obey unless where there are many pretenders i also know the person that is rightfully in vested and endowed with it for the main matter in question being concerning the duty of my obedience and the obligation of conscience i am under to pay it to him that is of right my lord and ruler i must know the person that this right of paternal power resides in and so empowers him to claim obedience from me for let it be true what he says p that civil power not only in general is by divine institution but even the assignment of it specially to the eldest parents and o that not only the power or right of government but the form of the power of governing and the person having that power are all the ordinance of god yet unless he show us in all cases who is this person ordained by god who is this eldest parent all his abstract notions of monarchical power will signify just nothing when they are to be reduced to practice and men are conscientiously to pay their obedience for paternal jurisdiction being not the thing to be obeyed because it cannot command but is only that which gives one man a right which another hath not and if it come by inheritance another man cannot have to command and be obeyed it is ridiculous to say i pay obedience to the paternal power when i obey him to whom paternal power gives no right to my obedience for he can have no divine right to my obedience who cannot show his divine right to the power of ruling over me as well as that by divine right there is such a power in the world and hence not being able to make out any princes title to government as heir to adam which therefore is of no use and had been better let alone he is fain to resolve all into present possession and makes civil obedience as due to an usurper as to a lawful king and thereby the usurpers title as good his words are o and they deserve to be remembered if an usurper dispossess the true heir the subjects obedience to the fatherly popover must go along and wait upon gods providence but i shall leave his title of usurpers to be examined in its due place and desire my sober reader to consider what thanks princes owe such politics as this which can suppose paternal popover ie a right to government in the hands of a cade or a cromwell and so all obedience being due to paternal power the obedience of subjects will be due to them by the same right and upon as good grounds as it is to lawful princes and yet this as dangerous a doctrine as it is must necessarily follow from making all political power to be nothing else but adams paternal power by right and divine institution descending from him without being able to show to whom it descended or who is heir to it to settle government in the world and to lay obligations to obedience on any mans conscience it is as necessary supposing with our author that all power be nothing but the being possessed of adams fatherhood to satisfy him who has a right to this power this fatherhood when the possessor dies without sons to succeed immediately to it as it was to tell him that upon the death of the father the eldest son had a right to it for it is still to be remembered that the great question is and that which our author would be thought to contend for if he did not sometimes forget it what persons have a right to be obeyed and not whether there be a power in the world which is to be called paternal without knowing in whom it resides for so it be a popover ie right to govern it matters not whether it be termed paternal or regal natural or acquired whether you call it supreme fatherhood or supreme brotherhood will be all one provided we know who has it i go on then to ask whether in the inheriting of this paternal power this supreme fatherhood the grandson by a daughter hath a right before a nephew by a brother whether the grandson by the eldest son being an infant before the younger son a man and able whether the daughter before the uncle or any other man descended by a male line whether a grandson by a younger daughter before a granddaughter by an elder daughter whether the elder son by a concubine before a younger son by a wife from whence also will arise many questions of legitimation and what in nature is the difference betwixt a wife and a concubine for as to the municipal or positive laws of men they can signify nothing here it may farther be asked whether the eldest son being a fool shall inherit this paternal power before the younger a wise man and what degree of folly it must be that shall exclude him and who shall be judge of it whether the son of a fool excluded for his folly before the son of his wise brother who reigned who has the paternal power whilst the widowqueen is with child by the deceased king and nobody knows whether it will be a son or a daughter which shall be heir of the two male twins who by the dissection of the mother were laid open to the world whether a sister by the halfblood before a brothers daughter by the whole blood these and many more such doubts might be proposed about the titles of succession and the right of inheritance and that not as idle speculations but such as in history we shall find have concerned the inheritance of crowns and kingdoms and if ours want them we need not go farther for famous examples of it than the other kingdom in this very island which having been fully related by the ingenious and learned author of patriarcha non monarcha i need say no more of till our author hath resolved all the doubts that mall arise about the next heir and showed that they are plainly determined by the law of nature or the revealed law of god all his suppositions of a monarchical absolute supreme paternal power in adam and the descent of that power to his heirs would not be of the least use to establish the authority or make out the title of any one prince now on earth but would rather unsettle and bring all into question for let our author tell us as long as he pleases and let all men believe it too that adam had a paternal and thereby a monarchical power that this the only power in the world descended to his heirs and that there is no other power in the world but this lot this be all as clear demonstration as it is manifest error yet if it be not past doubt to whom this paternal power descends and whose now it is nobody can be under any obligation of obedience unless any one will say that i am bound to pay obedience to paternal power in a man who has no more paternal power than i myself which is all one as to say i obey a man because he has a right to govern and if i be asked how i know he has a right to govern i should answer it cannot be known that he has any at all for that cannot be the reason of my obedience which i know not to be so much less can that be a reason of my obedience which nobody at all can know to be so and therefore all this ado about adams fatherhood the greatness of its power and the necessity of its supposal helps nothing to establish the power of those that govern or to determine the obedience of subjects who are to obey if they cannot tell whom they are to obey or it cannot be known who are to govern and who to obey in the state the world is now it is irrecoverably ignorant who is adams heir this fatherhood this monarchical power of adam descending to his heirs would be of no more use to the government of mankind than it would be to the quieting of men s consciences or securing their healths if our author had assured them that adam had a power to forgive sins or cure diseases which by divine institution descended to his heir whilst this heir is impossible to be known and should not he do as rationally who upon this assurance of our author went and confessed his sins and expected a good absolution or took physic with expectation of health from any one who had taken on himself the name of priest or physician or thrust himself into those employments saying i acquiesce in the absolving power descending from adam or i shall be cured by the medicinal power descending from adam as he who says i submit to and obey the paternal lower descending from adam when it is confessed all these powers descend only to his single heir and that heir is unknown it is true the civil lawyers have pretended to determine some of these cases concerning the succession of princes but by our authors principles they have meddled in a matter that belongs not to them for if all political power be derived only from adam and be to descend only to his successive heirs by the ordinance of god and divine institution this is a right antecedent and paramount to all government and therefore the positive laws of men cannot determine that which is itself the foundation of all law and government and is to receive its rule only from the law of god and nature and that being silent in the case i am apt to think there is no such right to be conveyed this way i am sure it would be to no purpose if there were and men would be more at a loss concerning government and obedience to governors than if there were no such right since by positive laws and compact which divine institution if there be any shuts out all these endless inextricable doubts can be safely provided against but it can never be understood how a divine natural right and that of such moment as is all order and peace in the world should be conveyed down to posterity without any plain natural or divine rule concerning it and there would be an end of all civil government if the assignment of civil power were by divine institution to the heir and yet by that divine institution the person of the heir could not be known this paternal regal power being by divine right only his it leaves no room for human prudence or consent to place it any where else for if only one man hath a divine right to the obedience of mankind nobody curl claim bleat obedience but he that can show that right nor can mens consciences by any other presence he obliged to it and thus this doctrine cuts up all government by the roots thus we see how our author laying it for a sure foundation that the very person that is to rule is the ordinance of god and by divine institution tells us at large only that this person is the heir but who this heir is he leaves us to guess and so this divine institution which assigns it to a person whom vie have no rule to know is just as good as an assignment to nobody at all but whatever our author does divine institution makes no such ridiculous assignments nor can god be supposed to make it a sacred law that one certain person should have a right to something and yet not give rules to mark out and know that person by or give an heir a divine right to power and yet not point out who that heir is it is rather to be thought that an heir had no such right by divine institution than that god should give such a right to the heir but yet leave it doubtful and undeterminable who such heir is if god lead given the land of canaan to abraham and in general terms to somebody after him without naming his seed whereby it might be known who that somebody was it would have been as good and useful an assignment to determine the right to the land of canaan as it would be the determining the right of crowns to give empire to adam and his successive heirs after him without telling who his heir is for the word heir without a rule to know who it is signifies no more than somebody i know not whom god making it a divine institution that men should not marry those who were of near kin thinks it not enough to say none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to uncover albeit nakedness but moreover gives rules to know who are those near of kin forbidden by divine institution or else that law would have been of no use it being to no purpose to lay restraint or give privileges to men in such general terms as the particular person concerned cannot be known by but god not having any where said the next heir shall inherit all his fathers estate or dominion we are not to wonder that he hath nowhere appointed who that heir should be for never having intended any such thing never designed any heir in that sense we cannot expect he should any where nominate or appoint any person to it as we might had it been otherwise and therefore in scripture though the word heir occur yet there is no such thing as heir in our authors sense one that was by right of nature to inherit all that his father had exclusive of his brethren hence sarah supposes that if ishmael staid in the house to share in abrahams estate after his death this son of a bondwoman might be heir with isaac and therefore says she cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son but this cannot excuse our author who telling us there is in every number of men one who is right and next heir to adam ought to have told us what the laws of den scent are but he having been so sparing to instruct us by rules how to know who is heir let us see in the next place what his history out of scripture on which he pretends wholly to build his government gives us in this necessary and fundamental point our author to make good the title of his look p begins his history of the descent of adams regal power p in these words this lordship which adam by command had over the whole world and by right descending from him the patriarchs did enjoy was a large c how does he prove that the patriarchs by descent did enjoy it for dominion of life and deaths says he we find judah the father pronounced sentence of death against thamar his daughterinlaw for playing the harlot p how does this prove that judah had absolute and sovereign authority he pronounced sentence of death the pronouncing of sentence of death is not a certain mark of sovereignty but usually the office of inferior magistrates the power of making laws of life and death is indeed a mark of sovereignty but pronouncing the sentence according to those laws may be done by others and therefore this will but ill prove that he had sovereign authority as if one should say judge jefferies pronounced sentence of death in the late times therefore judge jefferies had sovereign authority but it will be said judah did it not by commission from another and therefore did it in his own right who knows whether he had any right at all heat of passion might carry him to do that which he had no authority to do judah had dominion of life and death how does that appear he exercised it he pronounced sentence of death against thamar our author thinks it is very good proof that because he did it therefore he had a right to do it he lay with her also by the same way of proof he had a right to do that too if the consequence be good from doing to a right of doing absalom too may be reckoned amongst our authors sovereigns for he pronounced such a sentence of death against his brother amnon and much upon a like occasion and had it executed too if that be sufficient to prove a dominion of life and death but allowing this all to be clear demonstration of sovereign power who was it that had this lordship by right descending to him from adam as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch judah says our author judah a younger son of jacob his father and elder brethren living so that if our authors own proof be to be taken a younger brother may in the life of his father and elder brothers by right of descent enjoy adams monarchical power and if one so qualified may be a monarch by descent why may not every man if judah his father and elder brethren living were one of adams heirs i know not who can be excluded from this inheritance all men by inheritance may be monarchs as well as judah touching war we see that abraham commanded an army of soldiers of his own family and esau met his brother jacob with men at arms for matter of peace abraham made a league with abimelech c p is it not possible for a man to have men in his family without being heir to adam a planter in the west indies has more and might if he pleased who doubts muster them up and lead them out against the indians to seek reparation upon any injury received from them and an this without the absolute dominion of a monarch descending to him from adam would it not be an admirable argument to prove that all power by gods institution descended from adam by inheritance and that the very person and power of this planter were the ordinance of god because he had power in his family over servants born in his house and bought with his money for this was just abrahams case those who were rich in the patriarchs days as in the west indies now bought men and maidservants and by their increase as well as purchasing of new came to have large and numerous families which though they made use of in war or peace can it be thought the power they had over them was an inheritance descended from adam when it was the purchase of their money a mans riding in an expedition against an enemy his horse bought in a fair would be as good a proof that the owner enjoyed the lordship which adam by command had over the whole world by right descending to him as abrahams leading out the servants of his family is that the patriarchs enjoyed this lordship by descent from adam since the title to the power the master had in both cases whether over slaves or horses was only from his purchase and the getting a dominion over any thing by bargain and money is a new way of proving one had it by descent and inheritance but making war and peace are marks of sovereignty let it be so in politic societies may not therefore a man in the west indies who hath with him sons of his own friends or companions soldiers under pay or slaves bought with money or perhaps a band made up of all these make war and peace if there should be occasion and ratify the articles too with an oath without being a sovereign an absolute king over those who went with him he that says he cannot must then allow many masters of ships many private planters to be absolute monarchs for as much as this they have done war and peace cannot be made for politic societies but by the supreme power of such societies because war and peace giving a different motion to the force of such a politic body none can make war or peace but that which has the direction of the force of the whole body and that in politic societies is only the supreme power in voluntary societies for the time he that has such a power by consent may make war and peace and so may a single man for himself the state of war not consisting in the number of partisans but the enmity of the parties where they have no superior to appeal to the actual making of war or peace is no proof of any other power but only of disposing those to exercise or cease acts of enmity for whom he makes it and this power in many cases any one may have without any politic supremacy and therefore the making of war or peace will not prove that every one that does so is a politic ruler much less a king for then commonwealths must be kings too for they do as certainly make war and peace as monarchical government but granting this a mark of sovereignty in abraham is it a proof of the descent to him of adams sovereignty over the whole world if it be it will surely be as good a proof of the descent of adams lordship to others too and then commonwealths as well as abraham will be heirs of adam for they make war and peace as well as he if you say that the lordship of adam doth not by right descend to commonwealths though they male war and peace the same say i of abraham and then there is an end of your argument if you stand to your argument and say those that do make war and peace as commonwealths do without doubt do inherit adams lordship there is an end of your monarchy unless you will say that commonwealths by descent enjoying adams lordship are monarchies and that indeed would be a new way of making all the governments in the world monarchical to give our author the honour of this new invention for i confess it is not i have first found it out by tracing his principles and so charged it on him it is fit my readers know that as absurd as it may seem he teaches it himself p where he ingenuously says in all kingdoms and commonwealths in the world whether the prince be the supreme father of the people or but the true heir to such a father or come to the crown by usurpation or election or whether some few or a multitude govern the commonwealth yet still the authority that is in any one or in many or in all these is the only right and natural authority of a supreme father which right of fatherhood he often tells us is regal and royal authority as particularly p the page immediately preceding this instance of abraham this regal authority he says those that govern commonwealths have and if it be true that regal and royal authority be in those that govern commonwealths it is as true that commonwealths are governed by kings for if regal authority be in him that governs he that governs must needs be a king and so all common wealths are nothing but downright monarchies and then what need any more ado about the matter the governments of the world are as they should be there is nothing but monarchy in it this without doubt was the surest way our author could have found to turn all other governments but monarchical out of the world but all this scarce proves abraham to have been a king as heir to adam if by inheritance he kind been king lot who was of the same family must needs have been his subject by that title before the servants in his family but we see they lived as friends and equals and when their herdsmen could not agree there was no presence of jurisdiction or superiority between them but they parted by consent gen xiii hence he is called both by abraham and by the text abrahams brother the name of friendship and equality and not of jurisdiction and authority though he were really but his nephew and if our author knows that abraham was adams heir and a king it was more it seems than abraham himself knew or his servant whom he sent a wooing for his son for when he sets out the advantages of the match gen xxiv thereby to prevail with the young woman and her friends he says i am abrahams servant and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all he hath can one think that a discreet servant that was thus particular to set out his masters greatness would have omitted the crown isaac was to have if he had known of any such can it be imagined he should have neglected to have told them on such an occasion as this that abraham was a king a name well known at that time for he had nine of them his neighbours if he or his master had thought any such thing the likeliest matter of all the rest to make his errand successful but this discovery it seems was reserved for our author to make two or years after and let him enjoy the credit of it only he should have taken care that some of adams land should have descended to this his heir as well as all adams lordship for though this lordship which abraham if we may believe our author as well as the other patriarchs by right descending to him did enjoy was as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch which hath been since the creation yet his estate his territories his dominions were very narrow and scanty for he had not the possession of a foot of land till he bought a field and a cave of the sons of heth to bury sarah in the instance of esau joined with this of abraham to prove that the lordship which adam had over the whole world by right descending from him the patriarchs did enjoy is yet more pleasant than the former esau met his brother jacob with men at arms he therefore was a king by right of heir to adam four hundred armed men then however got together are enough to prove him that leads them to be a king and adams heir there have been tories in ireland whatever there are in other countries who would have thanked our author for so honourable an opinion of them especially if there had been nobody near with a better title of armed men to question their royal authority of it is a shame for men to trifle so to say no worse of it in so serious an argument here esau is brought as a proof that adams lordship adams absolute dominion as large as that of any monarch descended by right to the patriarchs and in this very chap p jacob is brought as an instance of one that by birthright was lord over his brethren so we have here two brothers absolute monarchs by the same title and at the same time heirs to adam the eldest heir to adam because he met his brother with men and the youngest heir to adam by birth right esau enjoyed the lordship which adam had over the whole world by right descending to him in as large and ample manner as the absolutest dominion of any monarch and at the same time jacob lord over him by the right heirs have to be lords over their brethren risum teneatis i never i confess met with any man of parts so dexterous as sir robert at this way of arguing but it w as his misfortune to light upon an hypothesis that could not be accommodated to the nature of things and human affairs his principles could not be made to agree with that constitution and order which god lead settled in the world and therefore must needs often clash with common sense and experience in the next section he tells us this patriarchal power continued not only till the flood but after it as the name patriarch cloth in part prove the word patriarch cloth more than in part prove that patriarchal power continued in the world as long as there were patriarchs for it is necessary that patriarchal power should be whilst there are patriarchs as it is necessary there should be paternal or conjugal power whilst there are fathers or husbands but this is but playing with names that which he would fallaciously insinuate is the thing in question to be proved viz that the lordship which adam had over the world the supposed absolute universal dominion of adam by right descending from him the patriarchs did enjoy if he affirms such an absolute monarchy continued to the flood in the world i would be glad to know what records he has it from for i confess i cannot find a word of it in my bible if by patriarchal power he means any thing else it is nothing to the matter in hand and how the name patriarch in some part proves that those who are called by that name had absolute monarchical power i confess i do not see and therefore i think needs no answer till the argument from it be made out a little clearer the three sons of noah had the world says our author divided amongst them by their father for of them was the whole world overspread p the world might be overspread by the offspring of noahs sons though he never divided the world amongst them for the earth might be replenished without being divided so that all our authors argument here proves no such division however i allow it to him and then ask the world being divided amongst them which of the three was adams heir if adams lordship adams monarchy by right descended only to the eldest then the other two could be but his subjects his slaves if by right it descended to all three brothers by the same right it will descend to all mankind and then it will be impossible what he says p that heirs are lords of their brethren should be true but all brothers and consequently all men will be equal and independent all heirs to adams monarchy and consequently all monarchs too one as much as another but it will be said noah their father divided the world amongst them so that our author will allow more to noah than he will to god almighty for o he thought it hard that god himself should give the world to noah and his sons to the prejudice of noahs birthright his words are noah was left sole heir to the world why should it be thought that god would disinherit him of his birthright and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children and yet he here thinks it fit that noah should disinherit shem of his birthright and divide the world betwixt him and his brethren so that his birthright when our author pleases must and when he pleases must not be sacred and inviolable if noah did divide the world between his sons and his assignment of dominions to them were good there is an end of divine institution all our authors discourse of adams heir with whatsoever he builds on it is quite out of doors the natural power of kings falls to the ground and then the form of the power governing and the person having that power will not be as he says they are o the ordinance of god but they will he ordinances of man for if the right of the heir be the ordinance of god a divine right no man father or not father can alter it if it be not a divine right it is only human depending on the will of man and so where human institution gives it not the firstborn has no right at all above his brethren and men may put government into what hands and under what form they please he goes on most of the civilest nations of the earth labour to fetch their original from some of the sons or nephews of noah p how many do most of the civilest nations amount to and who are they i fear the chinese a very great and civil people as well as several other people of the east west north and south trouble not themselves much about this matter all that believe the bible which i believe are our authors most of the civilest nations must necessarily derive themselves from noah but for the rest of the world they think little of his sons or nephews but if the heralds and antiquaries of all nations for it is these men generally that labour to find out the originals of nations or all the nations themselves stout labour to fetch their original from some of the sons or nephews of noah what would this be to prove that the lordship which adam had over the whole world by a right descended to the patriarchs whoever nations or races of men labour to fetch their original from may be concluded to be thought by them men of renown famous to posterity for the greatness of their virtues and actions but beyond these they look not nor consider who they were heirs to but look on them as such as raised themselves by their own virtue to a degree that would give lustre to those who in future ages could pretend to derive themselves from them but if it were ogyges hercules brama tamerlain pharamond nay if jupiter and saturn were the names from whence divers races of men both ancient and modern have laboured to derive their original will that prove that those men enjoyed the lordship of adam by right descending to them if not this is but a flourish of our authors to mislead his reader that in itself signifies nothing to as much purpose is what he tells us p concerning this division of the world that some say it was by lot and others that noah sailed round the mediterranean in ten years and divided the world into asia afric and europe portions for his three sons america then it seems was left to be his that could catch it why our author takes such pains to prove the division of the world by noah to his sons and will not leave out an imagination though no better than a dream that he can find any where to favour it is hard to guess since such a division if it prove any thing must necessarily take away the title of adams heir unless three brothers can all together be heirs of adam and therefore the following words howsoever the manner of this division be uncertain yet it is most certain the division was by families from noah and his children over which the parents were heads and princes p if allowed him to be true and of any force to prove that all the power in the world is nothing but the lordship of adams descending by right they will only prove that the fathers of the children are all heirs to this lordship of adam for if in those days cham and japhet and other parents besides the eldest son were heads and princes over their families and had a right to divide the earth by families what hinders younger brothers being fathers of families from having the same right if cham and japhet were princes by right descending to them notwithstanding any title of heir in their eldest brother younger brothers by the same right descending to them are princes now and so all our authors natural power of kings will reach no farther than their own children and no kingdom by this natural right can be bigger than a family for either this lordship of adam over the whole world by right descends only to the eldest son and then there can be but one heir as our author says p or else it by right descends to all the sons equally and then every father of a family will have it as well as the three sons of noah take which you will it destroys the present governments and kingdoms that are now in the world since whoever has this natural power of a king by right descending to him must have it either as our author tells us cain had it and be lord over his brethren and so be alone king of the whole world or else as he tells us here shem cham and japhet had it three brothers and so be only prince of his own family and all families independent one of another all the world must be only one empire by the right of the next heir or else every family be a distinct government of itself by the lordship of adams descending to parents of families and to this only tend all the proofs he here gives us of the descent of adams lordship for continuing his story of this descent he says in the dispersion of babel we must certainly find the establishment of royal power throughout the kingdoms of the world p if you must find it pray do and you will help us to a new piece of history but you must show it us before we shall be bound to believe that regal power was established in the world upon your principles for that regal power was established in the kingdoms of the world i think nobody will dispute but that there should be kingdoms in the world whose several kings enjoyed their crowns by right descending to them from adam that we think not only apocryphal but also utterly impossible if our author has no better foundation for his monarchy than a supposition of what was done at the dispersion of babel the monarchy he erects thereon whose top is to reach to heaven to unite mankind will serve only to divide and scatter them as that tower did and instead of establishing civil government and order in the world will produce nothing but effusion for he tells us the nations they were divided into were distinct families which had fathers for rulers over them whereby it appears that even in the confusion god was careful to preserve the fatherly authority by distributing the diversity of languages according to the diversity of families p it would have been a hard matter for any one but our author to have found out so plainly in the text he here brings that all the nations in that dispersion were governed by fathers and that god was careful to preserve the fatherly authority the words of the text are these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their stations and the same thing is said of cham and japhet after an enumeration of their posterities in all which there is not one word said of their governors or forms of government of fathers or fatherly authority but our author who is very quicksighted to spy out fatherhood where nobody else could see any the least glimpses of it tells us positively their rulers were fathers and god was careful to preserve the fatherly authority and why because those of the same family spoke the same language and so of necessity in the division kept together just as if one should argue thus hannibal in his army consisting of divers nations kept those of the same language together therefore fathers were captains of each band and hannibal was careful of the fatherly authority or in peopling of carolina the english french scotch and welsh that are there plant themselves together and by them the country is divided in their lands after their tongues after their families after their nations therefore care was taken of the fatherly authority or because in many parts of america every little tribe was a distinct people with a different language one should infer that therefore god was careful to preserve the fatherly authority or that therefore their rulers enjoyed adams lordship by right descending to them though we know not who were their governors nor what their form of government but only that they were divided into little indepen dent societies speaking different languages the scripture says not a word of their rulers or forms of government but only gives an account how mankind came to be divided into distinct languages and nations and therefore it is not to argue from the authority of scripture to tell us positively fathers were their rulers when the scripture says no such thing but to set up fancies in ones own brain when we confidently aver matter of fact where records are utterly silent upon a like ground ie none at all he says that they were not confused multitudes without heads and governors and at liberty to choose what governors or governments they pleased for i demand when mankind were all yet of one language all congregated in the plain of shinar were they then all under one monarch who enjoyed else lordship of adam by right descending to him if they were not there were then no thoughts it is plain of adams heir no right to government known then upon that title no care taken by god or man of adams fatherly authority if when mankind were but one people dwelt altogether and were of one language and were upon building a city together and when it is plain they could not but know the right heir for shem lived till isaacs time a long while after the division at babel if then i say they were not under the monarchical government of adams fatherhood by right descending to the heir it is plain there w as no regard had to the fatherhood no monarchy acknowledged due to adams heir no empire of shems in asia and consequently no such division of the world by noah as our author has talked of as far as we can conclude any thing from scripture in this matter it seems from this place that if they had any government it was rather a commonwealth than an absolute monarchy for the scripture tells us gen xi they said it was not a prince commanded the building of this city and tower it was not by the command of one monarch but by the consultation of many a free people let us build us a city they built it for themselves as free men not as slaves for their lord and master that we be not scattered abroad having a city once built and fixed habitations to settle our abodes and families this was the consultation and design of a people that were at liberty to part asunder but desired to keep in one body and could not have been either necessary or likely in men tied together under the government of one monarch who if they had been as our author tells us all slaves under the absolute dominion of a monarch needed not have taken such care to hinder themselves from wandering out of the reach of his dominion i demand whether this be not plainer in scripture than any thing of adams heir or fatherly authority but if being as god says gen xi one people they had one ruler one king by natural right absolute and supreme over them what care had god to preserve the paternal authority of the supreme fatherhood if on a sudden he suffer for so many our author talks of distinct nations to be erected out of it under distinct governors and at once to withdraw themselves from the obedience of their sovereign this is to intitle gods care how and to what we please can it be sense to say that god was careful to preserve the fatherly authority in those who had it not for if these were subjects under a supreme prince what authority had they was it an instance of gods care to preserve the fatherly authority when he took away the true supreme fatherhood of the natural monarch can it be reason to say that god for the preservation of fatherly authority lets several new governments with their governors start up who could not all have fatherly authority and is it not as much reason to say that god is careful to destroy fatherly authority when he supers one who is in possession of it to have his government torn in pieces and shared by several of his subjects would it not be an argument just like this for monarchical government to say when any monarchy was shattered to pieces and divided amongst revolted subjects that god was careful to preserve monarchical popover by rending a settled empire into a multitude of little governments if any one will say that what happens in providence to be preserved god is careful to preserve as a thing therefore to be esteemed by men as necessary or useful it is a peculiar propriety of speech which every one will not think fit to imitate but this i an sure is impossible to be either proper or true speaking that shem for example for he was then alive should have fatherly authority or sovereignty by right of fatherhood over that one people at babel and that the next moment shem yet living others should have fatherly authority or sovereignty by right of fatherhood over the same people divided into so many distinct governments either these fathers actually were rulers just before the confusion and then they were not one people but that god himself says they were or else they were a commonwealth and then where was monarchy or else these fathers had fatherly authority but knew it not strange that fatherly authority should be the only original of government amongst men and yet all mankind not know it and stranger yet that the confusion of tongues should reveal it to them all of a sudden that in an instant these should know that they had fatherly power and all others know that they were to obey it in them and every one know that particular fatherly authority to which he was a subject he that can think this arguing from scripture may from thence make out what model of an utopia will best suit with his fancy or interest and this fatherhood thus disposed of will justify both a prince who claims an universal monarchy and his subjects who being fathers of families shall quit subjection to him and canton his empire into less governments for themselves for it will always remain a doubt in which of these the fatherly authority resided till our outlook resolves us whether shem who was then alive or these new princes beginning so many new empires in his dominions and over his subjects had right to govern since our author tells us that both one and the other had fatherly which is supreme authority and are brought in by him as instances of those who did enjoy the lordships of adam by right descending to them which was as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch this at least is unavoidable that if god was careful to preserve the fatherly authority in the newerected nations it necessarily follows that he was as careful to destroy all pretences of adams heir since he took care and therefore did preserve the fatherly authority in so many at least that could not possibly be adams heirs when the right heir if god had ever ordained any such inheritance could not but be known shem then living and they being all one people nimrod is his next instance of enjoying this patriarchal power p but i know not for what reason our author seems a little unkind to him and says that he against right enlarged his empire by seizing violently on the rights of other lords of families these lords of families here revere called fathers of families in his account of the dispersion at babel but it matters not how they were called so we know who they are for this fatherly authority must be in them either as heirs to adam and so there could not be nor above one at once or else as natural parents over their children and so every father will have paternal authority over his children by the same right and in as large extent as those had and so be independent princes over their own offspring taking his lords of families in this latter sense as it is hard to give those words any other sense in this place he gives us a very pretty account of the original of monarchy in these following words p and in this sense he may be said to be the author and founder of monarchy viz as against right seizing violently on the rights of fathers over their children which paternal authority if it be in them by right of nature for else how could those come by it nobody can take from them without their own consents and then i desire our author and his friends to consider how far this will concern other princes and whether it will not according to his conclusion of that paragraph resolve all regal power of those whose dominions extend beyond their families either into tyranny and usurpation or election and consent of fathers of families which will differ very little from consent of the people all his instances in the next section p of the dukes of edom the nine kings in a little corner of asia in abrahams days the kings in canaan destroyed by joshua and the care he takes to prove that these were all sovereign princes and that every town in those days had a king are so many direct proofs against him that it was not the lordship of adam by right descending to them that made kings for if they had held their royalties by that title either there must have been but one sovereign over them all or else every father of a family had been as good a prince and had as good a claim to royalty as these for if all the sons of esau had each of them the younger as well as the eldest the right of fatherhood and so were sovereign princes after their fathers death the same right had their sons after them and so on to all posterity which will limit all the natural power of fatherhood only to be over the issue of their own bodies and their descendents which power of fatherhood dies with the head of each family and makes way for the like power of fatherhood to take place in each of his sons over their respective posterities whereby the power of fatherhood will be preserved indeed and is intelligible but will not be at all to our authors purpose none of the instances he brings are proofs of any power they had as heirs of adams paternal authority by the title of his fatherhood descending to them no nor of any power they had by virtue of their own for adams fatherhood being over all mankind it could descend to but one at once and from him to his right heir only and so there could by that title be but one king in the world at a time and by right of fatherhood not descending from adam it must be only as they themselves were fathers end so could be over none but their own posterity so that if those dukes of edom if abraham and the nine kings his neighbours if jacob and esau and the kings in canaan the kings mutilated by adonibeseck the kings that came to benhadad the kings of greece making war at troy were as our author contends all of them sovereign princes it is evident that kings derived their power from some other original than fatherhoodsince some of these had power over more than their own posterity and it is demonstration they could not be all heirs to adam for i challenge any man to make any presence to power by right of fatherhood either intelligible or possible in any one otherwise than either as adams heir or as progenitor over his own descendents naturally sprung from him and if our author could show that any one of these princes of which he gives us here so large a catalogue had his authority by either of these titles i think i might yield him the cause though it is manifest they are all impertinent and directly contrary to what he brings them to prove viz that the lordship which adam had over the world by right descended to the patriarchs having told us p that the patriarchal government continued in abraham isaac and jacob until the egyptian bondage p he tells us by manifest footsteps we may trace this paternal government unto the israelites coming into egypt allure the exercise of the supreme patriarchal government was intermitted because they were in subjection to a stronger prince what these footsteps are of paternal government in our authors sense ie of absolute monarchical power descending from adam and exercised by right of fatherhood we have seen that is for years no footsteps at all since in all that time he cannot produce any one example of any person who claimed or exercised regal authority by right of fatherhood or show any one who being a king was adams heir all that his proofs amount to is only this that there were fathers patriarchs and kings in that age of the world but that the fathers and patriarchs had any absolute arbitrary power or by what titles those kings had theirs and of what extent it was the scripture is wholly silent it is manifest by right of fatherhood they neither did nor could claim any title to dominion or empire to say that the exercise of supreme patriarchal government was intermitted because they were in subjection to a stronger prince proves nothing but what i before suspected viz that patriarchal jurisdiction or government is a fallacious expression and does not in our author signify what he would yet insinuate by it paternal and regal power such an absolute sovereignty as he supposes was in adam for how can he say that patriarchal jurisdiction was intermitted in egypt where there was a king under whose regal government the israelites were if patriarchal were absolute monarchical jurisdiction and if it were not but something else why does he make such ado about a power not in question and nothing to the purpose the exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction if patriarchal be regal was not intermitted whilst the israelites were in egypt it is true the exercise of regal power was not then in the hands of any of the promised seeds of abraham nor before neither that i know but what is that to the intermission of regal authority as descending from adam unless our author will have it that this chosen line of abraham had the right of inheritance to adams lordship and then to what purpose are his instances of the rulers in whom the fatherly authority was preserved in the confusion at isabel why does he bring the princes sons of ishmael and the dukes of edom and join them with abraham isaac and jacob as examples of the exercise of true patriarchal government if the exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction were intermitted in the world whenever the heirs of jacob had not supreme power i fear supreme patriarchal jurisdiction was not only intermitted but from the time of the egyptian bondage quite lost in the world since it will be hard to find from that time downwards any one who exercised it as an inheritance descending to him from the patriarchs abraham isaac and jacob i imagined monarchical government would have served his turn in the hands of pharaoh or any body one cannot easily discover in all places what his discourse tends to as particularly in this place it is not obvious to guess what he drives at when he says the exercise of supreme patriarchal jurisdiction in egypt or how this serves to make out the descent of adams lordship to the patriarchs or any body else for i thought he had been giving us out of scripture proofs and examples of monarchical government founded on paternal authority descending from adam and not an history of the jews amongst whom yet we find no kings till many years after they were a people and when kings were their rulers there is not the least mention or room for a presence that they were heirs to adam or kings by paternal authority i expected talking so much as he does of scripture that he would have produced thence a series of monarchs whose titles were clear to adams fatherhood and who as heirs to him owned and exercised paternal jurisdiction over their subjects and that this was the true patriarchal government whereas he neither proves thee the patriarchs were kings nor that either kings or patriarchs were heirs to adam or so much as pretended to it and one may as well prove that the patriarchs were all absolute monarchs that the power both of patriarchs and kings was only paternal and that this power descended to them from adam i say all these propositions may be as well proved by a confused account of a multitude of little kinds in the westindies out of ferdinando soto or any of our late histories of the northern america or by our authors kings of greece out of homer as by any thing he brings out of scripture in that multitude of kings he has reckoned up and methinks he should have let homer and his wars of troy alone since his great zeal to truth or monarchy carried him to such a pitch of transport against philosophers and poets that he tells us in his preface that there are too many in these days who please themselves in running after the opinions of philosophers and poets to find out such an original of government as might promise them some title to liberty to the great scandal of christianity and bringing in of atheism and yet these heathens philosopher aristotle and poet homer are not rejected by our zealous christian politician whenever they over any thing that seems to serve his turn whether to the great scandal of christianity and bringing in of atheism let him look this i cannot but observe in authors who it is visible write not for truth how ready zeal for interest and party is to entitle christianity to their designs and to charge atheism on those who will not without examining submit to their doctrines and blindly swallow their nonsense but to return to his scripture history our author farther tells us p that after the return of the israelites out of bondage god out of a special care of them chose moses and joshua successively to govern as princes in the place and stead of the supreme fathers if it be true that they returned out of bondage it must be in a state of freedom and must imply that both before and after this bondage they were free unless our author will say that changing of masters is returning out of bondage or that a slave returns out of bondage when he is removed from one gaily to another if then they returned out of bondage it is plain that in those days whatever our author in his preface says to the contrary there was a difference between a son a subject and a slave and that neither the patriarchs before nor their rulers after this egyptian bondage numbered their sons or subjects amongst their possessions and disposed of them with as absolute a dominion as they did their other goods this is evident in jacob to whom reuben offered his two sons as pledges and judah was at last surety for benjamins safe return out of egypt which all had been vain superfluous and but a sort of mockery if jacob had had the same power over every one of his family as he had over his ox or his ass as an owner over his substance and the offers that reuben or judah made had been such a security for returning of benjamin as if a man should take two lambs out of his lords flock and offer one as security that he will safely restore the other when they were out of this bondage what then god out of a special care of them the israelites it is well that once in his book he will allow god to have any care of the people for in other places he speaks of mankind as if god had no care of any part of them but only of their monarchs and that the rest of the people the societies of men were made as so many herds of cattle only for the service use and pleasure of their princes chose moses and joshua successively to govern as princes a shrewd argument our author has found out to prove gods care of the fatherly authority and adams heirs that here as an expression of his care of his own people he chooses those for princes over them that had not the least presence to either the persons chosen were moses of the tribe of levi and joshua of the tribe of ephraim neither of which had any title of fatherhood but says our author they were in the place and stead of the supreme fathers if god had any where as plainly declared his choice of such fathers to be rulers as he did of moses and joshua we might believe moses and joshua were in their place and stead but that being the question in debate till that be better proved moses being chosen by god to be ruler of his people will no more prove that government belonged to adams heir or to the fatherhood than gods choosing aaron of the tribe of levi to be priest will prove that the priesthood belonged to adams heir or the prime fathers since god would choose aaron to be priest and moses ruler in israel though neither of those offices were settled on adams heir or the fatherhood our author goes on and after them likewise for a time he raised up judges to defend his people in time of peril p this proves fatherly authority to be the original of government and that it descended from adam to his heirs just as well as what went before only here our author seems to confess that these judges who were all the governors they then had were only men of velour whom they made their generals to defend them in time of peril and cannot god raise up such men unless fatherhood have a title to government but says our author when god gave the israelites kings he reestablished the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government p how did god reestablish it by a law a positive command we find no such thing our author means then that when god gave theta a king in giving them a king he reestablished the right c to reestablish defacto the right of lineal succession to paternal government is to put a man in possession of that government which his fathers did enjoy and he by lineal succession had a right to for first if it were another government than what his ancestor had it was not succeeding to an ancient right but beginning a new one for if a prince should give a man besides his ancient patrimony which for some ages his family had been disseised of an additional estate never before in the possession of his ancestors he could not be said to reestablish the right of lineal succession to any more than what had been formerly enjoyed by his ancestors if therefore the power the kings of israel had were any thing more than isaac or jacob had it was not the reestablishing in them the right of succession to a power but giving them a new power however you please to call it paternal or not and whether isaac and jacob had the same power that the kings of israel had i desire any one by what has been above said to consider and i do not think he will find that either abraham isaac or jacob had any regal power at all next there can be no reestablishment of the prime and ancient right of lineal succession to any thing unless he that is put in possession of it has the right to succeed and be the true and next heir to him he succeeds to can that be a reestablishment which begins in a new family or that the reestablishment of an ancient right of lineal succession when a crown is given to one who has no right of succession to it and who if the lineal succession had gone on had been out of all possibility of presence to it saul the first king god gave the israelites was of the tribe of benjamin was the ancient and prime right of lineal succession reestablished in him the next was david the youngest son of jesse of the posterity of judah jacobs third son was the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government reestablished in him or in solomon his younger son and successor in the throne or in jeroboam over the ten tribes or in athaliah a woman who reigned six years an utter stranger to the royal blood if the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government were reestablished in any of these or their posterity the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government belongs to younger brothers as well as elder and may be reestablished in any man living for whatever younger brothers by ancient and prime right of lineal succession may have as well as the elder that every man living may have a right to by lineal succession and sir robert as well as any other and so what a brave right of lineal succession to his paternal or regal government our author has reestablished for the securing the rights and inheritance of crowns where every one may have it let the world consider but says our author however p whensoever god made choice of any special person to be king he intended that the issue also should have benefit thereof as being comprehended sufficiently in the person of the father although the father was only named in the grant this yet will not help out succession for if as our author says the benefit of the grant be intended to the issue of the grantee this will not direct the succession since if god give any thing to a man and his issue in general the claim cannot be to any one of that issue in particular every one that is of his race will have an equal right if it be said our author meant heir i believe our author was as willing as any body to have used that word if it would have served his turn but solomon who succeeded david in the throne being no more his heir than jeroboam who succeeded him in the government of the ten tribes was his issue our author had reason to avoid saying that god intended it to the heirs when that would not hold in a succession which our author could not except against and so he has left his succession as undetermined as if he had said nothing about it for if the regal power be given by god to a man and his issue as the land of canaan was to abraham and his seed must they not all have a title to it all share in it and one may as well say that by gods grant to abraham and his seed the land of canaan was to belong only to one of his seed exclusive of all others as by gods grant of dominion to a man and his issue this dominion was to belong in peculiar to one of his issue exclusive of all others but how will our author prove that whensoever god made choice of any special person to be a king he intended that the i suppose he means his issue also should have benefit thereof has he so soon forgot moses and joshua whom in this very section he says god out of a special care chose to govern as princes and the judges that god raised up had not these princes having the same authority of the supreme fatherhood the same power that the kings had and being specially chosen by god himself should not their issue have the benefit of that choice as well as davids or solomons if these had the paternal authority put into their hands immediately by god why had not their issue the benefit of this grant in a succession to this power or if they had it as adams heirs why did not their heirs enjoy it after them by right descending to them for they could not be heirs to one another was the power the same and from the same original in moses joshua and the judges as it was in david and the kings and was it inheritable in one and not in the other if it was not paternal authority then gods own people were governed by those that had not paternal authority and those governors did well enough without it if it were paternal authority and god chose the persons that were to exercise it our authors rule fails that whensoever god makes choice of any person to be supreme ruler for i suppose the name king has no spell in it it is not the title but the power makes the difference he intends that the issue also should have the benefit of it since from their coming out of egypt to davids time years the issue was never so sufficiently comprehended in the person of the father as that any son after the death of his father succeeded to the government amongst all those judges that judged israel if to avoid this it be said god always chose the person of the successor and so transferring the fatherly authority to him excluded his issue from succeeding to it that is manifestly not so in the story of jephthah where he articled with the people and they made him judge over them as is plain judg xi it is in vain then to say that whensoever god chooses any special person to have the exercise of paternal authority for if that be not to be king i desire to know the difference between a king and one having the exercise of paternal authority he intends the issue also should have the benefit of it since we find the authority the judges had ended with them and descended not to their issue and if the judges had not paternal authority i fear it will trouble our author or any of the friends to his principles to tell who had then the paternal authority that is the government and supreme power amongst the israelites and i suspect they must confess that the chosen people of god continued a people several hundreds of years without any knowledge or thought of this paternal authority or any appearance of monarchical government at all to be satisfied of this he need but read the story of the levite and the war thereupon with the benjamites in the three last chapters of judges and when he finds that the levite appeals to the people for justice that it was the tribes and the congregation that debated resolved and directed all that was done on that occasion he must conclude either that god was not careful to preserve the fatherly authority amongst his own chosen people or else that the fatherly authority may be preserved where there is no monarchical government if the latter then it will follow that though fatherly authority be ever so well proved yet it will not infer a necessity of monarchical government if the former it will seem very strange and improbable that god should ordain fatherly authority to be so sacred amongst the sons of men that there could be no power or government without it and yet that amongst us own people even whilst he is providing a government for them and therein prescribes rules to the several states and relations of men this great and fundamental one this most material and necessary of all the rest should he concealed and lie neglected for years after before i leave this i must ask flow our author knows that whensoever god makes choice of any special person to be king he intends that the issue should have the benefit thereof does god by the law of nature or revelation say so by the same law also he must say which of his issue must enjoy the crown in succession and so point out the heir or else leave his issue to divide or scramble for the government both mike absurd and such as will destroy the benefit of such grant to the issue when any such declaration of gods intention is produced it will be our duty to believe god intends it so but till that be done our author must show us some better warrant before we shall be obliged to receive lain as the authentic revealer of gods intentions the issue says our author is comprehended sufficiently in the person of the father although the father only was named in the grant and yet god when he gave the land of canaan to abraham gen xiii thought fit to put his seed into the grant too so the priesthood was given to aaron and his seed and the crown god gave not only to david but his seed also and however our author assures us that god intends that the issue should have the benefit of it when he chooses any person to be king yet we see that the kingdom which he gave to saul without mentioning his seed after him never came to any of his issue and why when god chose a person to be king he should intend that his issue should have the benefit of it more than when he chose one to be judge in israel i would fain know a reason or why does a errant of fatherly authority to a king more comprehend the issue than when a like grant is made to a judge is paternal authority by right to descend to the issue of one and not of the other there will need some reason to be shown of this difference more than the name when the thing given is the same fatherly authority and the manner of giving it gods choice of the person the same too for i suppose our author when he says god raised up judges will by no means allow they were chosen by the people but since our author has so confidently assured us of the care of god to preserve the fatherhood and pretends to build all he says upon the authority of the scripture we may well expect that that people whose law constitution and history are chiefly contained in the scripture should furnish him with the clearest instances of gods care of preserving the fatherly authority in that people who it is agreed he had a most peculiar care of let us see then what state this paternal authority or government was in amongst the jews from their beginning to be a people it was omitted by our authors confession from their coming into egypt till their return out of that bondage above years from thence till god gave the israelites a king about years more our author gives but a very slender account of it nor indeed all that time are there the least footsteps of paternal or regal government amongst them but then says our author god reestablished the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government what a lineal succession to paternal government was then established we have already seen i only now consider how long this lasted and that was to their captivity about years from thence to their destruction by the romans above years after the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government was again lost and they continued a people in the promised land without it so that of years that they were gods peculiar people they had hereditary kingly government amongst them not onethird of the time and of that time there is not the least footstep of one moment of paternal government nor the reestablishment of the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to it whether we suppose it to be derived as from its fountain from david saul abraham or which upon our authors principles is the only true from adam notes in grants and gifts that have their original from god or nature as the power of the father hath no inferior power of man can limit nor shake any law of prescription against them obs the scripture teaches that supreme power was originally in the father without any limitation obs of political power it having been shown in the foregoing discourse firstly that adam had not either by natural right of fatherhood or by positive donation from god any such authority over his children nor dominion over the world as is pretended secondly that if he had his heirs yet had no right to it thirdly that if his heirs had there being no law of nature nor positive law of god that determines which is the right heir in all cases that may arise the right of succession and consequently of bearing rule could not have been certainly determined fourthly that if even that had been determined yet the knowledge of which is the eldest line of adams posterity being so long since utterly lost that in the races of mankind and families of the world there remains not to one above another the least pretence to be the eldest house and to have the right of inheritance all these promises having as i think been clearly made out it is impossible that the rulers now on earth should make any benefit or derive any the least shadow of authority from that which is held to be the fountain of all power adams private dominion and paternal jurisdiction so that he that will not give just occasion to think that all government in the world is the product only of force and violence and that men live together by no other rules but that of beasts where the strongest carries it and so lay a foundation for perpetual disorder and mischief tumult sedition and rebellion things that the followers of that hypothesis so loudly cry out against must of necessity find out another rise of government another original of political power and another way of designing and knowing the persons that have it than what concerning the true original extent and end of civil government sir robert filmer hath taught us to this purpose i think it may not be amiss to set down what i take to be political power that the power of a magistrate over a subject may be distinguished from that of a father over his children a master over his servant a husband over his wife and a lord over his slave all which distinct powers happening sometimes together in the same man if he be considered under these different relations it may help us to distinguish these powers one from another and show the difference betwixt a ruler of a commonwealth a father of a family and a captain of a galley political power then i take to be a right of making laws with penalties of death and consequently all less penalties for the regulating and preserving of property and of employing the force of the community in the execution of such laws and in the defence of the commonwealth from foreign injury and all this only for the public good of the state of nature to understand political power aright and derive it from its original we must consider what estate all men are naturally in and that is a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature without asking leave or depending upon the will of any other man a state also of equality wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal no one having more than another there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature and the use of the same faculties should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection unless the lord and master of them all should by any manifest declaration of his will set one above another and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty this equality of men by nature the judicious hooker looks upon as so evident in itself and beyond all question that he makes it the foundation of that obligation to mutual love amongst men on which he builds the duties they owe one another and from whence he derives the great maxims of justice and charity his words are the like natural inducement hath brought men to know that it is no less their duty to love others than themselves for seeing those things which are equal must needs all have one measure if i cannot but wish to receive good even as much at every mans hands as any man can wish unto his own soul how should i look to have any part of my desire herein satisfied unless myself be careful to satisfy the like desire which is undoubtedly in other men weak being of one and the same nature to have anything offered them repugnant to this desire must needs in all respects grieve them as much as me so that if i do harm i must look to suffer there being no reason that others should show greater measure of love to me than they have by me showed unto them my desire therefore to be loved of my equals in nature as much as possible may be imposeth upon me a natural duty of bearing to themward fully the like affection from which relation of equality between ourselves and them that are as ourselves what several rules and canons natural reason hath drawn for direction of life no man is ignorant eccl pol i but though this be a state of liberty yet it is not a state of licence though man in that state have an uncontrollable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions yet he has not liberty to destroy himself or so much as any creature in his possession but where some nobler use than its bare preservation calls for it the state of nature has a law of nature to govern it which obliges every one and reason which is that law teaches all mankind who will but consult it that being all equal and independent no one ought to harm another in his life health liberty or possessions for men being all the workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise maker all the servants of one sovereign master sent into the world by his order and about his business they are his property whose workmanship they are made to last during his not one anothers pleasure and being furnished with like faculties sharing all in one community of nature there cannot be supposed any such subordination among us that may authorise us to destroy one another as if we were made for one anothers uses as the inferior ranks of creatures are for ours every one as he is bound to preserve himself and not to quit his station wilfully so by the like reason when his own preservation comes not in competition ought he as much as he can to preserve the rest of mankind and not unless it be to do justice on an offender take away or impair the life or what tends to the preservation of the life the liberty health limb or goods of another and that all men may be restrained from invading others rights and from doing hurt to one another and the law of nature be observed which willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind the execution of the law of nature is in that state put into every mans hands whereby every one has a right to punish the transgressors of that law to such a degree as may hinder its violation for the law of nature would as all other laws that concern men in this world be in vain if there were nobody that in the state of nature had a power to execute that law and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders and if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he has done every one may do so for in that state of perfect equality where naturally there is no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another what any may do in prosecution of that law every one must needs have a right to do and thus in the state of nature one man comes by a power over another but yet no absolute or arbitrary power to use a criminal when he has got him in his hands according to the passionate heats or boundless extravagancy of his own will but only to retribute to him so far as calm reason and conscience dictate what is proportionate to his transgression which is so much as may serve for reparation and restraint for these two are the only reasons why one man may lawfully do harm to another which is that we call punishment in transgressing the law of nature the offender declares himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity which is that measure god has set to the actions of men for their mutual security and so he becomes dangerous to mankind the tie which is to secure them from injury and violence being slighted and broken by him which being a trespass against the whole species and the peace and safety of it provided for by the law of nature every man upon this score by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general may restrain or where it is necessary destroy things noxious to them and so may bring such evil on any one who hath transgressed that law as may make him repent the doing of it and thereby deter him and by his example others from doing the like mischief and in this case and upon this ground every man hath a right to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature i doubt not but this will seem a very strange doctrine to some men but before they condemn it i desire them to resolve me by what right any prince or state can put to death or punish an alien for any crime he commits in their country it is certain their laws by virtue of any sanction they receive from the promulgated will of the legislature reach not a stranger they speak not to him nor if they did is he bound to hearken to them the legislative authority by which they are in force over the subjects of that commonwealth hath no power over him those who have the supreme power of making laws in england france or holland are to an indian but like the rest of the worldmen without authority and therefore if by the law of nature every man hath not a power to punish offences against it as he soberly judges the case to require i see not how the magistrates of any community can punish an alien of another country since in reference to him they can have no more power than what every man naturally may have over another besides the crime which consists in violating the laws and varying from the right rule of reason whereby a man so far becomes degenerate and declares himself to quit the principles of human nature and to be a noxious creature there is commonly injury done and some person or other some other man receives damage by his transgression in which case he who hath received any damage has besides the right of punishment common to him with other men a particular right to seek reparation from him that hath done it and any other person who finds it just may also join with him that is injured and assist him in recovering from the offender so much as may make satisfaction for the harm he hath suffered from these two distinct rights the one of punishing the crime for restraint and preventing the like offence which right of punishing is in everybody the other of taking reparation which belongs only to the injured party comes it to pass that the magistrate who by being magistrate hath the common right of punishing put into his hands can often where the public good demands not the execution of the law remit the punishment of criminal offences by his own authority but yet cannot remit the satisfaction due to any private man for the damage he has received that he who hath suffered the damage has a right to demand in his own name and he alone can remit the damnified person has this power of appropriating to himself the goods or service of the offender by right of selfpreservation as every man has a power to punish the crime to prevent its being committed again by the right he has of preserving all mankind and doing all reasonable things he can in order to that end and thus it is that every man in the state of nature has a power to kill a murderer both to deter others from doing the like injury which no reparation can compensate by the example of the punishment that attends it from everybody and also to secure men from the attempts of a criminal who having renounced reason the common rule and measure god hath given to mankind hath by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath committed upon one declared war against all mankind and therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tiger one of those wild savage beasts with whom men can have no society nor security and upon this is grounded that great law of nature whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed and cain was so fully convinced that every one had a right to destroy such a criminal that after the murder of his brother he cries out every one that findeth me shall slay me so plain was it writ in the hearts of all mankind by the same reason may a man in the state of nature punish the lesser breaches of that law it will perhaps be demanded with death i answer each transgression may be punished to that degree and with so much severity as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the offender give him cause to repent and terrify others from doing the like every offence that can be committed in the state of nature may in the state of nature be also punished equally and as far forth as it may in a commonwealth for though it would be beside my present purpose to enter here into the particulars of the law of nature or its measures of punishment yet it is certain there is such a law and that too as intelligible and plain to a rational creature and a studier of that law as the positive laws of commonwealths nay possibly plainer as much as reason is easier to be understood than the fancies and intricate contrivances of men following contrary and hidden interests put into words for truly so are a great part of the municipal laws of countries which are only so far right as they are founded on the law of nature by which they are to be regulated and interpreted to this strange doctrineviz that in the state of nature every one has the executive power of the law of naturei doubt not but it will be objected that it is unreasonable for men to be judges in their own cases that selflove will make men partial to themselves and their friends and on the other side illnature passion and revenge will carry them too far in punishing others and hence nothing but confusion and disorder will follow and that therefore god hath certainly appointed government to restrain the partiality and violence of men i easily grant that civil government is the proper remedy for the inconveniences of the state of nature which must certainly be great where men may be judges in their own case since it is easy to be imagined that he who was so unjust as to do his brother an injury will scarce be so just as to condemn himself for it but i shall desire those who make this objection to remember that absolute monarchs are but men and if government is to be the remedy of those evils which necessarily follow from men being judges in their own cases and the state of nature is therefore not to be endured i desire to know what kind of government that is and how much better it is than the state of nature where one man commanding a multitude has the liberty to be judge in his own case and may do to all his subjects whatever he pleases without the least question or control of those who execute his pleasure and in whatsoever he doth whether led by reason mistake or passion must be submitted to which men in the state of nature are not bound to do one to another and if he that judges judges amiss in his own or any other case he is answerable for it to the rest of mankind it is often asked as a mighty objection where are or ever were there any men in such a state of nature to which it may suffice as an answer at present that since all princes and rulers of independent governments all through the world are in a state of nature it is plain the world never was nor never will be without numbers of men in that state i have named all governors of independent communities whether they are or are not in league with others for it is not every compact that puts an end to the state of nature between men but only this one of agreeing together mutually to enter into one community and make one body politic other promises and compacts men may make one with another and yet still be in the state of nature the promises and bargains for truck etc between the two men in soldania in or between a swiss and an indian in the woods of america are binding to them though they are perfectly in a state of nature in reference to one another for truth and keeping of faith belongs to men as men and not as members of society to those that say there were never any men in the state of nature i will not oppose the authority of the judicious hooker eccl pol i where he says the laws which have been hitherto mentioned ie the laws of naturedo bind men absolutely even as they are men although they have never any settled fellowship never any solemn agreement amongst themselves what to do or not to do but for as much as we are not by ourselves sufficient to furnish ourselves with competent store of things needful for such a life as our nature doth desire a life fit for the dignity of man therefore to supply those defects and imperfections which are in us as living single and solely by ourselves we are naturally induced to seek communion and fellowship with others this was the cause of men uniting themselves as first in politic societies but i moreover affirm that all men are naturally in that state and remain so till by their own consents they make themselves members of some politic society and i doubt not in the sequel of this discourse to make it very clear of the state of war the state of war is a state of enmity and destruction and therefore declaring by word or action not a passionate and hasty but sedate settled design upon another mans life puts him in a state of war with him against whom he has declared such an intention and so has exposed his life to the others power to be taken away by him or any one that joins with him in his defence and espouses his quarrel it being reasonable and just i should have a right to destroy that which threatens me with destruction for by the fundamental law of nature man being to be preserved as much as possible when all cannot be preserved the safety of the innocent is to be preferred and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him or has discovered an enmity to his being for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion because they are not under the ties of the common law of reason have no other rule but that of force and violence and so may be treated as a beast of prey those dangerous and noxious creatures that will be sure to destroy him whenever he falls into their power and hence it is that he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him it being to be understood as a declaration of a design upon his life for i have reason to conclude that he who would get me into his power without my consent would use me as he pleased when he had got me there and destroy me too when he had a fancy to it for nobody can desire to have me in his absolute power unless it be to compel me by force to that which is against the right of my freedomie make me a slave to be free from such force is the only security of my preservation and reason bids me look on him as an enemy to my preservation who would take away that freedom which is the fence to it so that he who makes an attempt to enslave me thereby puts himself into a state of war with me he that in the state of nature would take away the freedom that belongs to any one in that state must necessarily be supposed to have a design to take away everything else that freedom being the foundation of all the rest as he that in the state of society would take away the freedom belonging to those of that society or commonwealth must be supposed to design to take away from them everything else and so be looked on as in a state of war this makes it lawful for a man to kill a thief who has not in the least hurt him nor declared any design upon his life any farther than by the use of force so to get him in his power as to take away his money or what he pleases from him because using force where he has no right to get me into his power let his pretence be what it will i have no reason to suppose that he who would take away my liberty would not when he had me in his power take away everything else and therefore it is lawful for me to treat him as one who has put himself into a state of war with meie kill him if i can for to that hazard does he justly expose himself whoever introduces a state of war and is aggressor in it and here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war which however some men have confounded are as far distant as a state of peace goodwill mutual assistance and preservation and a state of enmity malice violence and mutual destruction are one from another men living together according to reason without a common superior on earth with authority to judge between them is properly the state of nature but force or a declared design of force upon the person of another where there is no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief is the state of war and it is the want of such an appeal gives a man the right of war even against an aggressor though he be in society and a fellowsubject thus a thief whom i cannot harm but by appeal to the law for having stolen all that i am worth i may kill when he sets on me to rob me but of my horse or coat because the law which was made for my preservation where it cannot interpose to secure my life from present force which if lost is capable of no reparation permits me my own defence and the right of war a liberty to kill the aggressor because the aggressor allows not time to appeal to our common judge nor the decision of the law for remedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable want of a common judge with authority puts all men in a state of nature force without right upon a mans person makes a state of war both where there is and is not a common judge but when the actual force is over the state of war ceases between those that are in society and are equally on both sides subject to the judge and therefore in such controversies where the question is put who shall be judge it cannot be meant who shall decide the controversy every one knows what jephtha here tells us that the lord the judge shall judge where there is no judge on earth the appeal lies to god in heaven that question then cannot mean who shall judge whether another hath put himself in a state of war with me and whether i may as jephtha did appeal to heaven in it of that i myself can only judge in my own conscience as i will answer it at the great day to the supreme judge of all men of slavery the natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man but to have only the law of nature for his rule the liberty of man in society is to be under no other legislative power but that established by consent in the commonwealth nor under the dominion of any will or restraint of any law but what that legislative shall enact according to the trust put in it freedom then is not what sir robert filmer tells us a liberty for every one to do what he lists to live as he pleases and not to be tied by any laws but freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to every one of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not not to be subject to the inconstant uncertain unknown arbitrary will of another man as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature this freedom from absolute arbitrary power is so necessary to and closely joined with a mans preservation that he cannot part with it but by what forfeits his preservation and life together for a man not having the power of his own life cannot by compact or his own consent enslave himself to any one nor put himself under the absolute arbitrary power of another to take away his life when he pleases nobody can give more power than he has himself and he that cannot take away his own life cannot give another power over it indeed having by his fault forfeited his own life by some act that deserves death he to whom he has forfeited it may when he has him in his power delay to take it and make use of him to his own service and he does him no injury by it for whenever he finds the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life it is in his power by resisting the will of his master to draw on himself the death he desires this is the perfect condition of slavery which is nothing else but the state of war continued between a lawful conqueror and a captive for if once compact enter between them and make an agreement for a limited power on the one side and obedience on the other the state of war and slavery ceases as long as the compact endures for as has been said no man can by agreement pass over to another that which he hath not in himselfa power over his own life i confess we find among the jews as well as other nations that men did sell themselves but it is plain this was only to drudgery not to slavery for it is evident the person sold was not under an absolute arbitrary despotical power for the master could not have power to kill him at any time whom at a certain time he was obliged to let go free out of his service and the master of such a servant was so far from having an arbitrary power over his life that he could not at pleasure so much as maim him but the loss of an eye or tooth set him free exod of property whether we consider natural reason which tells us that men being once born have a right to their preservation and consequently to meat and drink and such other things as nature affords for their subsistence or revelation which gives us an account of those grants god made of the world to adam and to noah and his sons it is very clear that god as king david says psalm has given the earth to the children of men given it to mankind in common but this being supposed it seems to some a very great difficulty how any one should ever come to have a property in anything i will not content myself to answer that if it be difficult to make out property upon a supposition that god gave the world to adam and his posterity in common it is impossible that any man but one universal monarch should have any property upon a supposition that god gave the world to adam and his heirs in succession exclusive of all the rest of his posterity but i shall endeavour to show how men might come to have a property in several parts of that which god gave to mankind in common and that without any express compact of all the commoners god who hath given the world to men in common hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life and convenience the earth and all that is therein is given to men for the support and comfort of their being and though all the fruits it naturally produces and beasts it feeds belong to mankind in common as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature and nobody has originally a private dominion exclusive of the rest of mankind in any of them as they are thus in their natural state yet being given for the use of men there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other before they can be of any use or at all beneficial to any particular men the fruit or venison which nourishes the wild indian who knows no enclosure and is still a tenant in common must be his and so his ie a part of him that another can no longer have any right to it before it can do him any good for the support of his life though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men yet every man has a property in his own person this nobody has any right to but himself the labour of his body and the work of his hands we may say are properly his whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in he hath mixed his labour with it and joined to it something that is his own and thereby makes it his property it being by him removed from the common state nature placed it in it hath by this labour something annexed to it that excludes the common right of other men for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to at least where there is enough and as good left in common for others he that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood has certainly appropriated them to himself nobody can deny but the nourishment is his i ask then when did they begin to be his when he digested or when he ate or when he boiled or when he brought them home or when he picked them up and it is plain if the first gathering made them not his nothing else could that labour put a distinction between them and common that added something to them more than nature the common mother of all had done and so they became his private right and will any one say he had no right to those acorns or apples he thus appropriated because he had not the consent of all mankind to make them his was it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in common if such a consent as that was necessary man had starved notwithstanding the plenty god had given him we see in commons which remain so by compact that it is the taking any part of what is common and removing it out of the state nature leaves it in which begins the property without which the common is of no use and the taking of this or that part does not depend on the express consent of all the commoners thus the grass my horse has bit the turfs my servant has cut and the ore i have digged in any place where i have a right to them in common with others become my property without the assignation or consent of anybody the labour that was mine removing them out of that common state they were in hath fixed my property in them by making an explicit consent of every commoner necessary to any ones appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common children or servants could not cut the meat which their father or master had provided for them in common without assigning to every one his peculiar part though the water running in the fountain be every ones yet who can doubt but that in the pitcher is his only who drew it out his labour hath taken it out of the hands of nature where it was common and belonged equally to all her children and hath thereby appropriated it to himself thus this law of reason makes the deer that indians who hath killed it it is allowed to be his goods who hath bestowed his labour upon it though before it was the common right of every one and amongst those who are counted the civilised part of mankind who have made and multiplied positive laws to determine property this original law of nature for the beginning of property in what was before common still takes place and by virtue thereof what fish any one catches in the ocean that great and still remaining common of mankind or what ambergris any one takes up here is by the labour that removes it out of that common state nature left it in made his property who takes that pains about it and even amongst us the hare that any one is hunting is thought his who pursues her during the chase for being a beast that is still looked upon as common and no mans private possession whoever has employed so much labour about any of that kind as to find and pursue her has thereby removed her from the state of nature wherein she was common and hath begun a property it will perhaps be objected to this that if gathering the acorns or other fruits of the earth etc makes a right to them then any one may engross as much as he will to which i answer not so the same law of nature that does by this means give us property does also bound that property too god has given us all things richly is the voice of reason confirmed by inspiration but how far has he given it usto enjoy as much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils so much he may by his labour fix a property in whatever is beyond this is more than his share and belongs to others nothing was made by god for man to spoil or destroy and thus considering the plenty of natural provisions there was a long time in the world and the few spenders and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one man could extend itself and engross it to the prejudice of others especially keeping within the bounds set by reason of what might serve for his use there could be then little room for quarrels or contentions about property so established but the chief matter of property being now not the fruits of the earth and the beasts that subsist on it but the earth itself as that which takes in and carries with it all the rest i think it is plain that property in that too is acquired as the former as much land as a man tills plants improves cultivates and can use the product of so much is his property he by his labour does as it were enclose it from the common nor will it invalidate his right to say everybody else has an equal title to it and therefore he cannot appropriate he cannot enclose without the consent of all his fellowcommoners all mankind god when he gave the world in common to all mankind commanded man also to labour and the penury of his condition required it of him god and his reason commanded him to subdue the earthie improve it for the benefit of life and therein lay out something upon it that was his own his labour he that in obedience to this command of god subdued tilled and sowed any part of it thereby annexed to it something that was his property which another had no title to nor could without injury take from him nor was this appropriation of any parcel of land by improving it any prejudice to any other man since there was still enough and as good left and more than the yet unprovided could use so that in effect there was never the less left for others because of his enclosure for himself for he that leaves as much as another can make use of does as good as take nothing at all nobody could think himself injured by the drinking of another man though he took a good draught who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst and the case of land and water where there is enough of both is perfectly the same god gave the world to men in common but since he gave it them for their benefit and the greatest conveniencies of life they were capable to draw from it it cannot be supposed he meant it should always remain common and uncultivated he gave it to the use of the industrious and rational and labour was to be his title to it not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious he that had as good left for his improvement as was already taken up needed not complain ought not to meddle with what was already improved by anothers labour if he did it is plain he desired the benefit of anothers pains which he had no right to and not the ground which god had given him in common with others to labour on and whereof there was as good left as that already possessed and more than he knew what to do with or his industry could reach to it is true in land that is common in england or any other country where there are plenty of people under government who have money and commerce no one can enclose or appropriate any part without the consent of all his fellowcommoners because this is left common by compactie by the law of the land which is not to be violated and though it be common in respect of some men it is not so to all mankind but is the joint propriety of this country or this parish besides the remainder after such enclosure would not be as good to the rest of the commoners as the whole was when they could all make use of the whole whereas in the beginning and first peopling of the great common of the world it was quite otherwise the law man was under was rather for appropriating god commanded and his wants forced him to labour that was his property which could not be taken from him wherever he had fixed it and hence subduing or cultivating the earth and having dominion we see are joined together the one gave title to the other so that god by commanding to subdue gave authority so far to appropriate and the condition of human life which requires labour and materials to work on necessarily introduce private possessions the measure of property nature well set by the extent of mens labour and the conveniency of life no mans labour could subdue or appropriate all nor could his enjoyment consume more than a small part so that it was impossible for any man this way to entrench upon the right of another or acquire to himself a property to the prejudice of his neighbour who would still have room for as good and as large a possession after the other had taken out his as before it was appropriated which measure did confine every mans possession to a very moderate proportion and such as he might appropriate to himself without injury to anybody in the first ages of the world when men were more in danger to be lost by wandering from their company in the then vast wilderness of the earth than to be straitened for want of room to plant in the same measure may be allowed still without prejudice to anybody full as the world seems for supposing a man or family in the state they were at first peopling of the world by the children of adam or noah let him plant in some inland vacant places of america we shall find that the possessions he could make himself upon the measures we have given would not be very large nor even to this day prejudice the rest of mankind or give them reason to complain or think themselves injured by this mans encroachment though the race of men have now spread themselves to all the corners of the world and do infinitely exceed the small number was at the beginning nay the extent of ground is of so little value without labour that i have heard it affirmed that in spain itself a man may be permitted to plough sow and reap without being disturbed upon land he has no other title to but only his making use of it but on the contrary the inhabitants think themselves beholden to him who by his industry on neglected and consequently waste land has increased the stock of corn which they wanted but be this as it will which i lay no stress on this i dare boldly affirm that the same rule of proprietyviz that every man should have as much as he could make use of would hold still in the world without straitening anybody since there is land enough in the world to suffice double the inhabitants had not the invention of money and the tacit agreement of men to put a value on it introduced by consent larger possessions and a right to them which how it has done i shall by and by show more at large this is certain that in the beginning before the desire of having more than men needed had altered the intrinsic value of things which depends only on their usefulness to the life of man or had agreed that a little piece of yellow metal which would keep without wasting or decay should be worth a great piece of flesh or a whole heap of corn though men had a right to appropriate by their labour each one to himself as much of the things of nature as he could use yet this could not be much nor to the prejudice of others where the same plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry before the appropriation of land he who gathered as much of the wild fruit killed caught or tamed as many of the beasts as he could he that so employed his pains about any of the spontaneous products of nature as any way to alter them from the state nature put them in by placing any of his labour on them did thereby acquire a propriety in them but if they perished in his possession without their due useif the fruits rotted or the venison putrefied before he could spend it he offended against the common law of nature and was liable to be punished he invaded his neighbours share for he had no right farther than his use called for any of them and they might serve to afford him conveniencies of life the same measures governed the possession of land too whatsoever he tilled and reaped laid up and made use of before it spoiled that was his peculiar right whatsoever he enclosed and could feed and make use of the cattle and product was also his but if either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground or the fruit of his planting perished without gathering and laying up this part of the earth notwithstanding his enclosure was still to be looked on as waste and might be the possession of any other thus at the beginning cain might take as much ground as he could till and make it his own land and yet leave enough to abels sheep to feed on a few acres would serve for both their possessions but as families increased and industry enlarged their stocks their possessions enlarged with the need of them but yet it was commonly without any fixed property in the ground they made use of till they incorporated settled themselves together and built cities and then by consent they came in time to set out the bounds of their distinct territories and agree on limits between them and their neighbours and by laws within themselves settled the properties of those of the same society for we see that in that part of the world which was first inhabited and therefore like to be best peopled even as low down as abrahams time they wandered with their flocks and their herds which was their substance freely up and downand this abraham did in a country where he was a stranger whence it is plain that at least a great part of the land lay in common that the inhabitants valued it not nor claimed property in any more than they made use of but when there was not room enough in the same place for their herds to feed together they by consent as abraham and lot did gen xiii separated and enlarged their pasture where it best liked them and for the same reason esau went from his father and his brother and planted in mount seir gen and thus without supposing any private dominion and property in adam over all the world exclusive of all other men which can no way be proved nor any ones property be made out from it but supposing the world given as it was to the children of men in common we see how labour could make men distinct titles to several parcels of it for their private uses wherein there could be no doubt of right no room for quarrel nor is it so strange as perhaps before consideration it may appear that the property of labour should be able to overbalance the community of land for it is labour indeed that puts the difference of value on everything and let any one consider what the difference is between an acre of land planted with tobacco or sugar sown with wheat or barley and an acre of the same land lying in common without any husbandry upon it and he will find that the improvement of labour makes the far greater part of the value i think it will be but a very modest computation to say that of the products of the earth useful to the life of man ninetenths are the effects of labour nay if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use and cast up the several expenses about themwhat in them is purely owing to nature and what to labourwe shall find that in most of them ninetynine hundredths are wholly to be put on the account of labour there cannot be a clearer demonstration of anything than several nations of the americans are of this who are rich in land and poor in all the comforts of life whom nature having furnished as liberally as any other people with the materials of plentyie a fruitful soil apt to produce in abundance what might serve for food raiment and delight yet for want of improving it by labour have not one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy and a king of a large and fruitful territory there feeds lodges and is clad worse than a day labourer in england to make this a little clearer let us but trace some of the ordinary provisions of life through their several progresses before they come to our use and see how much they receive of their value from human industry bread wine and cloth are things of daily use and great plenty yet notwithstanding acorns water and leaves or skins must be our bread drink and clothing did not labour furnish us with these more useful commodities for whatever bread is more worth than acorns wine than water and cloth or silk than leaves skins or moss that is wholly owing to labour and industry the one of these being the food and raiment which unassisted nature furnishes us with the other provisions which our industry and pains prepare for us which how much they exceed the other in value when any one hath computed he will then see how much labour makes the far greatest part of the value of things we enjoy in this world and the ground which produces the materials is scarce to be reckoned in as any or at most but a very small part of it so little that even amongst us land that is left wholly to nature that hath no improvement of pasturage tillage or planting is called as indeed it is waste and we shall find the benefit of it amount to little more than nothing an acre of land that bears here twenty bushels of wheat and another in america which with the same husbandry would do the like are without doubt of the same natural intrinsic value but yet the benefit mankind receives from one in a year is worth five pounds and the other possibly not worth a penny if all the profit an indian received from it were to be valued and sold here at least i may truly say not one thousandth it is labour then which puts the greatest part of value upon land without which it would scarcely be worth anything it is to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful products for all that the straw bran bread of that acre of wheat is more worth than the product of an acre of as good land which lies waste is all the effect of labour for it is not barely the ploughmans pains the reapers and threshers toil and the bakers sweat is to be counted into the bread we eat the labour of those who broke the oxen who digged and wrought the iron and stones who felled and framed the timber employed about the plough mill oven or any other utensils which are a vast number requisite to this corn from its sowing to its being made bread must all be charged on the account of labour and received as an effect of that nature and the earth furnished only the almost worthless materials as in themselves it would be a strange catalogue of things that industry provided and made use of about every loaf of bread before it came to our use if we could trace them iron wood leather bark timber stone bricks coals lime cloth dyeingdrugs pitch tar masts ropes and all the materials made use of in the ship that brought any of the commodities made use of by any of the workmen to any part of the work all which it would be almost impossible at least too long to reckon up from all which it is evident that though the things of nature are given in common man by being master of himself and proprietor of his own person and the actions or labour of it had still in himself the great foundation of property and that which made up the great part of what he applied to the support or comfort of his being when invention and arts had improved the conveniences of life was perfectly his own and did not belong in common to others thus labour in the beginning gave a right of property wherever any one was pleased to employ it upon what was common which remained a long while the far greater part and is yet more than mankind makes use of men at first for the most part contented themselves with what unassisted nature offered to their necessities and though afterwards in some parts of the world where the increase of people and stock with the use of money had made land scarce and so of some value the several communities settled the bounds of their distinct territories and by laws within themselves regulated the properties of the private men of their society and so by compact and agreement settled the property which labour and industry began and the leagues that have been made between several states and kingdoms either expressly or tacitly disowning all claim and right to the land in the others possession have by common consent given up their pretences to their natural common right which originally they had to those countries and so have by positive agreement settled a property amongst themselves in distinct parts of the world yet there are still great tracts of ground to be found which the inhabitants thereof not having joined with the rest of mankind in the consent of the use of their common money lie waste and are more than the people who dwell on it do or can make use of and so still lie in common though this can scarce happen amongst that part of mankind that have consented to the use of money the greatest part of things really useful to the life of man and such as the necessity of subsisting made the first commoners of the world look afteras it doth the americans noware generally things of short duration such asif they are not consumed by use will decay and perish of themselves gold silver and diamonds are things that fancy or agreement hath put the value on more than real use and the necessary support of life now of those good things which nature hath provided in common every one hath a right as hath been said to as much as he could use and had a property in all he could effect with his labour all that his industry could extend to to alter from the state nature had put it in was his he that gathered a hundred bushels of acorns or apples had thereby a property in them they were his goods as soon as gathered he was only to look that he used them before they spoiled else he took more than his share and robbed others and indeed it was a foolish thing as well as dishonest to hoard up more than he could make use of if he gave away a part to anybody else so that it perished not uselessly in his possession these he also made use of and if he also bartered away plums that would have rotted in a week for nuts that would last good for his eating a whole year he did no injury he wasted not the common stock destroyed no part of the portion of goods that belonged to others so long as nothing perished uselessly in his hands again if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal pleased with its colour or exchange his sheep for shells or wool for a sparkling pebble or a diamond and keep those by him all his life he invaded not the right of others he might heap up as much of these durable things as he pleased the exceeding of the bounds of his just property not lying in the largeness of his possession but the perishing of anything uselessly in it and thus came in the use of money some lasting thing that men might keep without spoiling and that by mutual consent men would take in exchange for the truly useful but perishable supports of life and as different degrees of industry were apt to give men possessions in different proportions so this invention of money gave them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them for supposing an island separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world wherein there were but a hundred families but there were sheep horses and cows with other useful animals wholesome fruits and land enough for corn for a hundred thousand times as many but nothing in the island either because of its commonness or perishableness fit to supply the place of money what reason could any one have there to enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family and a plentiful supply to its consumption either in what their own industry produced or they could barter for like perishable useful commodities with others where there is not something both lasting and scarce and so valuable to be hoarded up there men will not be apt to enlarge their possessions of land were it never so rich never so free for them to take for i ask what would a man value ten thousand or an hundred thousand acres of excellent land ready cultivated and well stocked too with cattle in the middle of the inland parts of america where he had no hopes of commerce with other parts of the world to draw money to him by the sale of the product it would not be worth the enclosing and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature whatever was more than would supply the conveniences of life to be had there for him and his family thus in the beginning all the world was america and more so than that is now for no such thing as money was anywhere known find out something that hath the use and value of money amongst his neighbours you shall see the same man will begin presently to enlarge his possessions but since gold and silver being little useful to the life of man in proportion to food raiment and carriage has its value only from the consent of menwhereof labour yet makes in great part the measure it is plain that the consent of men have agreed to a disproportionate and unequal possession of the earthi mean out of the bounds of society and compact for in governments the laws regulate it they having by consent found out and agreed in a way how a man may rightfully and without injury possess more than he himself can make use of by receiving gold and silver which may continue long in a mans possession without decaying for the overplus and agreeing those metals should have a value and thus i think it is very easy to conceive without any difficulty how labour could at first begin a title of property in the common things of nature and how the spending it upon our uses bounded it so that there could then be no reason of quarrelling about title nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it gave right and conveniency went together for as a man had a right to all he could employ his labour upon so he had no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of this left no room for controversy about the title nor for encroachment on the right of others what portion a man carved to himself was easily seen and it was useless as well as dishonest to carve himself too much or take more than he needed i of paternal power it may perhaps be censured an impertinent criticism in a discourse of this nature to find fault with words and names that have obtained in the world and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new ones when the old are apt to lead men into mistakes as this of paternal power probably has done which seems so to place the power of parents over their children wholly in the father as if the mother had no share in it whereas if we consult reason or revelation we shall find she has an equal title which may give one reason to ask whether this might not be more properly called parental power for whatever obligation nature and the right of generation lays on children it must certainly bind them equal to both the concurrent causes of it and accordingly we see the positive law of god everywhere joins them together without distinction when it commands the obedience of children honour thy father and thy mother exod whosoever curseth his father or his mother lev ye shall fear every man his mother and his father lev children obey your parents eph etc is the style of the old and new testament had but this one thing been well considered without looking any deeper into the matter it might perhaps have kept men from running into those gross mistakes they have made about this power of parents which however it might without any great harshness bear the name of absolute dominion and regal authority when under the title of paternal power it seemed appropriated to the father would yet have sounded but oddly and in the very name shown the absurdity if this supposed absolute power over children had been called parental and thereby discovered that it belonged to the mother too for it will but very ill serve the turn of those men who contend so much for the absolute power and authority of the fatherhood as they call it that the mother should have any share in it and it would have but ill supported the monarchy they contend for when by the very name it appeared that that fundamental authority from whence they would derive their government of a single person only was not placed in one but two persons jointly but to let this of names pass though i have said above that all men by nature are equal i cannot be supposed to understand all sorts of equality age or virtue may give men a just precedency excellency of parts and merit may place others above the common level birth may subject some and alliance or benefits others to pay an observance to those to whom nature gratitude or other respects may have made it due and yet all this consists with the equality which all men are in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another which was the equality i there spoke of as proper to the business in hand being that equal right that every man hath to his natural freedom without being subjected to the will or authority of any other man children i confess are not born in this full state of equality though they are born to it their parents have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it is but a temporary one the bonds of this subjection are like the swaddling clothes they are wrapt up in and supported by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a man at his own free disposal adam was created a perfect man his body and mind in full possession of their strength and reason and so was capable from the first instance of his being to provide for his own support and preservation and govern his actions according to the dictates of the law of reason god had implanted in him from him the world is peopled with his descendants who are all born infants weak and helpless without knowledge or understanding but to supply the defects of this imperfect state till the improvement of growth and age had removed them adam and eve and after them all parents were by the law of nature under an obligation to preserve nourish and educate the children they had begotten not as their own workmanship but the workmanship of their own maker the almighty to whom they were to be accountable for them the law that was to govern adam was the same that was to govern all his posterity the law of reason but his offspring having another way of entrance into the world different from him by a natural birth that produced them ignorant and without the use of reason they were not presently under that law for nobody can be under a law that is not promulgated to him and this law being promulgated or made known by reason only he that is not come to the use of his reason cannot be said to be under this law and adams children being not presently as soon as born under this law of reason were not presently free for law in its true notion is not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper interest and prescribes no farther than is for the general good of those under that law could they be happier without it the law as a useless thing would of itself vanish and that ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and precipices so that however it may be mistaken the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the states of created beings capable of laws where there is no law there is no freedom for liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others which cannot be where there is no law and is not as we are told a liberty for every man to do what he lists for who could be free when every other mans humour might domineer over him but a liberty to dispose and order freely as he lists his person actions possessions and his whole property within the allowance of those laws under which he is and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another but freely follow his own the power then that parents have over their children arises from that duty which is incumbent on them to take care of their offspring during the imperfect state of childhood to inform the mind and govern the actions of their yet ignorant nonage till reason shall take its place and ease them of that trouble is what the children want and the parents are bound to for god having given man an understanding to direct his actions has allowed him a freedom of will and liberty of acting as properly belonging thereunto within the bounds of that law he is under but whilst he is in an estate wherein he has no understanding of his own to direct his will he is not to have any will of his own to follow he that understands for him must will for him too he must prescribe to his will and regulate his actions but when he comes to the estate that made his father a free man the son is a free man too this holds in all the laws a man is under whether natural or civil is a man under the law of nature what made him free of that law what gave him a free disposing of his property according to his own will within the compass of that law i answer an estate wherein he might be supposed capable to know that law that so he might keep his actions within the bounds of it when he has acquired that state he is presumed to know how far that law is to be his guide and how far he may make use of his freedom and so comes to have it till then somebody else must guide him who is presumed to know how far the law allows a liberty if such a state of reason such an age of discretion made him free the same shall make his son free too is a man under the law of england what made him free of that lawthat is to have the liberty to dispose of his actions and possessions according to his own will within the permission of that law a capacity of knowing that law which is supposed by that law at the age of twentyone and in some cases sooner if this made the father free it shall make the son free too till then we see the law allows the son to have no will but he is to be guided by the will of his father or guardian who is to understand for him and if the father die and fail to substitute a deputy in this trust if he hath not provided a tutor to govern his son during his minority during his want of understanding the law takes care to do it some other must govern him and be a will to him till he hath attained to a state of freedom and his understanding be fit to take the government of his will but after that the father and son are equally free as much as tutor and pupil after nonage equally subjects of the same law together without any dominion left in the father over the life liberty or estate of his son whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature or under the positive laws of an established government but if through defects that may happen out of the ordinary course of nature any one comes not to such a degree of reason wherein he might be supposed capable of knowing the law and so living within the rules of it he is never capable of being a free man he is never let loose to the disposure of his own will because he knows no bounds to it has not understanding its proper guide but is continued under the tuition and government of others all the time his own understanding is inca pable of that charge and so lunatics and idiots are never set free from the government of their parents children who are not as yet come unto those years whereat they may have and innocents which are excluded by a natural defect from ever having thirdly madmen which for the present cannot possibly have the use of right reason to guide themselves have for their guide the reason that guideth other men which are tutors over them to seek and procure their good for them says hooker eccl pol lib i s all which seems no more than that duty which god and nature has laid on man as well as other creatures to preserve their offspring till they can be able to shift for themselves and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of parents regal authority thus we are born free as we are born rational not that we have actually the exercise of either age that brings one brings with it the other too and thus we see how natural freedom and subjection to parents may consist together and are both founded on the same principle a child is free by his fathers title by his fathers understanding which is to govern him till he hath it of his own the freedom of a man at years of discretion and the subjection of a child to his parents whilst yet short of it are so consistent and so distinguishable that the most blinded contenders for monarchy by right of fatherhood cannot miss of it the most obstinate cannot but allow of it for were their doctrine all true were the right heir of adam now known and by that title settled a monarch in his throne invested with all the absolute unlimited power sir robert filmer talks of if he should die as soon as his heir were born must not the child notwithstanding he were never so free never so much sovereign be in subjection to his mother and nurse to tutors and governors till age and education brought him reason and ability to govern himself and others the necessities of his life the health of his body and the information of his mind would require him to be directed by the will of others and not his own and yet will any one think that this restraint and subjection were inconsistent with or spoiled him of that liberty or sovereignty he had a right to or gave away his empire to those who had the government of his nonage this government over him only prepared him the better and sooner for it if anybody should ask me when my son is of age to be free i shall answer just when his monarch is of age to govern but at what time says the judicious hooker eccl pol lib i s a man may be said to have attained so far forth the use of reason as sufficeth to make him capable of those laws whereby he is then bound to guide his actions this is a great deal more easy for sense to discern than for any one by skill and learning to determine commonwealths themselves take notice of and allow that there is a time when men are to begin to act like free men and therefore till that time require not oaths of fealty or allegiance or other public owning of or submission to the government of their countries the freedom then of man and liberty of acting according to his own will is grounded on his having reason which is able to instruct him in that law he is to govern himself by and make him know how far he is left to the freedom of his own will to turn him loose to an unrestrained liberty before he has reason to guide him is not the allowing him the privilege of his nature to be free but to thrust him out amongst brutes and abandon him to a state as wretched and as much beneath that of a man as theirs this is that which puts the authority into the parents hands to govern the minority of their children god hath made it their business to employ this care on their offspring and hath placed in them suitable inclinations of tenderness and concern to temper this power to apply it as his wisdom designed it to the childrens good as long as they should need to be under it but what reason can hence advance this care of the parents due to their offspring into an absolute arbitrary dominion of the father whose power reaches no farther than by such a discipline as he finds most effectual to give such strength and health to their bodies such vigour and rectitude to their minds as may best fit his children to be most useful to themselves and others and if it be necessary to his condition to make them work when they are able for their own subsistence but in this power the mother too has her share with the father nay this power so little belongs to the father by any peculiar right of nature but only as he is guardian of his children that when he quits his care of them he loses his power over them which goes along with their nourishment and education to which it is inseparably annexed and belongs as much to the fosterfather of an exposed child as to the natural father of another so little power does the bare act of begetting give a man over his issue if all his care ends there and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority of a father and what will become of this paternal power in that part of the world where one woman hath more than one husband at a time or in those parts of america where when the husband and wife part which happens frequently the children are all left to the mother follow her and are wholly under her care and provision and if the father die whilst the children are young do they not naturally everywhere owe the same obedience to their mother during their minority as to their father were he alive and will any one say that the mother hath a legislative power over her children that she can make standing rules which shall be of perpetual obligation by which they ought to regulate all the concerns of their property and bound their liberty all the course of their lives and enforce the observation of them with capital punishments for this is the proper power of the magistrate of which the father hath not so much as the shadow his command over his children is but temporary and reaches not their life or property it is but a help to the weakness and imperfection of their nonage a discipline necessary to their education and though a father may dispose of his own possessions as he pleases when his children are out of danger of perishing for want yet his power extends not to the lives or goods which either their own industry or anothers bounty has made theirs nor to their liberty neither when they are once arrived to the enfranchisement of the years of discretion the fathers empire then ceases and he can from thenceforward no more dispose of the liberty of his son than that of any other man and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdiction from which a man may withdraw himself having licence from divine authority to leave father and mother and cleave to his wife but though there be a time when a child comes to be as free from subjection to the will and command of his father as he himself is free from subjection to the will of anybody else and they are both under no other restraint but that which is common to them both whether it be the law of nature or municipal law of their country yet this freedom exempts not a son from that honour which he ought by the law of god and nature to pay his parents god having made the parents instruments in his great design of continuing the race of mankind and the occasions of life to their children as he hath laid on them an obligation to nourish preserve and bring up their offspring so he has laid on the children a perpetual obligation of honouring their parents which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be shown by all outward expressions ties up the child from anything that may ever injure or affront disturb or endanger the happiness or life of those from whom he received his and engages him in all actions of defence relief assistance and comfort of those by whose means he entered into being and has been made capable of any enjoyments of life from this obligation no state no freedom can absolve children but this is very far from giving parents a power of command over their children or an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their lives or liberties it is one thing to owe honour respect gratitude and assistance another to require an absolute obedience and submission the honour due to parents a monarch on his throne owes his mother and yet this lessens not his authority nor subjects him to her government the subjection of a minor places in the father a temporary government which terminates with the minority of the child and the honour due from a child places in the parents a perpetual right to respect reverence support and compliance to more or less as the fathers care cost and kindness in his education has been more or less and this ends not with minority but holds in all parts and conditions of a mans life the want of distinguishing these two powers which the father hath in the right of tuition during minority and the right of honour all his life may perhaps have caused a great part of the mistakes about this matter for to speak properly of them the first of these is rather the privilege of children and duty of parents than any prerogative of paternal power the nourishment and education of their children is a charge so incumbent on parents for their childrens good that nothing can absolve them from taking care of it and though the power of commanding and chastising them go along with it yet god hath woven into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for their offspring that there is little fear that parents should use their power with too much rigour the excess is seldom on the severe side the strong bias of nature drawing the other way and therefore god almighty when he would express his gentle dealing with the israelites he tells them that though he chastened them he chastened them as a man chastens his son deut ie with tenderness and affection and kept them under no severer discipline than what was absolutely best for them and had been less kindness to have slackened this is that power to which children are commanded obedience that the pains and care of their parents may not be increased or illrewarded on the other side honour and support all that which gratitude requires to return for the benefits received by and from them is the indispensable duty of the child and the proper privilege of the parents this is intended for the parents advantage as the other is for the childs though education the parents duty seems to have most power because the ignorance and infirmities of childhood stand in need of restraint and correction which is a visible exercise of rule and a kind of dominion and that duty which is comprehended in the word honour requires less obedience though the obligation be stronger on grown than younger children for who can think the command children obey your parents requires in a man that has children of his own the same submission to his father as it does in his yet young children to him and that by this precept he were bound to obey all his fathers commands if out of a conceit of authority he should have the indiscretion to treat him still as a boy the first part then of paternal power or rather duty which is education belongs so to the father that it terminates at a certain season when the business of education is over it ceases of itself and is also alienable before for a man may put the tuition of his son in other hands and he that has made his son an apprentice to another has discharged him during that time of a great part of his obedience both to himself and to his mother but all the duty of honour the other part remains nevertheless entire to them nothing can cancel that it is so inseparable from them both that the fathers authority cannot dispossess the mother of this right nor can any man discharge his son from honouring her that bore him but both these are very far from a power to make laws and enforcing them with penalties that may reach estate liberty limbs and life the power of commanding ends with nonage and though after that honour and respect support and defence and whatsoever gratitude can oblige a man to for the highest benefits he is naturally capable of be always due from a son to his parents yet all this puts no sceptre into the fathers hand no sovereign power of commanding he has no dominion over his sons property or actions nor any right that his will should prescribe to his sons in all things however it may become his son in many things not very inconvenient to him and his family to pay a deference to it a man may owe honour and respect to an ancient or wise man defence to his child or friend relief and support to the distressed and gratitude to a benefactor to such a degree that all he has all he can do cannot sufficiently pay it but all these give no authority no right of making laws to any one over him from whom they are owing and it is plain all this is due not to the bare title of father not only because as has been said it is owing to the mother too but because these obligations to parents and the degrees of what is required of children may be varied by the different care and kindness trouble and expense is often employed upon one child more than another this shows the reason how it comes to pass that parents in societies where they themselves are subjects retain a power over their children and have as much right to their subjection as those who are in the state of nature which could not possibly be if all political power were only paternal and that in truth they were one and the same thing for then all paternal power being in the prince the subject could naturally have none of it but these two powers political and paternal are so perfectly distinct and separate and built upon so different foundations and given to so different ends that every subject that is a father has as much a paternal power over his children as the prince has over his and every prince that has parents owes them as much filial duty and obedience as the meanest of his subjects do to theirs and can therefore contain not any part or degree of that kind of dominion which a prince or magistrate has over his subject though the obligation on the parents to bring up their children and the obligation on children to honour their parents contain all the power on the one hand and submission on the other which are proper to this relation yet there is another power ordinarily in the father whereby he has a tie on the obedience of his children which though it be common to him with other men yet the occasions of showing it almost constantly happening to fathers in their private families and in instances of it elsewhere being rare and less taken notice of it passes in the world for a part of paternal jurisdiction and this is the power men generally have to bestow their estates on those who please them best the possession of the father being the expectation and inheritance of the children ordinarily in certain proportions according to the law and custom of each country yet it is commonly in the fathers power to bestow it with a more sparing or liberal hand according as the behaviour of this or that child hath comported with his will and humour this is no small tie to the obedience of children and there being always annexed to the enjoyment of land a submission to the government of the country of which that land is a part it has been commonly supposed that a father could oblige his posterity to that government of which he himself was a subject that his compact held them whereas it being only a necessary condition annexed to the land which is under that government reaches only those who will take it on that condition and so is no natural tie or engagement but a voluntary submission for every mans children being by nature as free as himself or any of his ancestors ever were may whilst they are in that freedom choose what society they will join themselves to what commonwealth they will put themselves under but if they will enjoy the inheritance of their ancestors they must take it on the same terms their ancestors had it and submit to all the conditions annexed to such a possession by this power indeed fathers oblige their children to obedience to themselves even when they are past minority and most commonly too subject them to this or that political power but neither of these by any peculiar right of fatherhood but by the reward they have in their hands to enforce and recompense such a compliance and is no more power than what a frenchman has over an englishman who by the hopes of an estate he will leave him will certainly have a strong tie on his obedience and if when it is left him he will enjoy it he must certainly take it upon the conditions annexed to the possession of land in that country where it lies whether it be france or england to conclude then though the fathers power of commanding extends no farther than the minority of his children and to a degree only fit for the discipline and government of that age and though that honour and respect and all that which the latins called piety which they indispensably owe to their parents all their lifetime and in all estates with all that support and defence is due to them gives the father no power of governingie making laws and exacting penalties on his children though by this he has no dominion over the property or actions of his son yet it is obvious to conceive how easy it was in the first ages of the world and in places still where the thinness of people gives families leave to separate into unpossessed quarters and they have room to remove and plant themselves in yet vacant habitations for the father of the family to become the prince of it he had been a ruler from the beginning of the infancy of his children and when they were grown up since without some government it would be hard for them to live together it was likeliest it should by the express or tacit consent of the children be in the father where it seemed without any change barely to continue and when indeed nothing more was required to it than the permitting the father to exercise alone in his family that executive power of the law of nature which every free man naturally hath and by that permission resigning up to him a monarchical power whilst they remained in it but that this was not by any paternal right but only by the consent of his children is evident from hence that nobody doubts but if a stranger whom chance or business had brought to his family had there killed any of his children or committed any other act he might condemn and put him to death or otherwise have punished him as well as any of his children which was impossible he should do by virtue of any paternal authority over one who was not his child but by virtue of that executive power of the law of nature which as a man he had a right to and he alone could punish him in his family where the respect of his children had laid by the exercise of such a power to give way to the dignity and authority they were willing should remain in him above the rest of his family thus it was easy and almost natural for children by a tacit and almost natural consent to make way for the fathers authority and government they had been accustomed in their childhood to follow his direction and to refer their little differences to him and when they were men who was fitter to rule them their little properties and less covetousness seldom afforded greater controversies and when any should arise where could they have a fitter umpire than he by whose care they had every one been sustained and brought up and who had a tenderness for them all it is no wonder that they made no distinction betwixt minority and full age nor looked after oneandtwenty or any other age that might make them the free disposers of themselves and fortunes when they could have no desire to be out of their pupilage the government they had been under during it continued still to be more their protection than restraint and they could nowhere find a greater security to their peace liberties and fortunes than in the rule of a father thus the natural fathers of families by an insensible change became the politic monarchs of them too and as they chanced to live long and leave able and worthy heirs for several successions or otherwise so they laid the foundations of hereditary or elective kingdoms under several constitutions and manors according as chance contrivance or occasions happened to mould them but if princes have their titles in the fathers right and it be a sufficient proof of the natural right of fathers to political authority because they commonly were those in whose hands we find de facto the exercise of government i say if this argument be good it will as strongly prove that all princes nay princes only ought to be priests since it is as certain that in the beginning the father of the family was priest as that he was ruler in his own household ii of political or civil society god having made man such a creature that in his own judgment it was not good for him to be alone put him under strong obligations of necessity convenience and inclination to drive him into society as well as fitted him with understanding and language to continue and enjoy it the first society was between man and wife which gave beginning to that between parents and children to which in time that between master and servant came to be added and though all these might and commonly did meet together and make up but one family wherein the master or mistress of it had some sort of rule proper to a family each of these or all together came short of political society as we shall see if we consider the different ends ties and bounds of each of these conjugal society is made by a voluntary compact between man and woman and though it consist chiefly in such a communion and right in one anothers bodies as is necessary to its chief end procreation yet it draws with it mutual support and assistance and a communion of interests too as necessary not only to unite their care and affection but also necessary to their common offspring who have a right to be nourished and maintained by them till they are able to provide for themselves for the end of conjunction between male and female being not barely procreation but the continuation of the species this conjunction betwixt male and female ought to last even after procreation so long as is necessary to the nourishment and support of the young ones who are to be sustained by those that got them till they are able to shift and provide for themselves this rule which the infinite wise maker hath set to the works of his hands we find the inferior creatures steadily obey in those vivaporous animals which feed on grass the conjunction between male and female lasts no longer than the very act of copulation because the teat of the dam being sufficient to nourish the young till it be able to feed on grass the male only begets but concerns not himself for the female or young to whose sustenance he can contribute nothing but in beasts of prey the conjunction lasts longer because the dam not being able well to subsist herself and nourish her numerous offspring by her own prey alone a more laborious as well as more dangerous way of living than by feeding on grass the assistance of the male is necessary to the maintenance of their common family which cannot subsist till they are able to prey for themselves but by the joint care of male and female the same is observed in all birds except some domestic ones where plenty of food excuses the cock from feeding and taking care of the young brood whose young needing food in the nest the cock and hen continue mates till the young are able to use their wings and provide for themselves and herein i think lies the chief if not the only reason why the male and female in mankind are tied to a longer conjunction than other creaturesviz because the female is capable of conceiving and de facto is commonly with child again and brings forth too a new birth long before the former is out of a dependency for support on his parents help and able to shift for himself and has all the assistance due to him from his parents whereby the father who is bound to take care for those he hath begot is under an obligation to continue in conjugal society with the same woman longer than other creatures whose young being able to subsist of themselves before the time of procreation returns again the conjugal bond dissolves of itself and they are at liberty till hymen at his usual anniversary season summons them again to choose new mates wherein one cannot but admire the wisdom of the great creator who having given to man an ability to lay up for the future as well as supply the present necessity hath made it necessary that society of man and wife should be more lasting than of male and female amongst other creatures that so their industry might be encouraged and their interest better united to make provision and lay up goods for their common issue which uncertain mixture or easy and frequent solutions of conjugal society would mightily disturb but though these are ties upon mankind which make the conjugal bonds more firm and lasting in a man than the other species of animals yet it would give one reason to inquire why this compact where procreation and education are secured and inheritance taken care for may not be made determinable either by consent or at a certain time or upon certain conditions as well as any other voluntary compacts there being no necessity in the nature of the thing nor to the ends of it that it should always be for lifei mean to such as are under no restraint of any positive law which ordains all such contracts to be perpetual but the husband and wife though they have but one common concern yet having different understandings will unavoidably sometimes have different wills too it therefore being necessary that the last determination ie the rule should be placed somewhere it naturally falls to the mans share as the abler and the stronger but this reaching but to the things of their common interest and property leaves the wife in the full and true possession of what by contract is her peculiar right and at least gives the husband no more power over her than she has over his life the power of the husband being so far from that of an absolute monarch that the wife has in many cases a liberty to separate from him where natural right or their contract allows it whether that contract be made by themselves in the state of nature or by the customs or laws of the country they live in and the children upon such separation fall to the father or mothers lot as such contract does determine for all the ends of marriage being to be obtained under politic government as well as in the state of nature the civil magistrate doth not abridge the right or power of either naturally necessary to those endsviz procreation and mutual support and assistance whilst they are together but only decides any controversy that may arise between man and wife about them if it were otherwise and that absolute sovereignty and power of life and death naturally belonged to the husband and were necessary to the society between man and wife there could be no matrimony in any of these countries where the husband is allowed no such absolute authority but the ends of matrimony requiring no such power in the husband it was not at all necessary to it the condition of conjugal society put it not in him but whatsoever might consist with procreation and support of the children till they could shift for themselvesmutual assistance comfort and maintenancemight be varied and regulated by that contract which first united them in that society nothing being necessary to any society that is not necessary to the ends for which it is made the society betwixt parents and children and the distinct rights and powers belonging respectively to them i have treated of so largely in the foregoing chapter that i shall not here need to say anything of it and i think it is plain that it is far different from a politic society master and servant are names as old as history but given to those of far different condition for a free man makes himself a servant to another by selling him for a certain time the service he undertakes to do in exchange for wages he is to receive and though this commonly puts him into the family of his master and under the ordinary discipline thereof yet it gives the master but a temporary power over him and no greater than what is contained in the contract between them but there is another sort of servant which by a peculiar name we call slaves who being captives taken in a just war are by the right of nature subjected to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power of their masters these men having as i say forfeited their lives and with it their liberties and lost their estates and being in the state of slavery not capable of any property cannot in that state be considered as any part of civil society the chief end whereof is the preservation of property let us therefore consider a master of a family with all these subordinate relations of wife children servants and slaves united under the domestic rule of a family with what resemblance soever it may have in its order offices and number too with a little commonwealth yet is very far from it both in its constitution power and end or if it must be thought a monarchy and the paterfamilias the absolute monarch in it absolute monarchy will have but a very shattered and short power when it is plain by what has been said before that the master of the family has a very distinct and differently limited power both as to time and extent over those several persons that are in it for excepting the slave and the family is as much a family and his power as paterfamilias as great whether there be any slaves in his family or no he has no legislative power of life and death over any of them and none too but what a mistress of a family may have as well as he and he certainly can have no absolute power over the whole family who has but a very limited one over every individual in it but how a family or any other society of men differ from that which is properly political society we shall best see by considering wherein political society itself consists man being born as has been proved with a title to perfect freedom and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the law of nature equally with any other man or number of men in the world hath by nature a power not only to preserve his property that is his life liberty and estate against the injuries and attempts of other men but to judge of and punish the breaches of that law in others as he is persuaded the offence deserves even with death itself in crimes where the heinousness of the fact in his opinion requires it but because no political society can be nor subsist without having in itself the power to preserve the property and in order thereunto punish the offences of all those of that society there and there only is political society where every one of the members hath quitted this natural power resigned it up into the hands of the community in all cases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law established by it and thus all private judgment of every particular member being excluded the community comes to be umpire and by understanding indifferent rules and men authorised by the community for their execution decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concerning any matter of right and punishes those offences which any member hath committed against the society with such penalties as the law has established whereby it is easy to discern who are and are not in political society together those who are united into one body and have a common established law and judicature to appeal to with authority to decide controversies between them and punish offenders are in civil society one with another but those who have no such common appeal i mean on earth are still in the state of nature each being where there is no other judge for himself and executioner which is as i have before showed it the perfect state of nature and thus the commonwealth comes by a power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several transgressions they think worthy of it committed amongst the members of that society which is the power of making laws as well as it has the power to punish any injury done unto any of its members by any one that is not of it which is the power of war and peace and all this for the preservation of the property of all the members of that society as far as is possible but though every man entered into society has quitted his power to punish offences against the law of nature in prosecution of his own private judgment yet with the judgment of offences which he has given up to the legislative in all cases where he can appeal to the magistrate he has given up a right to the commonwealth to employ his force for the execution of the judgments of the commonwealth whenever he shall be called to it which indeed are his own judgements they being made by himself or his representative and herein we have the original of the legislative and executive power of civil society which is to judge by standing laws how far offences are to be punished when committed within the commonwealth and also by occasional judgments founded on the present circumstances of the fact how far injuries from without are to be vindicated and in both these to employ all the force of all the members when there shall be need wherever therefore any number of men so unite into one society as to quit every one his executive power of the law of nature and to resign it to the public there and there only is a political or civil society and this is done wherever any number of men in the state of nature enter into society to make one people one body politic under one supreme government or else when any one joins himself to and incorpo rates with any government already made for hereby he authorises the society or which is all one the legislative thereof to make laws for him as the public good of the society shall require to the execution whereof his own assistance as to his own decrees is due and this puts men out of a state of nature into that of a commonwealth by setting up a judge on earth with authority to determine all the controversies and redress the injuries that may happen to any member of the commonwealth which judge is the legislative or magistrates appointed by it and wherever there are any number of men however associated that have no such decisive power to appeal to there they are still in the state of nature and hence it is evident that absolute monarchy which by some men is counted for the only government in the world is indeed inconsistent with civil society and so can be not form of civil government at all for the end of civil society being to avoid and remedy those inconveniences of the state of nature which necessarily follow from every mans being judge in his own case by setting up a known authority to which every one of that society may appeal upon any injury received or controversy that may arise and which every one of the society ought to obey wherever any persons are who have not such an authority to appeal to and decide any difference between them there those persons are still in the state of nature and so is every absolute prince in respect of those who are under his dominion for he being supposed to have all both legislative and executive power in himself alone there is no judge to be found no appeal lies open to any one who may fairly and indifferently and with authority decide and from whence relief and redress may be expected of any injury or inconveniency that may be suffered from him or by his order so that such a man however entitled czar or grand signior or how you please is as much in the state of nature with all under his dominion as he is with the rest of mankind for wherever any two men are who have no standing rule and common judge to appeal to on earth for the determination of controversies of right betwixt them there they are still in the state of nature and under all the inconveniencies of it with only this woeful difference to the subject or rather slave of an absolute prince that whereas in the ordinary state of nature he has a liberty to judge of his right according to the best of his power to maintain it but whenever his property is invaded by the will and order of his monarch he has not only no appeal as those in society ought to have but as if he were degraded from the common state of rational creatures is denied a liberty to judge of or defend his right and so is exposed to all the misery and inconveniencies that a man can fear from one who being in the unrestrained state of nature is yet corrupted with flattery and armed with power for he that thinks absolute power purifies mens blood and corrects the baseness of human nature need read but the history of this or any other age to be convinced to the contrary he that would have been insolent and injurious in the woods of america would not probably be much better on a throne where perhaps learning and religion shall be found out to justify all that he shall do to his subjects and the sword presently silence all those that dare question it for what the protection of absolute monarchy is what kind of fathers of their countries it makes princes to be and to what a degree of happiness and security it carries civil society where this sort of government is grown to perfection he that will look into the late relation of ceylon may easily see in absolute monarchies indeed as well as other governments of the world the subjects have an appeal to the law and judges to decide any controversies and restrain any violence that may happen betwixt the subjects themselves one amongst another this every one thinks necessary and believes he deserves to be thought a declared enemy to society and mankind who should go about to take it away but whether this be from a true love of mankind and society and such a charity as we owe all one to another there is reason to doubt for this is no more than what every man who loves his own power profit or greatness may and naturally must do keep those animals from hurting or destroying one another who labour and drudge only for his pleasure and advantage and so are taken care of not out of any love the master has for them but love of himself and the profit they bring him for if it be asked what security what fence is there in such a state against the violence and oppression of this absolute ruler the very question can scarce be borne they are ready to tell you that it deserves death only to ask after safety betwixt subject and subject they will grant there must be measures laws and judges for their mutual peace and security but as for the ruler he ought to be absolute and is above all such circumstances because he has a power to do more hurt and wrong it is right when he does it to ask how you may be guarded from or injury on that side where the strongest hand is to do it is presently the voice of faction and rebellion as if when men quitting the state of nature entered into society they agreed that all of them but one should be under the restraint of laws but that he should still retain all the liberty of the state of nature increased with power and made licentious by impunity this is to think that men are so foolish that they take care to avoid what mischiefs may be done them by polecats or foxes but are content nay think it safety to be devoured by lions but whatever flatterers may talk to amuse peoples understandings it never hinders men from feeling and when they perceive that any man in what station soever is out of the bounds of the civil society they are of and that they have no appeal on earth against any harm they may receive from him they are apt to think themselves in the state of nature in respect of him whom they find to be so and to take care as soon as they can to have that safety and security in civil society for which it was first instituted and for which only they entered into it and therefore though perhaps at first as shall be showed more at large hereafter in the following part of this discourse some one good and excellent man having got a preeminency amongst the rest had this deference paid to his goodness and virtue as to a kind of natural authority that the chief rule with arbitration of their differences by a tacit consent devolved into his hands without any other caution but the assurance they had of his uprightness and wisdom yet when time giving authority and as some men would persuade us sacredness to customs which the negligent and unforeseeing innocence of the first ages began had brought in successors of another stamp the people finding their properties not secure under the government as then it was whereas government has no other end but the preservation of property could never be safe nor at rest nor think themselves in civil society till the legislative was so placed in collective bodies of men call them senate parliament or what you please by which means every single person became subject equally with other the meanest men to those laws which he himself as part of the legislative had established nor could any one by his own authority avoid the force of the law when once made nor by any pretence of superiority plead exemption thereby to license his own or the miscarriages of any of his dependants no man in civil society can be exempted from the laws of it for if any man may do what he thinks fit and there be no appeal on earth for redress or security against any harm he shall do i ask whether he be not perfectly still in the state of nature and so can be no part or member of that civil society unless any one will say the state of nature and civil society are one and the same thing which i have never yet found any one so great a patron of anarchy as to affirm iii of the beginning of political societies men being as has been said by nature all free equal and independent no one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the political power of another without his own consent which is done by agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community for their comfortable safe and peaceable living one amongst another in a secure enjoyment of their properties and a greater security against any that are not of it this any number of men may do because it injures not the freedom of the rest they are left as they were in the liberty of the state of nature when any number of men have so consented to make one community or government they are thereby presently incorporated and make one body politic wherein the majority have a right to act and conclude the rest for when any number of men have by the consent of every individual made a community they have thereby made that community one body with a power to act as one body which is only by the will and determination of the majority for that which acts any community being only the consent of the individuals of it and it being one body must move one way it is necessary the body should move that way whither the greater force carries it which is the consent of the majority or else it is impossible it should act or continue one body one community which the consent of every individual that united into it agreed that it should and so every one is bound by that consent to be concluded by the majority and therefore we see that in assemblies empowered to act by positive laws where no number is set by that positive law which empowers them the act of the majority passes for the act of the whole and of course determines as having by the law of nature and reason the power of the whole and thus every man by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government puts himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the determination of the majority and to be concluded by it or else this original compact whereby he with others incorporates into one society would signify nothing and be no compact if he be left free and under no other ties than he was in before in the state of nature for what appearance would there be of any compact what new engagement if he were no farther tied by any decrees of the society than he himself thought fit and did actually consent to this would be still as great a liberty as he himself had before his compact or any one else in the state of nature who may submit himself and consent to any acts of it if he thinks fit for if the consent of the majority shall not in reason be received as the act of the whole and conclude every individual nothing but the consent of every individual can make anything to be the act of the whole which considering the infirmities of health and avocations of business which in a number though much less than that of a commonwealth will necessarily keep many away from the public assembly and the variety of opinions and contrariety of interests which unavoidably happen in all collections of men it is next impossible ever to be had and therefore if coming into society be upon such terms it will be only like catos coming into the theatre tantum ut exiret such a constitution as this would make the mighty leviathan of a shorter duration than the feeblest creatures and not let it outlast the day it was born in which cannot be supposed till we can think that rational creatures should desire and constitute societies only to be dissolved for where the majority cannot conclude the rest there they cannot act as one body and consequently will be immediately dissolved again whosoever therefore out of a state of nature unite into a community must be understood to give up all the power necessary to the ends for which they unite into society to the majority of the community unless they expressly agreed in any number greater than the majority and this is done by barely agreeing to unite into one political society which is all the compact that is or needs be between the individuals that enter into or make up a commonwealth and thus that which begins and actually constitutes any political society is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of majority to unite and incorporate into such a society and this is that and that only which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world to this i find two objections made that there are no instances to be found in story of a company of men independent and equal one amongst another that met together and in this way began and set up a government it is impossible of right that men should do so because all men being born under government they are to submit to that and are not at liberty to begin a new one to the first there is this to answer that it is not at all to be wondered that history gives us but a very little account of men that lived together in the state of nature the inconveniencies of that condition and the love and want of society no sooner brought any number of them together but they presently united and in corporated if they designed to continue together and if we may not suppose men ever to have been in the state of nature because we hear not much of them in such a state we may as well suppose the armies of salmanasser or xerxes were never children because we hear little of them till they were men and embodied in armies government is everywhere antecedent to records and letters seldom come in amongst a people till a long continuation of civil society has by other more necessary arts provided for their safety ease and plenty and then they begin to look after the history of their founders and search into their original when they have outlived the memory of it for it is with commonwealths as with particular persons they are commonly ignorant of their own births and infancies and if they know anything of it they are beholding for it to the accidental records that others have kept of it and those that we have of the beginning of any polities in the world excepting that of the jews where god himself immediately interposed and which favours not at all paternal dominion are all either plain instances of such a beginning as i have mentioned or at least have manifest footsteps of it he must show a strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact when it agrees not with his hypothesis who will not allow that the beginning of rome and venice were by the uniting together of several men free and independent one of another amongst whom there was no natural superiority or subjection and if josephus acostas word may be taken he tells us that in many parts of america there was no government at all there are great and apparent conjectures says he that these men speaking of those of peru for a long time had neither kings nor commonwealths but lived in troops as they do this day in florida the cheriquanas those of brazil and many other nations which have no certain kings but as occasion is offered in peace or war they choose their captains as they please lib i cap if it be said that every man there was born subject to his father or the head of his family that the subjection due from a child to a father took away not his freedom of uniting into what political society he thought fit has been already proved but be that as it will these men it is evident were actually free and whatever superiority some politicians now would place in any of them they themselves claimed it not but by consent were all equal till by the same consent they set rulers over themselves so that their politic societies all began from a voluntary union and the mutual agreement of men freely acting in the choice of their governors and forms of govern ment and i hope those who went away from sparta with palantus mentioned by justin will be allowed to have been freemen independent one of another and to have set up a government over themselves by their own consent thus i have given several examples out of history of people free and in the state of nature that being met together incorporated and began a commonwealth and if the want of such instances be an argument to prove that government were not nor could not be so begun i suppose the contenders for paternal empire were better let it alone than urge it against natural liberty for if they can give so many instances out of history of governments begun upon paternal right i think though at least an argument from what has been to what should of right be of no great force one might without any great danger yield them the cause but if i might advise them in the case they would do well not to search too much into the original of governments as they have begun de facto lest they should find at the foundation of most of them something very little favourable to the design they promote and such a power as they contend for but to conclude reason being plain on our side that men are naturally free and the examples of history showing that the governments of the world that were begun in peace had their beginning laid on that foundation and were made by the consent of the people there can be little room for doubt either where the right is or what has been the opinion or practice of mankind about the first erecting of governments i will not deny that if we look back as far as history will direct us towards the original of commonwealths we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man and i am also apt to believe that where a family was numerous enough to subsist by itself and continued entire together without mixing with others as it often happens where there is much land and few people the government commonly began in the father for the father having by the law of nature the same power with every man else to punish as he thought fit any offences against that law might thereby punish his transgressing children even when they were men and out of their pupilage and they were very likely to submit to his punishment and all join with him against the offender in their turns giving him thereby power to execute his sentence against any transgression and so in effect make him the lawmaker and governor over all that remained in conjunction with his family he was fittest to be trusted paternal affection secured their property and interest under his care and the custom of obeying him in their childhood made it easier to submit to him rather than any other if therefore they must have one to rule them as government is hardly to be avoided amongst men that live together who so likely to be the man as he that was their common father unless negligence cruelty or any other defect of mind or body made him unfit for it but when either the father died and left his next heirfor want of age wisdom courage or any other qualitiesless fit for rule or where several families met and consented to continue together there it is not to be doubted but they used their natural freedom to set up him whom they judged the ablest and most likely to rule well over them conformable hereunto we find the people of america wholiving out of the reach of the conquering swords and spreading domination of the two great empires of peru and mexico enjoyed their own natural freedom though caeteris paribus they commonly prefer the heir of their deceased king yet if they find him any way weak or incapable they pass him by and set up the stoutest and bravest man for their ruler thus though looking back as far as records give us any account of peopling the world and the history of nations we commonly find the government to be in one hand yet it destroys not that which i affirmviz that the beginning of politic society depends upon the consent of the individuals to join into and make one society who when they are thus incorporated might set up what form of government they thought fit but this having given occasion to men to mistake and think that by nature government was monarchical and belonged to the father it may not be amiss here to consider why people in the beginning generally pitched upon this form which though perhaps the fathers preeminency might in the first institution of some commonwealths give a rise to and place in the beginning the power in one hand yet it is plain that the reason that continued the form of government in a single person was not any regard or respect to paternal authority since all petty monarchies that is almost all monarchies near their original have been commonly at least upon occasion elective first then in the beginning of things the fathers government of the childhood of those sprung from him having accustomed them to the rule of one man and taught them that where it was exercised with care and skill with affection and love to those under it it was sufficient to procure and preserve men all the political happiness they sought for in society it was no wonder that they should pitch upon and naturally run into that form of government which from their infancy they had been all accustomed to and which by experience they had found both easy and safe to which if we add that monarchy being simple and most obvious to men whom neither experience had instructed in forms of government nor the ambition or insolence of empire had taught to beware of the encroachments of prerogative or the inconveniencies of absolute power which monarchy in succession was apt to lay claim to and bring upon them it was not at all strange that they should not much trouble themselves to think of methods of restraining any exorbitances of those to whom they had given the authority over them and of balancing the power of government by placing several parts of it in different hands they had neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion nor did the fashion of the age nor their possessions or way of living which afforded little matter for covetousness or ambition give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it and therefore it is no wonder they put themselves into such a frame of government as was not only as i said most obvious and simple but also best suited to their present state and condition which stood more in need of defence against foreign invasions and injuries than of multiplicity of laws where there was but very little property and wanted not variety of rulers and abundance of officers to direct and look after their execution where there were but few trespassers and few offenders since then those who liked one another so well as to join into society cannot but be supposed to have some acquaintance and friendship together and some trust one in another they could not but have greater apprehensions of others than of one another and therefore their first care and thought cannot but be supposed to be how to secure themselves against foreign force it was natural for them to put themselves under a frame of government which might best serve to that end and choose the wisest and bravest man to conduct them in their wars and lead them out against their enemies and in this chiefly be their ruler thus we see that the kings of the indians in america which is still a pattern of the first ages in asia and europe whilst the inhabitants were too few for the country and want of people and money gave men no temptation to enlarge their possessions of land or contest for wider extent of ground are little more than generals of their armies and though they command absolutely in war yet at home and in time of peace they exercise very little dominion and have but a very moderate sovereignty the resolutions of peace and war being ordinarily either in the people or in a council though the war itself which admits not of pluralities of governors naturally evolves the command into the kings sole authority and thus in israel itself the chief business of their judges and first kings seems to have been to be captains in war and leaders of their armies which besides what is signified by going out and in before the people which was to march forth to war and home again at the heads of their forces appears plainly in the story of jephtha the ammonites making war upon israel the gileadites in fear send to jephtha a bastard of their family whom they had cast off and article with him if he will assist them against the ammonites to make him their ruler which they do in these words and the people made him head and captain over them judges which was as it seems all one as to be judge and he judged israel judges that is was their captaingeneral six years so when jotham upbraids the shechemites with the obligation they had to gideon who had been their judge and ruler he tells them he fought for you and adventured his life for and delivered you out of the hands of midian judges nothing mentioned of him but what he did as a general and indeed that is all is found in his history or in any of the rest of the judges and abimelech particularly is called king though at most he was but their general and when being weary of the illconduct of samuels sons the children of israel desired a king like all the nations to judge them and to go out before them and to fight their battles sam god granting their desire says to samuel i will send thee a man and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hands of the philistines ch as if the only business of a king had been to lead out their armies and fight in their defence and accordingly at his inauguration pouring a vial of oil upon him declares to saul that the lord had anointed him to be captain over his inheritance ch and therefore those who after saul being solemnly chosen and saluted king by the tribes at mispah were unwilling to have him their king make no other objection but this how shall this man save us ch as if they should have said this man is unfit to be our king not having skill and conduct enough in war to be able to defend us and when god resolved to transfer the government to david it is in these words but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people ch as if the whole kingly authority were nothing else but to be their general and therefore the tribes who had stuck to sauls family and opposed davids reign when they came to hebron with terms of submission to him they tell him amongst other arguments they had to submit to him as to their king that he was in effect their king in sauls time and therefore they had no reason but to receive him as their king now also say they in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel thus whether a family by degrees grew up into a commonwealth and the fatherly authority being continued on to the elder son every one in his turn growing up under it tacitly submitted to it and the easiness and equality of it not offending any one every one acquiesced till time seemed to have confirmed it and settled a right of succession by prescription or whether several families or the descendants of several families whom chance neighbourhood or business brought together united into society the need of a general whose conduct might defend them against their enemies in war and the great confidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but virtuous age such as are almost all those which begin governments that ever come to last in the world gave men one of another made the first beginners of commonwealths generally put the rule into one mans hand without any other express limitation or restraint but what the nature of the thing and the end of government required it was given them for the public good and safety and to those ends in the infancies of commonwealths they commonly used it and unless they had done so young societies could not have subsisted without such nursing fathers without this care of the governors all governments would have sunk under the weakness and infirmities of their infancy the prince and the people had soon perished together but the golden age though before vain ambition and amor sceleratus habendi evil concupiscence had corrupted mens minds into a mistake of true power and honour had more virtue and consequently better governors as well as less vicious subjects and there was then no stretching prerogative on the one side to oppress the people nor consequently on the other any dispute about privilege to lessen or restrain the power of the magistrate and so no contest betwixt rulers and people about governors or government yet when ambition and luxury in future ages would retain and increase the power without doing the business for which it was given and aided by flattery taught princes to have distinct and separate interests from their people men found it necessary to examine more carefully the original and rights of government and to find out ways to restrain the exorbitances and prevent the abuses of that power which they having entrusted in anothers hands only for their own good they found was made use of to hurt them thus we may see how probable it is that people that were naturally free and by their own consent either submitted to the government of their father or united together out of different families to make a government should generally put the rule into one mans hands and choose to be under the conduct of a single person without so much as by express conditions limiting or regulating his power which they thought safe enough in his honesty and prudence though they never dreamed of monarchy being jure divino which we never heard of among mankind till it was revealed to us by the divinity of this last age nor ever allowed paternal power to have a right to dominion or to be the foundation of all government and thus much may suffice to show that as far as we have any light from history we have reason to conclude that all peaceful beginnings of government have been laid in the consent of the people i say peaceful because i shall have occasion in another place to speak of conquest which some esteem a way of beginning of governments the other objection i find urged against the beginning of polities in the way i have mentioned is this viz that all men being born under government some or other it is impossible any of them should ever be free and at liberty to unite together and begin a new one or ever be able to erect a lawful government if this argument be good i ask how came so many lawful monarchies into the world for if anybody upon this supposition can show me any one man in any age of the world free to begin a lawful monarchy i will be bound to show him ten other free men at liberty at the same time to unite and begin a new government under a regal or any other form it being demonstration that if any one born under the dominion of another may be so free as to have a right to command others in a new and distinct empire every one that is born under the dominion of another may be so free too and may become a ruler or subject of a distinct separate government and so by this their own principle either all men however born are free or else there is but one lawful prince one lawful government in the world and then they have nothing to do but barely to show us which that is which when they have done i doubt not but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him though it be a sufficient answer to their objection to show that it involves them in the same difficulties that it doth those they use it against yet i shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this argument a little farther all men say they are born under government and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one every one is born a subject to his father or his prince and is therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it is plain mankind never owned nor considered any such natural subjection that they were born in to one or to the other that tied them without their own consents to a subjection to them and their heirs for there are no examples so frequent in history both sacred and profane as those of men withdrawing themselves and their obedience from the jurisdiction they were born under and the family or community they were bred up in and setting up new governments in other places from whence sprang all that number of petty commonwealths in the beginning of ages and which always multiplied as long as there was room enough till the stronger or more fortunate swallowed the weaker and those great ones again breaking to pieces dissolved into lesser dominions all which are so many testimonies against paternal sovereignty and plainly prove that it was not the natural right of the father descending to his heirs that made governments in the beginning since it was impossible upon that ground there should have been so many little kingdoms but only one universal monarchy if men had not been at liberty to separate themselves from their families and their government be it what it will that was set up in it and go and make distinct commonwealths and other governments as they thought fit this has been the practice of the world from its first beginning to this day nor is it now any more hindrance to the freedom of mankind that they are born under constituted and ancient polities that have established laws and set forms of government than if they were born in the woods amongst the unconfined inhabitants that run loose in them for those who would persuade us that by being born under any government we are naturally subjects to it and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature have no other reason bating that of paternal power which we have already answered to produce for it but only because our fathers or progenitors passed away their natural liberty and thereby bound up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government which they themselves submitted to it is true that whatever engagements or promises any one made for himself he is under the obligation of them but cannot by any compact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man being altogether as free as the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of anybody else he may indeed annex such conditions to the land he enjoyed as a subject of any commonwealth as may oblige his son to be of that community if he will enjoy those possessions which were his fathers because that estate being his fathers property he may dispose or settle it as he pleases and this has generally given the occasion to the mistake in this matter because commonwealths not permitting any part of their dominions to be dismembered nor to be enjoyed by any but those of their community the son cannot ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his father but under the same terms his father did by becoming a member of the society whereby he puts himself presently under the government he finds there established as much as any other subject of that commonweal and thus the consent of free men born under government which only makes them members of it being given separately in their turns as each comes to be of age and not in a multitude together people take no notice of it and thinking it not done at all or not necessary conclude they are naturally subjects as they are men but it is plain governments themselves understand it otherwise they claim no power over the son because of that they had over the father nor look on children as being their subjects by their fathers being so if a subject of england have a child by an englishwoman in france whose subject is he not the king of englands for he must have leave to be admitted to the privileges of it nor the king of frances for how then has his father a liberty to bring him away and breed him as he pleases and whoever was judged as a traitor or deserter if he left or warred against a country for being barely born in it of parents that were aliens there it is plain then by the practice of governments themselves as well as by the law of right reason that a child is born a subject of no country nor government he is under his fathers tuition and authority till he come to age of discretion and then he is a free man at liberty what government he will put himself under what body politic he will unite himself to for if an englishmans son born in france be at liberty and may do so it is evident there is no tie upon him by his father being a subject of that kingdom nor is he bound up by any compact of his ancestors and why then hath not his son by the same reason the same liberty though he be born anywhere else since the power that a father hath naturally over his children is the same wherever they be born and the ties of natural obligations are not bounded by the positive limits of kingdoms and commonwealths every man being as has been showed naturally free and nothing being able to put him into subjection to any earthly power but only his own consent it is to be considered what shall be understood to be a sufficient declaration of a mans consent to make him subject to the laws of any government there is a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent which will concern our present case nobody doubts but an express consent of any man entering into any society makes him a perfect member of that society a subject of that government the difficulty is what ought to be looked upon as a tacit consent and how far it bindsie how far any one shall be looked on to have consented and thereby submitted to any government where he has made no expressions of it at all and to this i say that every man that hath any possession or enjoyment of any part of the dominions of any government doth hereby give his tacit consent and is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government during such enjoyment as any one under it whether this his possession be of land to him and his heirs for ever or a lodging only for a week or whether it be barely travelling freely on the highway and in effect it reaches as far as the very being of any one within the territories of that government to understand this the better it is fit to consider that every man when he at first incorporates himself into any commonwealth he by his uniting himself thereunto annexes also and submits to the community those possessions which he has or shall acquire that do not already belong to any other government for it would be a direct contradiction for any one to enter into society with others for the securing and regulating of property and yet to suppose his land whose property is to be regulated by the laws of the society should be exempt from the jurisdiction of that government to which he himself and the property of the land is a subject by the same act therefore whereby any one unites his person which was before free to any commonwealth by the same he unites his possessions which were before free to it also and they become both of them person and possession subject to the government and dominion of that commonwealth as long as it hath a being whoever therefore from thenceforth by inheritance purchases permission or otherwise enjoys any part of the land so annexed to and under the government of that commonweal must take it with the condition it is underthat is of submitting to the government of the commonwealth under whose jurisdiction it is as far forth as any subject of it but since the government has a direct jurisdiction only over the land and reaches the possessor of it before he has actually incorporated himself in the society only as he dwells upon and enjoys that the obligation any one is under by virtue of such enjoyment to submit to the government begins and ends with the enjoyment so that whenever the owner who has given nothing but such a tacit consent to the government will by donation sale or otherwise quit the said possession he is at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other commonwealth or agree with others to begin a new one in vacuis locis in any part of the world they can find free and unpossessed whereas he that has once by actual agreement and any express declaration given his consent to be of any commonweal is perpetually and indispensably obliged to be and remain unalterably a subject to it and can never be again in the liberty of the state of nature unless by any calamity the government he was under comes to be dissolved but submitting to the laws of any country living quietly and enjoying privileges and protection under them makes not a man a member of that society it is only a local protection and homage due to and from all those who not being in a state of war come within the territories belonging to any government to all parts whereof the force of its law extends but this no more makes a man a member of that society a perpetual subject of that commonwealth than it would make a man a subject to another in whose family he found it convenient to abide for some time though whilst he continued in it he were obliged to comply with the laws and submit to the government he found there and thus we see that foreigners by living all their lives under another government and enjoying the privileges and protection of it though they are bound even in conscience to submit to its administration as far forth as any denizen yet do not thereby come to be subjects or members of that commonwealth nothing can make any man so but his actually entering into it by positive engagement and express promise and compact this is that which i think concerning the beginning of political societies and that consent which makes any one a member of any commonwealth of the ends of political society and government if man in the state of nature be so free as has been said if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions equal to the greatest and subject to nobody why will he part with his freedom this empire and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power to which it is obvious to answer that though in the state of nature he hath such a right yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain and constantly exposed to the invasion of others for all being kings as much as he every man his equal and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe very insecure this makes him willing to quit this condition which however free is full of fears and continual dangers and it is not without reason that he seeks out and is willing to join in society with others who are already united or have a mind to unite for the mutual preservation of their lives liberties and estates which i call by the general nameproperty the great and chief end therefore of men uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves under government is the preservation of their property to which in the state of nature there are many things wanting firstly there wants an established settled known law received and allowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong and the common measure to decide all controversies between them for though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures yet men being biased by their interest as well as ignorant for want of study of it are not apt to allow of it as a law binding to them in the application of it to their particular cases secondly in the state of nature there wants a known and indifferent judge with authority to determine all differences according to the established law for every one in that state being both judge and executioner of the law of nature men being partial to themselves passion and revenge is very apt to carry them too far and with too much heat in their own cases as well as negligence and unconcernedness make them too remiss in other mens thirdly in the state of nature there often wants power to back and support the sentence when right and to give it due execution they who by any injustice offended will seldom fail where they are able by force to make good their injustice such resistance many times makes the punishment dangerous and frequently destructive to those who attempt it thus mankind notwithstanding all the privileges of the state of nature being but in an ill condition while they remain in it are quickly driven into society hence it comes to pass that we seldom find any number of men live any time together in this state the inconveniencies that they are therein exposed to by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the power every man has of punishing the transgressions of others make them take sanctuary under the established laws of government and therein seek the preservation of their property it is this that makes them so willingly give up every one his single power of punishing to be exercised by such alone as shall be appointed to it amongst them and by such rules as the community or those authorised by them to that purpose shall agree on and in this we have the original right and rise of both the legislative and executive power as well as of the governments and societies themselves for in the state of nature to omit the liberty he has of innocent delights a man has two powers the first is to do whatsoever he thinks fit for the preservation of himself and others within the permission of the law of nature by which law common to them all he and all the rest of mankind are one community make up one society distinct from all other creatures and were it not for the corruption and viciousness of degenerate men there would be no need of any other no necessity that men should separate from this great and natural community and associate into lesser combinations the other power a man has in the state of nature is the power to punish the crimes committed against that law both these he gives up when he joins in a private if i may so call it or particular political society and incorporates into any commonwealth separate from the rest of mankind the first powerviz of doing whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind he gives up to be regulated by laws made by the society so far forth as the preservation of himself and the rest of that society shall require which laws of the society in many things confine the liberty he had by the law of nature secondly the power of punishing he wholly gives up and engages his natural force which he might before employ in the execution of the law of nature by his own single authority as he thought fit to assist the executive power of the society as the law thereof shall require for being now in a new state wherein he is to enjoy many conveniencies from the labour assistance and society of others in the same community as well as protection from its whole strength he is to part also with as much of his natural liberty in providing for himself as the good prosperity and safety of the society shall require which is not only necessary but just since the other members of the society do the like but though men when they enter into society give up the equality liberty and executive power they had in the state of nature into the hands of the society to be so far disposed of by the legislative as the good of the society shall require yet it being only with an intention in every one the better to preserve himself his liberty and property for no rational creature can be supposed to change his condition with an intention to be worse the power of the society or legislative constituted by them can never be supposed to extend farther than the common good but is obliged to secure every ones property by providing against those three defects above mentioned that made the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy and so whoever has the legislative or supreme power of any commonwealth is bound to govern by established standing laws promulgated and known to the people and not by extemporary decrees by indifferent and upright judges who are to decide controversies by those laws and to employ the force of the community at home only in the execution of such laws or abroad to prevent or redress foreign injuries and secure the community from inroads and invasion and all this to be directed to no other end but the peace safety and public good of the people of the forms of a commonwealth the majority having as has been showed upon mens first uniting into society the whole power of the community naturally in them may employ all that power in making laws for the community from time to time and executing those laws by officers of their own appointing and then the form of the government is a perfect democracy or else may put the power of making laws into the hands of a few select men and their heirs or successors and then it is an oligarchy or else into the hands of one man and then it is a monarchy if to him and his heirs it is a hereditary monarchy if to him only for life but upon his death the power only of nominating a successor to return to them an elective monarchy and so accordingly of these make compounded and mixed forms of government as they think good and if the legislative power be at first given by the majority to one or more persons only for their lives or any limited time and then the supreme power to revert to them again when it is so reverted the community may dispose of it again anew into what hands they please and so constitute a new form of government for the form of government depending upon the placing the supreme power which is the legislative it being impossible to conceive that an inferior power should prescribe to a superior or any but the supreme make laws according as the power of making laws is placed such is the form of the commonwealth by commonwealth i must be understood all along to mean not a democracy or any form of government but any independent community which the latins signified by the word civitas to which the word which best answers in our language is commonwealth and most properly expresses such a society of men which community does not for there may be subordinate communities in a government and city much less and therefore to avoid ambiguity i crave leave to use the word commonwealth in that sense in which sense i find the word used by king james himself which i think to be its genuine signification which if anybody dislike i consent with him to change it for a better of the extent of the legislative power the great end of mens entering into society being the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety and the great instrument and means of that being the laws established in that society the first and fundamental positive law of all commonwealths is the establishing of the legislative power as the first and fundamental natural law which is to govern even the legislative itself is the preservation of the society and as far as will consist with the public good of every person in it this legislative is not only the supreme power of the commonwealth but sacred and unalterable in the hands where the community have once placed it nor can any edict of anybody else in what form soever conceived or by what power soever backed have the force and obligation of a law which has not its sanction from that legislative which the public has chosen and appointed for without this the law could not have that which is absolutely necessary to its being a law the consent of the society over whom nobody can have a power to make laws but by their own consent and by authority received from them and therefore all the obedience which by the most solemn ties any one can be obliged to pay ultimately terminates in this supreme power and is directed by those laws which it enacts nor can any oaths to any foreign power whatsoever or any domestic subordinate power discharge any member of the society from his obedience to the legislative acting pursuant to their trust nor oblige him to any obedience contrary to the laws so enacted or farther than they do allow it being ridiculous to imagine one can be tied ultimately to obey any power in the society which is not the supreme though the legislative whether placed in one or more whether it be always in being or only by intervals though it be the supreme power in every commonwealth yet first it is not nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the lives and fortunes of the people for it being but the joint power of every member of the society given up to that person or assembly which is legislator it can be no more than those persons had in a state of nature before they entered into society and gave it up to the community for nobody can transfer to another more power than he has in himself and nobody has an absolute arbitrary power over himself or over any other to destroy his own life or take away the life or property of another a man as has been proved cannot subject himself to the arbitrary power of another and having in the state of nature no arbitrary power over the life liberty or possession of another but only so much as the law of nature gave him for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind this is all he doth or can give up to the commonwealth and by it to the legislative power so that the legislative can have no more than this their power in the utmost bounds of it is limited to the public good of the society it is a power that hath no other end but preservation and therefore can never have a right to destroy enslave or designedly to impoverish the subjects the obligations of the law of nature cease not in society but only in many cases are drawn closer and have by human laws known penalties annexed to them to enforce their observation thus the law of nature stands as an eternal rule to all men legislators as well as others the rules that they make for other mens actions must as well as their own and other mens actions be conformable to the law of nature ie to the will of god of which that is a declaration and the fundamental law of nature being the preservation of mankind no human sanction can be good or valid against it secondly the legislative or supreme authority cannot assume to itself a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decrees but is bound to dispense justice and decide the rights of the subject by promulgated standing laws and known authorised judges for the law of nature being unwritten and so nowhere to be found but in the minds of men they who through passion or interest shall miscite or misapply it cannot so easily be convinced of their mistake where there is no established judge and so it serves not as it aught to determine the rights and fence the properties of those that live under it especially where every one is judge interpreter and executioner of it too and that in his own case and he that has right on his side having ordinarily but his own single strength hath not force enough to defend himself from injuries or punish delinquents to avoid these inconveniencies which disorder mens properties in the state of nature men unite into societies that they may have the united strength of the whole society to secure and defend their properties and may have standing rules to bound it by which every one may know what is his to this end it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into and the community put the legislative power into such hands as they think fit with this trust that they shall be governed by declared laws or else their peace quiet and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the state of nature absolute arbitrary power or governing without settled standing laws can neither of them consist with the ends of society and government which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for and tie themselves up under were it not to preserve their lives liberties and fortunes and by stated rules of right and property to secure their peace and quiet it cannot be supposed that they should intend had they a power so to do to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates and put a force into the magistrates hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it whether invaded by a single man or many in combination whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator they have disarmed themselves and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases he being in a much worse condition that is exposed to the arbitrary power of one man who has the command of a hundred thousand than he that is exposed to the arbitrary power of a hundred thousand single men nobody being secure that his will who has such a command is better than that of other men though his force be a hundred thousand times stronger and therefore whatever form the commonwealth is under the ruling power ought to govern by declared and received laws and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions for then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature if they shall have armed one or a few men with the joint power of a multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts or unrestrained and till that moment unknown wills without having any measures set down which may guide and justify their actions for all the power the government has being only for the good of the society as it ought not to be arbitrary and at pleasure so it ought to be exercised by established and promulgated laws that both the people may know their duty and be safe and secure within the limits of the law and the rulers too kept within their due bounds and not be tempted by the power they have in their hands to employ it to purposes and by such measures as they would not have known and own not willingly thirdly the supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property without his own consent for the preservation of property being the end of government and that for which men enter into society it necessarily supposes and requires that the people should have property without which they must be supposed to lose that by entering into society which was the end for which they entered into it too gross an absurdity for any man to own men therefore in society having property they have such a right to the goods which by the law of the community are theirs that nobody hath a right to take them or any part of them from them without their own consent without this they have no property at all for i have truly no property in that which another can by right take from me when he pleases against my consent hence it is a mistake to think that the supreme or legislative power of any commonwealth can do what it will and dispose of the estates of the subject arbitrarily or take any part of them at pleasure this is not much to be feared in governments where the legislative consists wholly or in part in assemblies which are variable whose members upon the dissolution of the assembly are subjects under the common laws of their country equally with the rest but in governments where the legislative is in one lasting assembly always in being or in one man as in absolute monarchies there is danger still that they will think themselves to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community and so will be apt to increase their own riches and power by taking what they think fit from the people for a mans property is not at all secure though there be good and equitable laws to set the bounds of it between him and his fellowsubjects if he who commands those subjects have power to take from any private man what part he pleases of his property and use and dispose of it as he thinks good but government into whosesoever hands it is put being as i have before shown entrusted with this condition and for this end that men might have and secure their properties the prince or senate however it may have power to make laws for the regulating of property between the subjects one amongst another yet can never have a power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the subjects property without their own consent for this would be in effect to leave them no property at all and to let us see that even absolute power where it is necessary is not arbitrary by being absolute but is still limited by that reason and confined to those ends which required it in some cases to be absolute we need look no farther than the common practice of martial discipline for the preservation of the army and in it of the whole commonwealth requires an absolute obedience to the command of every superior officer and it is justly death to disobey or dispute the most dangerous or unreasonable of them but yet we see that neither the sergeant that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a cannon or stand in a breach where he is almost sure to perish can command that soldier to give him one penny of his money nor the general that can condemn him to death for deserting his post or not obeying the most desperate orders cannot yet with all his absolute power of life and death dispose of one farthing of that soldiers estate or seize one jot of his goods whom yet he can command anything and hang for the least disobedience because such a blind obedience is necessary to that end for which the commander has his powerviz the preservation of the rest but the disposing of his goods has nothing to do with it it is true governments cannot be supported without great charge and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it but still it must be with his own consentie the consent of the majority giving it either by themselves or their representatives chosen by them for if any one shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people by his own authority and without such consent of the people he thereby invades the fundamental law of property and subverts the end of government for what property have i in that which another may by right take when he pleases to himself fourthly the legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands for it being but a delegated power from the people they who have it cannot pass it over to others the people alone can appoint the form of the commonwealth which is by constituting the legislative and appointing in whose hands that shall be and when the people have said we will submit and be governed by laws made by such men and in such forms nobody else can say other men shall make laws for them nor can they be bound by any laws but such as are enacted by those whom they have chosen and authorised to make laws for them these are the bounds which the trust that is put in them by the society and the law of god and nature have set to the legislative power of every commonwealth in all forms of government first they are to govern by promulgated established laws not to be varied in particular cases but to have one rule for rich and poor for the favourite at court and the countryman at plough secondly these laws also ought to be designed for no other end ultimately but the good of the people thirdly they must not raise taxes on the property of the people without the consent of the people given by themselves or their deputies and this properly concerns only such governments where the legislative is always in being or at least where the people have not reserved any part of the legislative to deputies to be from time to time chosen by themselves fourthly legislative neither must nor can transfer the power of making laws to anybody else or place it anywhere but where the people have the legislative executive and federative power of the commonwealth the legislative power is that which has a right to direct how the force of the commonwealth shall be employed for preserving the community and the members of it because those laws which are constantly to be executed and whose force is always to continue may be made in a little time therefore there is no need that the legislative should be always in being not having always business to do and because it may be too great temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power for the same persons who have the power of making laws to have also in their hands the power to execute them whereby they may exempt themselves from obedience to the laws they make and suit the law both in its making and execution to their own private advantage and thereby come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community contrary to the end of society and government therefore in wellordered commonwealths where the good of the whole is so considered as it ought the legislative power is put into the hands of divers persons who duly assembled have by themselves or jointly with others a power to make laws which when they have done being separated again they are themselves subject to the laws they have made which is a new and near tie upon them to take care that they make them for the public good but because the laws that are at once and in a short time made have a constant and lasting force and need a perpetual execution or an attendance thereunto therefore it is necessary there should be a power always in being which should see to the execution of the laws that are made and remain in force and thus the legislative and executive power come often to be separated there is another power in every commonwealth which one may call natural because it is that which answers to the power every man naturally had before he entered into society for though in a commonwealth the members of it are distinct persons still in reference to one another and as such are governed by the laws of the society yet in reference to the rest of mankind they make one body which is as every member of it before was still in the state of nature with the rest of mankind so that the controversies that happen between any man of the society with those that are out of it are managed by the public and an injury done to a member of their body engages the whole in the reparation of it so that under this consideration the whole community is one body in the state of nature in respect of all other states or persons out of its community this therefore contains the power of war and peace leagues and alliances and all the transactions with all persons and communities without the commonwealth and may be called federative if any one pleases so the thing be understood i am indifferent as to the name these two powers executive and federative though they be really distinct in themselves yet one comprehending the execution of the municipal laws of the society within itself upon all that are parts of it the other the management of the security and interest of the public without with all those that it may receive benefit or damage from yet they are always almost united and though this federative power in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the commonwealth yet it is much less capable to be directed by antecedent standing positive laws than the executive and so must necessarily be left to the prudence and wisdom of those whose hands it is in to be managed for the public good for the laws that concern subjects one amongst another being to direct their actions may well enough precede them but what is to be done in reference to foreigners depending much upon their actions and the variation of designs and interests must be left in great part to the prudence of those who have this power committed to them to be managed by the best of their skill for the advantage of the commonwealth though as i said the executive and federative power of every community be really distinct in themselves yet they are hardly to be separated and placed at the same time in the hands of distinct persons for both of them requiring the force of the society for their exercise it is almost impracticable to place the force of the commonwealth in distinct and not subordinate hands or that the executive and federative power should be placed in persons that might act separately whereby the force of the public would be under different commands which would be apt some time or other to cause disorder and ruin of the subordination of the powers of the commonwealth though in a constituted commonwealth standing upon its own basis and acting according to its own naturethat is acting for the preservation of the community there can be but one supreme power which is the legislative to which all the rest are and must be subordinate yet the legislative being only a fiduciary power to act for certain ends there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them for all power given with trust for the attaining an end being limited by that end whenever that end is manifestly neglected or opposed the trust must necessarily be forfeited and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security and thus the community perpetually retains a supreme power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of anybody even of their legislators whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked as to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the subject for no man or society of men having a power to deliver up their preservation or consequently the means of it to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion of another whenever any one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition they will always have a right to preserve what they have not a power to part with and to rid themselves of those who invade this fundamental sacred and unalterable law of selfpreservation for which they entered into society and thus the community may be said in this respect to be always the supreme power but not as considered under any form of government because this power of the people can never take place till the government be dissolved in all cases whilst the government subsists the legislative is the supreme power for what can give laws to another must needs be superior to him and since the legislative is no otherwise legislative of the society but by the right it has to make laws for all the parts and every member of the society prescribing rules to their actions they are transgressed the legislative must needs be the supreme and all other powers in any members or parts of the society derived from and subordinate to it in some commonwealths where the legislative is not always in being and the executive is vested in a single person who has also a share in the legislative there that single person in a very tolerable sense may also be called supreme not that he has in himself all the supreme power which is that of lawmaking but because he has in him the supreme execution from whom all inferior magistrates derive all their several subordinate powers or at least the greatest part of them having also no legislative superior to him there being no law to be made without his consent which cannot be expected should ever subject him to the other part of the legislative he is properly enough in this sense supreme but yet it is to be observed that though oaths of allegiance and fealty are taken to him it is not to him as supreme legislator but as supreme executor of the law made by a joint power of him with others allegiance being nothing but an obedience according to law which when he violates he has no right to obedience nor can claim it otherwise than as the public person vested with the power of the law and so is to be considered as the image phantom or representative of the commonwealth acted by the will of the society declared in its laws and thus he has no will no power but that of the law but when he quits this representa tion this public will and acts by his own private will he degrades himself and is but a single private person without power and without will the members owing no obedience but to the public will of the society the executive power placed anywhere but in a person that has also a share in the legislative is visibly subordinate and accountable to it and may be at pleasure changed and displaced so that it is not the supreme executive power that is exempt from subordination but the supreme executive power vested in one who having a share in the legislative has no distinct superior legislative to be subordinate and accountable to farther than he himself shall join and consent so that he is no more subordinate than he himself shall think fit which one may certainly conclude will be but very little of other ministerial and subordinate powers in a commonwealth we need not speak they being so multiplied with infinite variety in the different customs and constitutions of distinct commonwealths that it is impossible to give a particular account of them all only thus much which is necessary to our present purpose we may take notice of concerning them that they have no manner of authority any of them beyond what is by positive grant and commission delegated to them and are all of them accountable to some other power in the commonwealth it is not necessaryno nor so much as convenientthat the legislative should be always in being but absolutely necessary that the executive power should because there is not always need of new laws to be made but always need of execution of the laws that are made when the legislative hath put the execution of the laws they make into other hands they have a power still to resume it out of those hands when they find cause and to punish for any maladministration against the laws the same holds also in regard of the federative power that and the executive being both ministerial and subordinate to the legislative which as has been shown in a constituted commonwealth is the supreme the legislative also in this case being supposed to consist of several persons for if it be a single person it cannot but be always in being and so will as supreme naturally have the supreme executive power together with the legislative may assemble and exercise their legislative at the times that either their original constitution or their own adjournment appoints or when they please if neither of these hath appointed any time or there be no other way prescribed to convoke them for the supreme power being placed in them by the people it is always in them and they may exercise it when they please unless by their original constitution they are limited to certain seasons or by an act of their supreme power they have adjourned to a certain time and when that time comes they have a right to assemble and act again if the legislative or any part of it be of representatives chosen for that time by the people which afterwards return into the ordinary state of subjects and have no share in the legislative but upon a new choice this power of choosing must also be exercised by the people either at certain appointed seasons or else when they are summoned to it and in this latter case the power of convoking the legislative is ordinarily placed in the executive and has one of these two limitations in respect of timethat either the original constitution requires their assembling and acting at certain intervals and then the executive power does nothing but ministerially issue directions for their electing and assembling according to due forms or else it is left to his prudence to call them by new elections when the occasions or exigencies of the public require the amendment of old or making of new laws or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies that lie on or threaten the people it may be demanded here what if the executive power being possessed of the force of the commonwealth shall make use of that force to hinder the meeting and acting of the legislative when the original constitution or the public exigencies require it i say using force upon the people without authority and contrary to the trust put in him that does so is a state of war with the people who have a right to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power for having erected a legislative with an intent they should exercise the power of making laws either at certain set times or when there is need of it when they are hindered by any force from what is so necessary to the society and wherein the safety and preservation of the people consists the people have a right to remove it by force in all states and conditions the true remedy of force without authority is to oppose force to it the use of force without authority always puts him that uses it into a state of war as the aggressor and renders him liable to be treated accordingly the power of assembling and dismissing the legislative placed in the executive gives not the executive a superiority over it but is a fiduciary trust placed in him for the safety of the people in a case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affairs could not bear a steady fixed rule for it not being possible that the first framers of the government should by any foresight be so much masters of future events as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and duration to the assemblies of the legislative in all times to come that might exactly answer all the exigencies of the commonwealth the best remedy could be found for this defect was to trust this to the prudence of one who was always to be present and whose business it was to watch over the public good constant frequent meetings of the legislative and long continuations of their assemblies without necessary occasion could not but be burdensome to the people and must necessarily in time produce more dangerous inconveniencies and yet the quick turn of affairs might be sometimes such as to need their present help any delay of their convening might endanger the public and sometimes too their business might be so great that the limited time of their sitting might be too short for their work and rob the public of that benefit which could be had only from their mature deliberation what then could be done in this case to prevent the community from being exposed some time or other to imminent hazard on one side or the other by fixed intervals and periods set to the meeting and acting of the legislative but to entrust it to the prudence of some who being present and acquainted with the state of public affairs might make use of this prerogative for the public good and where else could this be so well placed as in his hands who was entrusted with the execution of the laws for the same end thus supposing the regulation of times for the assembling and sitting of the legislative not settled by the original constitution it naturally fell into the hands of the executive not as an arbitrary power depending on his good pleasure but with this trust always to have it exercised only for the public weal as the occurrences of times and change of affairs might require whether settled periods of their convening or a liberty left to the prince for convoking the legislative or perhaps a mixture of both hath the least inconvenience attending it it is not my business here to inquire but only to show that though the executive power may have the prerogative of convoking and dissolving such conventions of the legislative yet it is not thereby superior to it things of this world are in so constant a flux that nothing remains long in the same state thus people riches trade power change their stations flourishing mighty cities come to ruin and prove in time neglected desolate corners whilst other unfrequented places grow into populous countries filled with wealth and inhabitants but things not always changing equally and private interest often keeping up customs and privileges when the reasons of them are ceased it often comes to pass that in governments where part of the legislative consists of repre sentatives chosen by the people that in tract of time this representation becomes very unequal and disproportionate to the reasons it was at first established upon to what gross absurdities the following of custom when reason has left it may lead we may be satisfied when we see the bare name of a town of which there remains not so much as the ruins where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote or more inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found send as many representatives to the grand assembly of lawmakers as a whole county numerous in people and powerful in riches this strangers stand amazed at and every one must confess needs a remedy though most think it hard to find one because the constitution of the legislative being the original and supreme act of the society antecedent to all positive laws in it and depending wholly on the people no inferior power can alter it and therefore the people when the legislative is once constituted having in such a government as we have been speaking of no power to act as long as the government stands this inconvenience is thought incapable of a remedy salus populi suprema lex is certainly so just and fundamental a rule that he who sincerely follows it cannot dangerously err if therefore the executive who has the power of convoking the legislative observing rather the true proportion than fashion of representation regulates not by old custom but true reason the number of members in all places that have a right to be distinctly represented which no part of the people however incorporated can pretend to but in proportion to the assistance which it affords to the public it cannot be judged to have set up a new legislative but to have restored the old and true one and to have rectified the disorders which succession of time had insensibly as well as inevitably introduced for it being the interest as well as intention of the people to have a fair and equal representative whoever brings it nearest to that is an undoubted friend to and establisher of the government and cannot miss the consent and approbation of the community prerogative being nothing but a power in the hands of the prince to provide for the public good in such cases which depending upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences certain and unalterable laws could not safely direct whatsoever shall be done manifestly for the good of the people and establishing the government upon its true foundations is and always will be just prerogative the power of erecting new corporations and therewith new representatives carries with it a supposition that in time the measures of representation might vary and those have a just right to be represented which before had none and by the same reason those cease to have a right and be too inconsiderable for such a privilege which before had it it is not a change from the present state which perhaps corruption or decay has introduced that makes an inroad upon the government but the tendency of it to injure or oppress the people and to set up one part or party with a distinction from and an unequal subjection of the rest whatsoever cannot but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the society and people in general upon just and lasting measures will always when done justify itself and whenever the people shall choose their representatives upon just and undeniably equal measures suitable to the original frame of the government it cannot be doubted to be the will and act of the society whoever permitted or proposed to them so to do of prerogative where the legislative and executive power are in distinct hands as they are in all moderated monarchies and wellframed governments there the good of the society requires that several things should be left to the discretion of him that has the executive power for the legislators not being able to foresee and provide by laws for all that may be useful to the community the executor of the laws having the power in his hands has by the common law of nature a right to make use of it for the good of the society in many cases where the municipal law has given no direction till the legislative can conveniently be assembled to provide for it nay many things there are which the law can by no means provide for and those must necessarily be left to the discretion of him that has the executive power in his hands to be ordered by him as the public good and advantage shall require nay it is fit that the laws themselves should in some cases give way to the executive power or rather to this fundamental law of nature and governmentviz that as much as may be all the members of the society are to be preserved for since many accidents may happen wherein a strict and rigid observation of the laws may do harm as not to pull down an innocent mans house to stop the fire when the next to it is burning and a man may come sometimes within the reach of the law which makes no distinction of persons by an action that may deserve reward and pardon it is fit the ruler should have a power in many cases to mitigate the severity of the law and pardon some offenders since the end of government being the preservation of all as much as may be even the guilty are to be spared where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent this power to act according to discretion for the public good without the prescription of the law and sometimes even against it is that which is called prerogative for since in some governments the lawmaking power is not always in being and is usually too numerous and so too slow for the dispatch requisite to execution and because also it is impossible to foresee and so by laws to provide for all accidents and necessities that may concern the public or make such laws as will do no harm if they are executed with an inflexible rigour on all occasions and upon all persons that may come in their way therefore there is a latitude left to the executive power to do many things of choice which the laws do not prescribe this power whilst employed for the benefit of the community and suitably to the trust and ends of the government is undoubted prerogative and never is questioned for the people are very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the point or questioning of prerogative whilst it is in any tolerable degree employed for the use it was meantthat is the good of the people and not manifestly against it but if there comes to be a question between the executive power and the people about a thing claimed as a prerogative the tendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the people will easily decide that question it is easy to conceive that in the infancy of governments when commonwealths differed little from families in number of people they differed from them too but little in number of laws and the governors being as the fathers of them watching over them for their good the government was almost all prerogative a few established laws served the turn and the discretion and care of the ruler suppled the rest but when mistake or flattery prevailed with weak princes to make use of this power for private ends of their own and not for the public good the people were fain by express laws to get prerogative determined in those points wherein they found disadvantage from it and declared limitations of prerogative in those cases which they and their ancestors had left in the utmost latitude to the wisdom of those princes who made no other but a right use of itthat is for the good of their people and therefore they have a very wrong notion of government who say that the people have encroached upon the prerogative when they have got any part of it to be defined by positive laws for in so doing they have not pulled from the prince anything that of right be longed to him but only declared that that power which they indefinitely left in his or his ancestors hands to be exercised for their good was not a thing they intended him when he used it otherwise for the end of government being the good of the community whatsoever alterations are made in it tending to that end cannot be an encroachment upon anybody since nobody in government can have a right tending to any other end and those only are encroachments which prejudice or hinder the public good those who say otherwise speak as if the prince had a distinct and separate interest from the good of the community and was not made for it the root and source from which spring almost all those evils and disorders which happen in kingly governments and indeed if that be so the people under his government are not a society of rational creatures entered into a community for their mutual good such as have set rulers over themselves to guard and promote that good but are to be looked on as a herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a master who keeps them and works them for his own pleasure or profit if men were so void of reason and brutish as to enter into society upon such terms prerogative might indeed be what some men would have it an arbitrary power to do things hurtful to the people but since a rational creature cannot be supposed when free to put himself into subjection to another for his own harm though where he finds a good and a wise ruler he may not perhaps think it either necessary or useful to set precise bounds to his power in all things prerogative can be nothing but the peoples permitting their rulers to do several things of their own free choice where the law was silent and sometimes too against the direct letter of the law for the public good and their acquiescing in it when so done for as a good prince who is mindful of the trust put into his hands and careful of the good of his people cannot have too much prerogative that is power to do good so a weak and ill prince who would claim that power his predecessors exercised without the direction of the law as a prerogative belonging to him by right of his office which he may exercise at his pleasure to make or promote an interest distinct from that of the public gives the people an occasion to claim their right and limit that power which whilst it was exercised for their good they were content should be tacitly allowed and therefore he that will look into the history of england will find that prerogative was always largest in the hands of our wisest and best princes because the people observing the whole tendency of their actions to be the public good or if any human frailty or mistake for princes are but men made as others appeared in some small declinations from that end yet it was visible the main of their conduct tended to nothing but the care of the public the people therefore finding reason to be satisfied with these princes whenever they acted without or contrary to the letter of the law acquiesced in what they did and without the least complaint let them enlarge their prerogative as they pleased judging rightly that they did nothing herein to the prejudice of their laws since they acted conformably to the foundation and end of all lawsthe public good such godlike princes indeed had some title to arbitrary power by that argument that would prove absolute monarchy the best government as that which god himself governs the universe by because such kings partake of his wisdom and goodness upon this is founded that saying that the reigns of good princes have been always most dangerous to the liberties of their people for when their successors managing the government with different thoughts would draw the actions of those good rulers into precedent and make them the standard of their prerogativeas if what had been done only for the good of the people was a right in them to do for the harm of the people if they so pleased it has often occasioned contest and sometimes public disorders before the people could recover their original right and get that to be declared not to be prerogative which truly was never so since it is impossible anybody in the society should ever have a right to do the people harm though it be very possible and reasonable that the people should not go about to set any bounds to the prerogative of those kings or rulers who themselves transgressed not the bounds of the public good for prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule the power of calling parliaments in england as to precise time place and duration is certainly a prerogative of the king but still with this trust that it shall be made use of for the good of the nation as the exigencies of the times and variety of occasion shall require for it being impossible to foresee which should always be the fittest place for them to assemble in and what the best season the choice of these was left with the executive power as might be best subservient to the public good and best suit the ends of parliament the old question will be asked in this matter of prerogative but who shall be judge when this power is made a right use of i answer between an executive power in being with such a prerogative and a legislative that depends upon his will for their convening there can be no judge on earth as there can be none between the legislative and the people should either the executive or the legislative when they have got the power in their hands design or go about to enslave or destroy them the people have no other remedy in this as in all other cases where they have no judge on earth but to appeal to heaven for the rulers in such attempts exercising a power the people never put into their hands who can never be supposed to consent that anybody should rule over them for their harm do that which they have not a right to do and where the body of the people or any single man are deprived of their right or are under the exercise of a power without right having no appeal on earth they have a liberty to appeal to heaven whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment and therefore though the people cannot be judge so as to have by the constitution of that society any superior power to determine and give effective sentence in the case yet they have reserved that ultimate determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind where there lies no appeal on earth by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven and this judgement they cannot part with it being out of a mans power so to submit himself to another as to give him a liberty to destroy him god and nature never allowing a man so to abandon himself as to neglect his own preservation and since he cannot take away his own life neither can he give another power to take it nor let any one think this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder for this operates not till the inconvenience is so great that the majority feel it and are weary of it and find a necessity to have it amended and this the executive power or wise princes never need come in the danger of and it is the thing of all others they have most need to avoid as of all others the most perilous of paternal political and despotical power considered together though i have had occasion to speak of these separately before yet the great mistakes of late about government having as i suppose arisen from confounding these distinct powers one with another it may not perhaps be amiss to consider them here together first then paternal or parental power is nothing but that which parents have over their children to govern them for the childrens good till they come to the use of reason or a state of knowledge wherein they may be supposed capable to understand that rule whether it be the law of nature or the municipal law of their country they are to govern themselves bycapable i say to know it as well as several others who live as free men under that law the affection and tenderness god hath planted in the breasts of parents towards their children makes it evident that this is not intended to be a severe arbitrary government but only for the help instruction and preservation of their offspring but happen as it will there is as i have proved no reason why it should be thought to extend to life and death at any time over their children more than over anybody else or keep the child in subjection to the will of his parents when grown to a man and the perfect use of reason any farther than as having received life and education from his parents obliges him to respect honour gratitude assistance and support all his life to both father and mother and thus it is true the paternal is a natural government but not at all extending itself to the ends and jurisdictions of that which is political the power of the father doth not reach at all to the property of the child which is only in his own disposing secondly political power is that power which every man having in the state of nature has given up into the hands of the society and therein to the governors whom the society hath set over itself with this express or tacit trust that it shall be employed for their good and the preservation of their property now this power which every man has in the state of nature and which he parts with to the society in all such cases where the society can secure him is to use such means for the preserving of his own property as he thinks good and nature allows him and to punish the breach of the law of nature in others so as according to the best of his reason may most conduce to the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind so that the end and measure of this power when in every mans hands in the state of nature being the preservation of all of his societythat is all mankind in generalit can have no other end or measure when in the hands of the magistrate but to preserve the members of that society in their lives liberties and possessions and so cannot be an absolute arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes which are as much as possible to be preserved but a power to make laws and annex such penalties to them as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts and those only which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy without which no severity is lawful and this power has its original only from compact and agreement and the mutual consent of those who make up the community thirdly despotical power is an absolute arbitrary power one man has over another to take away his life whenever he pleases and this is a power which neither nature gives for it has made no such distinction between one man and another nor compact can convey for man not having such an arbitrary power over his own life cannot give another man such a power over it but it is the effect only of forfeiture which the aggressor makes of his own life when he puts himself into the state of war with another for having quitted reason which god hath given to be the rule betwixt man and man and the peaceable ways which that teaches and made use of force to compass his unjust ends upon another where he has no right he renders himself liable to be destroyed by his adversary whenever he can as any other noxious and brutish creature that is destructive to his being and thus captives taken in a just and lawful war and such only are subject to a despotical power which as it arises not from compact so neither is it capable of any but is the state of war continued for what compact can be made with a man that is not master of his own life what condition can he perform and if he be once allowed to be master of his own life the despotical arbitrary power of his master ceases he that is master of himself and his own life has a right too to the means of preserving it so that as soon as compact enters slavery ceases and he so far quits his absolute power and puts an end to the state of war who enters into conditions with his captive nature gives the first of theseviz paternal power to parents for the benefit of their children during their minority to supply their want of ability and understanding how to manage their property by property i must be understood here as in other places to mean that property which men have in their persons as well as goods voluntary agreement gives the secondviz political power to governors for the benefit of their subjects to secure them in the possession and use of their properties and forfeiture gives the thirddespotical power to lords for their own benefit over those who are stripped of all property he that shall consider the distinct rise and extent and the different ends of these several powers will plainly see that paternal power comes as far short of that of the magistrate as despotical exceeds it and that absolute dominion however placed is so far from being one kind of civil society that it is as inconsistent with it as slavery is with property paternal power is only where minority makes the child incapable to manage his property political where men have property in their own disposal and despotical over such as have no property at all of conquest though governments can originally have no other rise than that before mentioned nor polities be founded on anything but the consent of the people yet such have been the disorders ambition has filled the world with that in the noise of war which makes so great a part of the history of mankind this consent is little taken notice of and therefore many have mistaken the force of arms for the consent of the people and reckon conquest as one of the originals of government but conquest is as far from setting up any government as demolishing a house is from building a new one in the place indeed it often makes way for a new frame of a commonwealth by destroying the former but without the consent of the people can never erect a new one that the aggressor who puts himself into the state of war with another and unjustly invades another mans right can by such an unjust war never come to have a right over the conquered will be easily agreed by all men who will not think that robbers and pirates have a right of empire over whomsoever they have force enough to master or that men are bound by promises which unlawful force extorts from them should a robber break into my house and with a dagger at my throat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him would this give him any title just such a title by his sword has an unjust conqueror who forces me into submission the injury and the crime is equal whether committed by the wearer of a crown or some petty villain the title of the offender and the number of his followers make no difference in the offence unless it be to aggravate it the only difference is great robbers punish little ones to keep them in their obedience but the great ones are rewarded with laurels and triumphs because they are too big for the weak hands of justice in this world and have the power in their own possession which should punish offenders what is my remedy against a robber that so broke into my house appeal to the law for justice but perhaps justice is denied or i am crippled and cannot stir robbed and have not the means to do it if god has taken away all means of seeking remedy there is nothing left but patience but my son when able may seek the relief of the law which i am denied he or his son may renew his appeal till he recover his right but the conquered or their children have no courtno arbitrator on earth to appeal to then they may appeal as jephtha did to heaven and repeat their appeal till they have recovered the native right of their ancestors which was to have such a legislative over them as the majority should approve and freely acquiesce in if it be objected this would cause endless trouble i answer no more than justice does where she lies open to all that appeal to her he that troubles his neighbour without a cause is punished for it by the justice of the court he appeals to and he that appeals to heaven must be sure he has right on his side and a right too that is worth the trouble and cost of the appeal as he will answer at a tribunal that cannot be deceived and will be sure to retribute to every one according to the mischiefs he hath created to his fellowsubjectsthat is any part of mankind from whence it is plain that he that conquers in an unjust war can thereby have no title to the subjection and obedience of the conquered but supposing victory favours the right side let us consider a conqueror in a lawful war and see what power he gets and over whom first it is plain he gets no power by his conquest over those that conquered with him they that fought on his side cannot suffer by the conquest but must at least be as much free men as they were before and most commonly they serve upon terms and on condition to share with their leader and enjoy a part of the spoil and other advantages that attend the conquering sword or at least have a part of the subdued country bestowed upon them and the conquering people are not i hope to be slaves by conquest and wear their laurels only to show they are sacrifices to their leaders triumph they that found absolute monarchy upon the title of the sword make their heroes who are the founders of such monarchies arrant drawcansirs and forget they had any officers and soldiers that fought on their side in the battles they won or assisted them in the subduing or shared in possessing the countries they mastered we are told by some that the english monarchy is founded in the norman conquest and that our princes have thereby a title to absolute dominion which if it were true as by the history it appears otherwise and that william had a right to make war on this island yet his dominion by conquest could reach no farther than to the saxons and britons that were then inhabitants of this country the normans that came with him and helped to conquer and all descended from them are free men and no subjects by conquest let that give what dominion it will and if i or anybody else shall claim freedom as derived from them it will be very hard to prove the contrary and it is plain the law that has made no distinction between the one and the other intends not there should be any difference in their freedom or privileges but supposing which seldom happens that the conquerors and conquered never incorporate into one people under the same laws and freedom let us see next what power a lawful conqueror has over the subdued and that i say is purely despotical he has an absolute power over the lives of those who by an unjust war have forfeited them but not over the lives or fortunes of those who engaged not in the war nor over the possessions even of those who were actually engaged in it secondly i say then the conqueror gets no power but only over those who have actually assisted concurred or consented to that unjust force that is used against him for the people having given to their governors no power to do an unjust thing such as is to make an unjust war for they never had such a power in themselves they ought not to be charged as guilty of the violence and injustice that is committed in an unjust war any farther than they actually abet it no more than they are to be thought guilty of any violence or oppression their governors should use upon the people themselves or any part of their fellowsubjects they having empowered them no more to the one than to the other conquerors it is true seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction but they willingly permit the confusion of war to sweep all together but yet this alters not the right for the conquerors power over the lives of the conquered being only because they have used force to do or maintain an injustice he can have that power only over those who have concurred in that force all the rest are innocent and he has no more title over the people of that country who have done him no injury and so have made no forfeiture of their lives than he has over any other who without any injuries or provocations have lived upon fair terms with him thirdly the power a conqueror gets over those he overcomes in a just war is perfectly despotical he has an absolute power over the lives of those who by putting themselves in a state of war have forfeited them but he has not thereby a right and title to their possessions this i doubt not but at first sight will seem a strange doctrine it being so quite contrary to the practice of the world there being nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of countries than to say such an one conquered it as if conquest without any more ado conveyed a right of possession but when we consider that the practice of the strong and powerful how universal soever it may be is seldom the rule of right however it be one part of the subjection of the conquered not to argue against the conditions cut out to them by the conquering swords though in all war there be usually a complication of force and damage and the aggressor seldom fails to harm the estate when he uses force against the persons of those he makes war upon yet it is the use of force only that puts a man into the state of war for whether by force he begins the injury or else having quietly and by fraud done the injury he refuses to make reparation and by force maintains it which is the same thing as at first to have done it by force it is the unjust use of force that makes the war for he that breaks open my house and violently turns me out of doors or having peaceably got in by force keeps me out does in effect the same thing supposing we are in such a state that we have no common judge on earth whom i may appeal to and to whom we are both obliged to submit for of such i am now speaking it is the unjust use of force then that puts a man into the state of war with another and thereby he that is guilty of it makes a forfeiture of his life for quitting reason which is the rule given between man and man and using force the way of beasts he becomes liable to be destroyed by him he uses force against as any savage ravenous beast that is dangerous to his being but because the miscarriages of the father are no faults of the children who may be rational and peaceable notwithstanding the brutishness and injustice of the father the father by his miscarriages and violence can forfeit but his own life and involves not his children in his guilt or destruction his goods which nature that willeth the preservation of all mankind as much as is possible hath made to belong to the children to keep them from perishing do still continue to belong to his children for supposing them not to have joined in the war either through infancy or choice they have done nothing to forfeit them nor has the conqueror any right to take them away by the bare right of having subdued him that by force attempted his destruction though perhaps he may have some right to them to repair the damages he has sustained by the war and the defence of his own right which how far it reaches to the possessions of the conquered we shall see byandby so that he that by conquest has a right over a mans person to destroy him if he pleases has not thereby a right over his estate to possess and enjoy it for it is the brutal force the aggressor has used that gives his adversary a right to take away his life and destroy him if he pleases as a noxious creature but it is damage sustained that alone gives him title to another mans goods for though i may kill a thief that sets on me in the highway yet i may not which seems less take away his money and let him go this would be robbery on my side his force and the state of war he put himself in made him forfeit his life but gave me no title to his goods the right then of conquest extends only to the lives of those who joined in the war but not to their estates but only in order to make reparation for the damages received and the charges of the war and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and children let the conqueror have as much justice on his side as could be supposed he has no right to seize more than the vanquished could forfeit his life is at the victors mercy and his service and goods he may appropriate to make himself reparation but he cannot take the goods of his wife and children they too had a title to the goods he enjoyed and their shares in the estate he possessed for example i in the state of nature and all commonwealths are in the state of nature one with another have injured another man and refusing to give satisfaction it is come to a state of war wherein my defending by force what i had gotten unjustly makes me the aggressor i am conquered my life it is true as forfeit is at mercy but not my wifes and childrens they made not the war nor assisted in it i could not forfeit their lives they were not mine to forfeit my wife had a share in my estate that neither could i forfeit and my children also being born of me had a right to be maintained out of my labour or substance here then is the case the conqueror has a title to reparation for damages received and the children have a title to their fathers estate for their subsistence for as to the wifes share whether her own labour or compact gave her a title to it it is plain her husband could not forfeit what was hers what must be done in the case i answer the fundamental law of nature being that all as much as may be should be preserved it follows that if there be not enough fully to satisfy bothviz for the conquerors losses and childrens maintenance he that hath and to spare must remit something of his full satisfaction and give way to the pressing and preferable title of those who are in danger to perish without it but supposing the charge and damages of the war are to be made up to the conqueror to the utmost farthing and that the children of the vanquished spoiled of all their fathers goods are to be left to starve and perish yet the satisfying of what shall on this score be due to the conqueror will scarce give him a title to any country he shall conquer for the damages of war can scarce amount to the value of any considerable tract of land in any part of the world where all the land is possessed and none lies waste and if i have not taken away the conquerors land which being vanquished it is impossible i should scarce any other spoil i have done him can amount to the value of mine supposing it of an extent any way coming near what i had overrun of his and equally cultivated too the destruction of a years product or two for it seldom reaches four or five is the utmost spoil that usually can be done for as to money and such riches and treasure taken away these are none of natures goods they have but a phantastical imaginary value nature has put no such upon them they are of no more account by her standard than the wampompeke of the americans to an european prince or the silver money of europe would have been formerly to an american and five years product is not worth the perpetual inheritance of land where all is possessed and none remains waste to be taken up by him that is disseised which will be easily granted if one do but take away the imaginary value of money the disproportion being more than between five and five thousand though at the same time half a years product is more worth than the inheritance where there being more land than the inhabitants possess and make use of any one has liberty to make use of the waste but their conquerors take little care to possess themselves of the lands of the vanquished no damage therefore that men in the state of nature as all princes and governments are in reference to one another suffer from one another can give a conqueror power to dispossess the posterity of the vanquished and turn them out of that inheritance which ought to be the possession of them and their descendants to all generations the conqueror indeed will be apt to think himself master and it is the very condition of the subdued not to be able to dispute their right but if that be all it gives no other title than what bare force gives to the stronger over the weaker and by this reason he that is strongest will have a right to whatever he pleases to seize on over those then that joined with him in the war and over those of the subdued country that opposed him not and the posterity even of those that did the conqueror even in a just war hath by his conquest no right of dominion they are free from any subjection to him and if their former government be dissolved they are at liberty to begin and erect another to themselves the conqueror it is true usually by the force he has over them compels them with a sword at their breasts to stoop to his conditions and submit to such a government as he pleases to afford them but the inquiry is what right he has to do so if it be said they submit by their own consent then this allows their own consent to be necessary to give the conqueror a title to rule over them it remains only to be considered whether promises extorted by force without right can be thought consent and how far they bind to which i shall say they bind not at all because whatsoever another gets from me by force i still retain the right of and he is obliged presently to restore he that forces my horse from me ought presently to restore him and i have still a right to retake him by the same reason he that forced a promise from me ought presently to restore itie quit me of the obligation of it or i may resume it myselfie choose whether i will perform it for the law of nature laying an obligation on me only by the rules she prescribes cannot oblige me by the violation of her rules such is the extorting anything from me by force nor does it at all alter the case to say i gave my promise no more than it excuses the force and passes the right when i put my hand in my pocket and deliver my purse myself to a thief who demands it with a pistol at my breast from all which it follows that the government of a conqueror imposed by force on the subdued against whom he had no right of war or who joined not in the war against him where he had right has no obligation upon them but let us suppose that all the men of that community being all members of the same body politic may be taken to have joined in that unjust war wherein they are subdued and so their lives are at the mercy of the conqueror i say this concerns not their children who are in their minority for since a father hath not in himself a power over the life or liberty of his child no act of his can possibly forfeit it so that the children whatever may have happened to the fathers are free men and the absolute power of the conqueror reaches no farther than the persons of the men that were subdued by him and dies with them and should he govern them as slaves subjected to his absolute arbitrary power he has no such right of dominion over their children he can have no power over them but by their own consent whatever he may drive them to say or do and he has no lawful authority whilst force and not choice compels them to submission every man is born with a double right first a right of freedom to his person which no other man has a power over but the free disposal of it lies in himself secondly a right before any other man to inherit with his brethren his fathers goods by the first of these a man is naturally free from subjection to any government though he be born in a place under its jurisdiction but if he disclaim the lawful government of the country he was born in he must also quit the right that belonged to him by the laws of it and the possessions there descending to him from his ancestors if it were a government made by their consent by the second the inhabitants of any country who are descended and derive a title to their estates from those who are subdued and had a government forced upon them against their free consents retain a right to the possession of their ancestors though they consent not freely to the government whose hard conditions were by force imposed on the possessors of that country for the first conqueror never having had a title to the land of that country the people who are the descendants of or claim under those who were forced to submit to the yoke of a government by constraint have always a right to shake it off and free themselves from the usurpation or tyranny the sword hath brought in upon them till their rulers put them under such a frame of government as they willingly and of choice consent to which they can never be supposed to do till either they are put in a full state of liberty to choose their government and governors or at least till they have such standing laws to which they have by themselves or their representatives given their free consent and also till they are allowed their due property which is so to be proprietors of what they have that nobody can take away any part of it without their own consent without which men under any government are not in the state of free men but are direct slaves under the force of war and who doubts but the grecian christians descendants of the ancient possessors of that country may justly cast off the turkish yoke they have so long groaned under whenever they have a power to do it but granting that the conqueror in a just war has a right to the estates as well as power over the persons of the conquered which it is plain he hath not nothing of absolute power will follow from hence in the continuance of the government because the descendants of these being all free men if he grants them estates and possessions to inhabit his country without which it would be worth nothing whatsoever he grants them they have so far as it is granted property in the nature whereof is that without a mans own consent it cannot be taken from him their persons are free by a native right and their properties be they more or less are their own and at their own dispose and not at his or else it is no property supposing the conqueror gives to one man a thousand acres to him and his heirs for ever to another he lets a thousand acres for his life under the rent of l or l per annum has not the one of these a right to his thousand acres for ever and the other during his life paying the said rent and hath not the tenant for life a property in all that he gets over and above his rent by his labour and industry during the said term supposing it be double the rent can any one say the king or conqueror after his grant may by his power of conqueror take away all or part of the land from the heirs of one or from the other during his life he paying the rent or can he take away from either the goods or money they have got upon the said land at his pleasure if he can then all free and voluntary contracts cease and are void in the world there needs nothing but power enough to dissolve them at any time and all the grants and promises of men in power are but mockery and collusion for can there be anything more ridiculous than to say i give you and yours this for ever and that in the surest and most solemn way of conveyance can be devised and yet it is to be understood that i have right if i please to take it away from you again tomorrow i will not dispute now whether princes are exempt from the laws of their country but this i am sure they owe subjection to the laws of god and nature nobody no power can exempt them from the obligations of that eternal law those are so great and so strong in the case of promises that omnipotency itself can be tied by them grants promises and oaths are bonds that hold the almighty whatever some flatterers say to princes of the world who all together with all their people joined to them are in comparison of the great god but as a drop of the bucket or a dust on the balance inconsiderable nothing the short of the case in conquest is this the conqueror if he have a just cause has a despotical right over the persons of all that actually aided and concurred in the war against him and a right to make up his damage and cost out of their labour and estates so he injure not the right of any other over the rest of the people if there were any that consented not to the war and over the children of the captives them selves or the possessions of either he has no power and so can have by virtue of conquest no lawful title himself to dominion over them or derive it to his posterity but is an aggressor and puts himself in a state of war against them and has no better a right of principality he nor any of his successors than hingar or hubba the danes had here in england or spartacus had be conquered italy which is to have their yoke cast off as soon as god shall give those under their subjection courage and opportunity to do it thus notwithstanding whatever title the kings of assyria had over judah by the sword god assisted hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquering empire and the lord was with hezekiah and he prospered wherefore he went forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not ii kings whence it is plain that shaking off a power which force and not right hath set over any one though it hath the name of rebellion yet is no offence before god but that which he allows and countenances though even promises and covenants when obtained by force have intervened for it is very probable to any one that reads the story of ahaz and hezekiah attentively that the assyrians subdued ahaz and deposed him and made hezekiah king in his fathers lifetime and that hezekiah by agreement had done him homage and paid him tribute till this time of usurpation as conquest may be called a foreign usurpation so usurpation is a kind of domestic conquest with this differencethat an usurper can never have right on his side it being no usurpation but where one is got into the possession of what another has right to this so far as it is usurpation is a change only of persons but not of the forms and rules of the government for if the usurper extend his power beyond what of right belonged to the lawful princes or governors of the commonwealth it is tyranny added to usurpation in all lawful governments the designation of the persons who are to bear rule being as natural and necessary a part as the form of the government itself and that which had its establishment originally from the peoplethe anarchy being much alike to have no form of government at all or to agree that it shall be monarchical yet appoint no way to design the person that shall have the power and be the monarchall commonwealths therefore with the form of government established have rules also of appointing and conveying the right to those who are to have any share in the public authority and whoever gets into the exercise of any part of the power by other ways than what the laws of the community have prescribed hath no right to be obeyed though the form of the commonwealth be still preserved since he is not the person the laws have appointed and consequently not the person the people have consented to nor can such an usurper or any deriving from him ever have a title till the people are both at liberty to consent and have actually consented to allow and confirm in him the power he hath till then usurped of tyranny as usurpation is the exercise of power which another hath a right to so tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right which nobody can have a right to and this is making use of the power any one has in his hands not for the good of those who are under it but for his own private separate advantage when the governor however entitled makes not the law but his will the rule and his commands and actions are not directed to the preservation of the properties of his people but the satisfaction of his own ambition revenge covetousness or any other irregular passion if one can doubt this to be truth or reason because it comes from the obscure hand of a subject i hope the authority of a king will make it pass with him king james in his speech to the parliament tells them thus i will ever prefer the weal of the public and of the whole commonwealth in making of good laws and constitutions to any particular and private ends of mine thinking ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly felicitya point wherein a lawful king doth directly differ from a tyrant for i do acknowledge that the special and greatest point of difference that is between a rightful king and an usurping tyrant is thisthat whereas the proud and ambitious tyrant doth think his kingdom and people are only ordained for satisfaction of his desires and unreasonable appetites the righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordained for the procuring of the wealth and property of his people and again in his speech to the parliament he hath these words the king binds himself by a double oath to the observation of the fundamental laws of his kingdomtacitly as by being a king and so bound to protect as well the people as the laws of his kingdom and expressly by his oath at his coronation so as every just king in a settled kingdom is bound to observe that paction made to his people by his laws in framing his government agreeable thereunto according to that paction which god made with noah after the deluge hereafter seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease while the earth remaineth and therefore a king governing in a settled kingdom leaves to be a king and degenerates into a tyrant as soon as he leaves off to rule according to his laws and a little after therefore all kings that are not tyrants or perjured will be glad to bound themselves within the limits of their laws and they that persuade them the contrary are vipers pests both against them and the commonwealth thus that learned king who well understood the notions of things makes the difference betwixt a king and a tyrant to consist only in this that one makes the laws the bounds of his power and the good of the public the end of his government the other makes all give way to his own will and appetite it is a mistake to think this fault is proper only to monarchies other forms of government are liable to it as well as that for wherever the power that is put in any hands for the government of the people and the preservation of their properties is applied to other ends and made use of to impoverish harass or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular commands of those that have it there it presently becomes tyranny whether those that thus use it are one or many thus we read of the thirty tyrants at athens as well as one at syracuse and the intolerable dominion of the decemviri at rome was nothing better wherever law ends tyranny begins if the law be transgressed to anothers harm and whosoever in authority exceeds the power given him by the law and makes use of the force he has under his command to compass that upon the subject which the law allows not ceases in that to be a magistrate and acting without authority may be opposed as any other man who by force invades the right of another this is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates he that hath authority to seize my person in the street may be opposed as a thief and a robber if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ notwithstanding that i know he has such a warrant and such a legal authority as will empower him to arrest me abroad and why this should not hold in the highest as well as in the most inferior magistrate i would gladly be informed is it reasonable that the eldest brother because he has the greatest part of his fathers estate should thereby have a right to take away any of his younger brothers portions or that a rich man who possessed a whole country should from thence have a right to seize when he pleased the cottage and garden of his poor neighbour the being rightfully possessed of great power and riches exceedingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of adam is so far from being an excuse much less a reason for rapine and oppression which the endamaging another without authority is that it is a great aggravation of it for exceeding the bounds of authority is no more a right in a great than a petty officer no more justifiable in a king than a constable but so much the worse in him as that he has more trust put in him is supposed from the advantage of education and counsellors to have better knowledge and less reason to do it having already a greater share than the rest of his brethren may the commands then of a prince be opposed may he be resisted as often as any one shall find himself aggrieved and but imagine he has not right done him this will unhinge and overturn all polities and instead of government and order leave nothing but anarchy and confusion to this i answer that force is to be opposed to nothing but to unjust and unlawful force whoever makes any opposition in any other case draws on himself a just condemnation both from god and man and so no such danger or confusion will follow as is often suggested for first as in some countries the person of the prince by the law is sacred and so whatever he commands or does his person is still free from all question or violence not liable to force or any judicial censure or condemnation but yet opposition may be made to the illegal acts of any inferior officer or other commissioned by him unless he will by actually putting himself into a state of war with his people dissolve the government and leave them to that defence which belongs to every one in the state of nature for of such things who can tell what the end will be and a neighbour kingdom has showed the world an odd example in all other cases the sacredness of the person exempts him from all inconveniencies whereby he is secure whilst the government stands from all violence and harm whatsoever than which there cannot be a wiser constitution for the harm he can do in his own person not being likely to happen often nor to extend itself far nor being able by his single strength to subvert the laws nor oppress the body of the people should any prince have so much weakness and illnature as to be willing to do it the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs that may happen sometimes when a heady prince comes to the throne are well recompensed by the peace of the public and security of the government in the person of the chief magistrate thus set out of the reach of danger it being safer for the body that some few private men should be sometimes in danger to suffer than that the head of the republic should be easily and upon slight occasions exposed secondly but this privilege belonging only to the kings person hinders not but they may be questioned opposed and resisted who use unjust force though they pretend a commission from him which the law authorises not as is plain in the case of him that has the kings writ to arrest a man which is a full commission from the king and yet he that has it cannot break open a mans house to do it nor execute this command of the king upon certain days nor in certain places though this commission have no such exception in it but they are the limitations of the law which if any one transgress the kings commission excuses him not for the kings authority being given him only by the law he cannot empower any one to act against the law or justify him by his commission in so doing the commission or command of any magistrate where he has no authority being as void and insignificant as that of any private man the difference between the one and the other being that the magistrate has some authority so far and to such ends and the private man has none at all for it is not the commission but the authority that gives the right of acting and against the laws there can be no authority but notwithstanding such resistance the kings person and authority are still both secured and so no danger to governor or government thirdly supposing a government wherein the person of the chief magistrate is not thus sacred yet this doctrine of the lawfulness of resisting all unlawful exercises of his power will not upon every slight occasion endanger him or embroil the government for where the injured party may be relieved and his damages repaired by appeal to the law there can be no pretence for force which is only to be used where a man is intercepted from appealing to the law for nothing is to be accounted hostile force but where it leaves not the remedy of such an appeal and it is such force alone that puts him that uses it into a state of war and makes it lawful to resist him a man with a sword in his hand demands my purse on the highway when perhaps i have not d in my pocket this man i may lawfully kill to another i deliver to hold only whilst i alight which he refuses to restore me when i am got up again but draws his sword to defend the possession of it by force i endeavour to retake it the mischief this man does me is a hundred or possibly a thousand times more than the other perhaps intended me whom i killed before he really did me any and yet i might lawfully kill the one and cannot so much as hurt the other lawfully the reason whereof is plain because the one using force which threatened my life i could not have time to appeal to the law to secure it and when it was gone it was too late to appeal the law could not restore life to my dead carcass the loss was irreparable which to prevent the law of nature gave me a right to destroy him who had put himself into a state of war with me and threatened my destruction but in the other case my life not being in danger i might have the benefit of appealing to the law and have reparation for my that way fourthly but if the unlawful acts done by the magistrate be maintained by the power he has got and the remedy which is due by law be by the same power obstructed yet the right of resisting even in such manifest acts of tyranny will not suddenly or on slight occasions disturb the government for if it reach no farther than some private mens cases though they have a right to defend themselves and to recover by force what by unlawful force is taken from them yet the right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest wherein they are sure to perish it being as impossible for one or a few oppressed men to disturb the government where the body of the people do not think themselves concerned in it as for a raving madman or heady malcontent to overturn a wellsettled state the people being as little apt to follow the one as the other but if either these illegal acts have extended to the majority of the people or if the mischief and oppression has light only on some few but in such cases as the precedent and consequences seem to threaten all and they are persuaded in their consciences that their laws and with them their estates liberties and lives are in danger and perhaps their religion too how they will be hindered from resisting illegal force used against them i cannot tell this is an inconvenience i confess that attends all governments whatsoever when the governors have brought it to this pass to be generally suspected of their people the most dangerous state they can possibly put themselves in wherein they are the less to be pitied because it is so easy to be avoided it being as impossible for a governor if he really means the good of his people and the preser vation of them and their laws together not to make them see and feel it as it is for the father of a family not to let his children see he loves and takes care of them but if all the world shall observe pretences of one kind and actions of another arts used to elude the law and the trust of prerogative which is an arbitrary power in some things left in the princes hand to do good not harm to the people employed contrary to the end for which it was given if the people shall find the ministers and subordinate magistrates chosen suitable to such ends and favoured or laid by proportionably as they promote or oppose them if they see several experiments made of arbitrary power and that religion underhand favoured though publicly proclaimed against which is readiest to introduce it and the operators in it supported as much as may be and when that cannot be done yet approved still and liked the better and a long train of acting show the counsels all tending that way how can a man any more hinder himself from being persuaded in his own mind which way things are going or from casting about how to save himself than he could from believing the captain of a ship he was in was carrying him and the rest of the company to algiers when he found him always steering that course though cross winds leaks in his ship and want of men and provisions did often force him to turn his course another way for some time which he steadily returned to again as soon as the wind weather and other circumstances would let him of the dissolution of government he that will with any clearness speak of the dissolution of government ought in the first place to distinguish between the dissolution of the society and the dissolution of the government that which makes the community and brings men out of the loose state of nature into one politic society is the agreement which every one has with the rest to incorporate and act as one body and so be one distinct commonwealth the usual and almost only way whereby this union is dissolved is the inroad of foreign force making a conquest upon them for in that case not being able to maintain and support themselves as one entire and independent body the union belonging to that body which consisted therein must necessarily cease and so every one return to the state he was in before with a liberty to shift for himself and provide for his own safety as he thinks fit in some other society whenever the society is dissolved it is certain the government of that society cannot remain thus conquerors swords often cut up governments by the roots and mangle societies to pieces separating the subdued or scattered multitude from the protection of and dependence on that society which ought to have preserved them from violence the world is too well instructed in and too forward to allow of this way of dissolving of governments to need any more to be said of it and there wants not much argument to prove that where the society is dissolved the government cannot remain that being as impossible as for the frame of a house to subsist when the materials of it are scattered and displaced by a whirlwind or jumbled into a confused heap by an earthquake besides this overturning from without governments are dissolved from within first when the legislative is altered civil society being a state of peace amongst those who are of it from whom the state of war is excluded by the umpirage which they have provided in their legislative for the ending all differences that may arise amongst any of them it is in their legislative that the members of a commonwealth are united and combined together into one coherent living body this is the soul that gives form life and unity to the commonwealth from hence the several members have their mutual influence sympathy and connection and therefore when the legislative is broken or dissolved dissolution and death follows for the essence and union of the society consisting in having one will the legislative when once established by the majority has the declaring and as it were keeping of that will the constitution of the legislative is the first and fundamental act of society whereby provision is made for the continuation of their union under the direction of persons and bonds of laws made by persons authorised thereunto by the consent and appointment of the people without which no one man or number of men amongst them can have authority of making laws that shall be binding to the rest when any one or more shall take upon them to make laws whom the people have not appointed so to do they make laws without authority which the people are not therefore bound to obey by which means they come again to be out of subjection and may constitute to themselves a new legislative as they think best being in full liberty to resist the force of those who without authority would impose anything upon them every one is at the disposure of his own will when those who had by the delegation of the society the declaring of the public will are excluded from it and others usurp the place who have no such authority or delegation this being usually brought about by such in the commonwealth who misuse the power they have it is hard to consider it aright and know at whose door to lay it without knowing the form of government in which it happens let us suppose then the legislative placed in the concurrence of three distinct persons first a single hereditary person having the constant supreme executive power and with it the power of convoking and dissolving the other two within certain periods of time secondly an assembly of hereditary nobility thirdly an assembly of representatives chosen pro tempore by the people such a form of government supposed it is evident first that when such a single person or prince sets up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws which are the will of the society declared by the legislative then the legislative is changed for that being in effect the legislative whose rules and laws are put in execution and required to be obeyed when other laws are set up and other rules pretended and enforced than what the legislative constituted by the society have enacted it is plain that the legislative is changed whoever introduces new laws not being thereunto authorised by the fundamental appointment of the society or subverts the old disowns and overturns the power by which they were made and so sets up a new legislative secondly when the prince hinders the legislative from assembling in its due time or from acting freely pursuant to those ends for which it was constituted the legislative is altered for it is not a certain number of menno nor their meeting unless they have also freedom of debating and leisure of perfecting what is for the good of the society wherein the legislative consists when these are taken away or altered so as to deprive the society of the due exercise of their power the legislative is truly altered for it is not names that constitute governments but the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany them so that he who takes away the freedom or hinders the acting of the legislative in its due seasons in effect takes away the legislative and puts an end to the government thirdly when by the arbitrary power of the prince the electors or ways of election are altered without the consent and contrary to the common interest of the people there also the legislative is altered for if others than those whom the society hath authorised thereunto do choose or in another way than what the society hath prescribed those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the people fourthly the delivery also of the people into the subjection of a foreign power either by the prince or by the legislative is certainly a change of the legislative and so a dissolution of the government for the end why people entered into society being to be preserved one entire free independent society to be governed by its own laws this is lost whenever they are given up into the power of another why in such a constitution as this the dissolution of the government in these cases is to be imputed to the prince is evident because he having the force treasure and offices of the state to employ and often persuading himself or being flattered by others that as supreme magistrate he is incapable of control he alone is in a condition to make great advances towards such changes under pretence of lawful authority and has it in his hands to terrify or suppress opposers as factious seditious and enemies to the government whereas no other part of the legislative or people is capable by themselves to attempt any alteration of the legislative without open and visible rebellion apt enough to be taken notice of which when it prevails produces effects very little different from foreign conquest besides the prince in such a form of government having the power of dissolving the other parts of the legislative and thereby rendering them private persons they can never in opposition to him or without his concurrence alter the legislative by a law his consent being necessary to give any of their decrees that sanction but yet so far as the other parts of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the government and do either promote or not what lies in them hinder such designs they are guilty and partake in this which is certainly the greatest crime men can be guilty of one towards another there is one way more whereby such a government may be dissolved and that is when he who has the supreme executive power neglects and abandons that charge so that the laws already made can no longer be put in execution this is demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy and so effectively to dissolve the government for laws not being made for themselves but to be by their execution the bonds of the society to keep every part of the body politic in its due place and function when that totally ceases the government visibly ceases and the people become a confused multitude without order or connection where there is no longer the administration of justice for the securing of mens rights nor any remaining power within the community to direct the force or provide for the necessities of the public there certainly is no govern ment left where the laws cannot be executed it is all one as if there were no laws and a government without laws is i suppose a mystery in politics inconceivable to human capacity and inconsistent with human society in these and the like cases when the government is dissolved the people are at liberty to provide for themselves by erecting a new legislative differing from the other by the change of persons or form or both as they shall find it most for their safety and good for the society can never by the fault of another lose the native and original right it has to preserve itself which can only be done by a settled legislative and a fair and impartial execution of the laws made by it but the state of mankind is not so miserable that they are not capable of using this remedy till it be too late to look for any to tell people they may provide for themselves by erecting a new legislative when by oppression artifice or being delivered over to a foreign power their old one is gone is only to tell them they may expect relief when it is too late and the evil is past cure this is in effect no more than to bid them first be slaves and then to take care of their liberty and when their chains are on tell them they may act like free men this if barely so is rather mockery than relief and men can never be secure from tyranny if there be no means to escape it till they are perfectly under it and therefore it is that they have not only a right to get out of it but to prevent it there is therefore secondly another way whereby governments are dissolved and that is when the legislative or the prince either of them act contrary to their trust for the legislative acts against the trust reposed in them when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject and to make themselves or any part of the community masters or arbitrary disposers of the lives liberties or fortunes of the people the reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property and the end while they choose and authorise a legislative is that there may be laws made and rules set as guards and fences to the properties of all the society to limit the power and moderate the dominion of every part and member of the society for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure by entering into society and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making whenever the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people or to reduce them to sla very under arbitrary power they put themselves into a state of war with the people who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience and are left to the common refuge which god hath provided for all men against force and violence whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavour to grasp themselves or put into the hands of any other an absolute power over the lives liberties and estates of the people by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends and it devolves to the people who have a right to resume their original liberty and by the establishment of a new legislative such as they shall think fit provide for their own safety and security which is the end for which they are in society what i have said here concerning the legislative in general holds true also concerning the supreme executor who having a double trust put in him both to have a part in the legislative and the supreme execution of the law acts against both when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society he acts also contrary to his trust when he employs the force treasure and offices of the society to corrupt the representatives and gain them to his purposes when he openly preengages the electors and prescribes to their choice such whom he has by solicitation threats promises or otherwise won to his designs and employs them to bring in such who have promised beforehand what to vote and what to enact thus to regulate candidates and electors and new model the ways of election what is it but to cut up the government by the roots and poison the very fountain of public security for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of their representatives as the fence to their properties could do it for no other end but that they might always be freely chosen and so chosen freely act and advise as the necessity of the commonwealth and the public good should upon examination and mature debate be judged to require this those who give their votes before they hear the debate and have weighed the reasons on all sides are not capable of doing to prepare such an assembly as this and endeavour to set up the declared abettors of his own will for the true representatives of the people and the lawmakers of the society is certainly as great a breach of trust and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government as is possible to be met with to which if one shall add rewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end and all the arts of perverted law made use of to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country it will be past doubt what is doing what power they ought to have in the society who thus employ it contrary to the trust that along with it in its first institution is easy to determine and one cannot but see that he who has once attempted any such thing as this cannot any longer be trusted to this perhaps it will be said that the people being ignorant and always discontented to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people is to expose it to certain ruin and no government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up a new legislative whenever they take offence at the old one to this i answer quite the contrary people are not so easily got out of their old forms as some are apt to suggest they are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the frame they have been accustomed to and if there be any original defects or adventitious ones introduced by time or corruption it is not an easy thing to get them changed even when all the world sees there is an opportunity for it this slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitutions has in the many revolutions that have been seen in this kingdom in this and former ages still kept us to or after some interval of fruitless attempts still brought us back again to our old legislative of king lords and commons and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from some of our princes heads they never carried the people so far as to place it in another line but it will be said this hypothesis lays a ferment for frequent rebellion to which i answer first no more than any other hypothesis for when the people are made miserable and find themselves exposed to the ill usage of arbitrary power cry up their governors as much as you will for sons of jupiter let them be sacred and divine descended or authorised from heaven give them out for whom or what you please the same will happen the people generally ill treated and contrary to right will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them they will wish and seek for the opportunity which in the change weakness and accidents of human affairs seldom delays long to offer itself he must have lived but a little while in the world who has not seen examples of this in his time and he must have read very little who cannot produce examples of it in all sorts of governments in the world secondly i answer such revolutions happen not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs great mistakes in the ruling part many wrong and inconvenient laws and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without mutiny or murmur but if a long train of abuses prevarications and artifices all tending the same way make the design visible to the people and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are going it is not to be wondered that they should then rouse themselves and endeavour to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected and without which ancient names and specious forms are so far from being better that they are much worse than the state of nature or pure anarchy the inconveniencies being all as great and as near but the remedy farther off and more difficult thirdly i answer that this power in the people of providing for their safety anew by a new legislative when their legislators have acted contrary to their trust by invading their property is the best fence against rebellion and the probable means to hinder it for rebellion being an opposition not to persons but authority which is founded only in the constitutions and laws of the government those whoever they be who by force break through and by force justify their violation of them are truly and properly rebels for when men by entering into society and civil government have excluded force and introduced laws for the preservation of property peace and unity amongst themselves those who set up force again in opposition to the laws do rebellarethat is bring back again the state of war and are properly rebels which they who are in power by the pretence they have to authority the temptation of force they have in their hands and the flattery of those about them being likeliest to do the proper way to prevent the evil is to show them the danger and injustice of it who are under the greatest temptation to run into it in both the forementioned cases when either the legislative is changed or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they were constituted those who are guilty are guilty of rebellion for if any one by force takes away the established legislative of any society and the laws by them made pursuant to their trust he thereby takes away the umpirage which every one had consented to for a peaceable decision of all their controversies and a bar to the state of war amongst them they who remove or change the legislative take away this decisive power which nobody can have but by the appointment and consent of the people and so destroying the authority which the people did and nobody else can set up and introducing a power which the people hath not authorised actually introduce a state of war which is that of force without authority and thus by removing the legislative established by the society in whose decisions the people acquiesced and united as to that of their own will they untie the knot and expose the people anew to the state of war and if those who by force take away the legislative are rebels the legislators themselves as has been shown can be no less esteemed so when they who were set up for the protection and preservation of the people their liberties and properties shall by force invade and endeavour to take them away and so they putting themselves into a state of war with those who made them the protectors and guardians of their peace are properly and with the greatest aggravation rebellantes rebels but if they who say it lays a foundation for rebellion mean that it may occasion civil wars or intestine broils to tell the people they are absolved from obedience when illegal attempts are made upon their liberties or properties and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who were their magistrates when they invade their properties contrary to the trust put in them and that therefore this doctrine is not to be allowed being so destructive to the peace of the world they may as well say upon the same ground that honest men may not oppose robbers or pirates because this may occasion disorder or bloodshed if any mischief come in such cases it is not to be charged upon him who defends his own right but on him that invades his neighbours if the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he has for peace sake to him who will lay violent hands upon it i desire it may be considered what kind of a peace there will be in the world which consists only in violence and rapine and which is to be maintained only for the benefit of robbers and oppressors who would not think it an admirable peace betwixt the mighty and the mean when the lamb without resistance yielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf polyphemuss den gives us a perfect pattern of such a peace such a government wherein ulysses and his companions had nothing to do but quietly to suffer themselves to be devoured and no doubt ulysses who was a prudent man preached up passive obedience and exhorted them to a quiet submission by representing to them of what concernment peace was to mankind and by showing what inconveniencies might happen if they should offer to resist polyphemus who had now the power over them the end of government is the good of mankind and which is best for mankind that the people should be always exposed to the bound less will of tyranny or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be opposed when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power and employ it for the destruction and not the preservation of the properties of their people nor let any one say that mischief can arise from hence as often as it shall please a busy head or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the government it is true such men may stir whenever they please but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition for till the mischief be grown general and the ill designs of the rulers become visible or their attempts sensible to the greater part the people who are more disposed to suffer than right themselves by resistance are not apt to stir the examples of particular injustice or oppression of here and there an unfortunate man moves them not but if they universally have a persuasion grounded upon manifest evidence that designs are carrying on against their liberties and the general course and tendency of things cannot but give them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their governors who is to be blamed for it who can help it if they who might avoid it bring themselves into this suspicion are the people to be blamed if they have the sense of rational creatures and can think of things no otherwise than as they find and feel them and is it not rather their fault who put things in such a posture that they would not have them thought as they are i grant that the pride ambition and turbulency of private men have sometimes caused great disorders in commonwealths and factions have been fatal to states and kingdoms but whether the mischief hath oftener begun in the peoples wantonness and a desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers or in the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over their people whether oppression or disobedience gave the first rise to the disorder i leave it to impartial history to determine this i am sure whoever either ruler or subject by force goes about to invade the rights of either prince or people and lays the foundation for overturning the constitution and frame of any just government he is guilty of the greatest crime i think a man is capable of being to answer for all those mischiefs of blood rapine and desolation which the breaking to pieces of governments bring on a country and he who does it is justly to be esteemed the common enemy and pest of mankind and is to be treated accordingly that subjects or foreigners attempting by force on the properties of any people may be resisted with force is agreed on all hands but that magistrates doing the same thing may be resisted hath of late been denied as if those who had the greatest privileges and advantages by the law had thereby a power to break those laws by which alone they were set in a better place than their brethren whereas their offence is thereby the greater both as being ungrateful for the greater share they have by the law and breaking also that trust which is put into their hands by their brethren whosoever uses force without rightas every one does in society who does it without lawputs himself into a state of war with those against whom he so uses it and in that state all former ties are cancelled all other rights cease and every one has a right to defend himself and to resist the aggressor this is so evident that barclay himselfthat great assertor of the power and sacredness of kingsis forced to confess that it is lawful for the people in some cases to resist their king and that too in a chapter wherein he pretends to show that the divine law shuts up the people from all manner of rebellion whereby it is evident even by his own doctrine that since they may in some cases resist all resisting of princes is not rebellion his words are these quod siquis dicat ergone populus tyrannicae crudelitati et furori jugulum semper praebebit ergone multitudo civitates suas fame ferro et flamma vastari seque conjuges et liberos fortunae

themselves open to the cruelty and rage of tyrannymust they see their cities pillaged and laid in ashes their wives and children exposed to the tyrants lust and fury and themselves and families reduced by their king to ruin and all the miseries of want and oppression and yet sit still must men alone be debarred the common privilege of opposing force with force which nature allows so freely to all other creatures for their preservation from injury i answer selfdefence is a part of the law of nature nor can it be denied the community even against the king himself but to revenge themselves upon him must by no means be allowed them it being not agreeable to that law wherefore if the king shall show an hatred not only to some particular persons but sets himself against the body of the commonwealth whereof he is the head and shall with intolerable illusage cruelly tyrannise over the whole or a considerable part of the people in this case the people have a right to resist and defend themselves from injury but it must be with this caution that they only defend themselves but do not attack their prince they may repair the damages received but must not for any provocation exceed the bounds of due reverence and respect they may repulse the present attempt but must not revenge past violences for it is natural for us to defend life and limb but that an inferior should punish a superior is against nature the mischief which is designed them the people may prevent before it be done but when it is done they must not revenge it on the king though author of the villany this therefore is the privilege of the people in general above what any private person hath that particular men are allowed by our adversaries themselves buchanan only excepted to have no other remedy but patience but the body of the people may with respect resist intolerable tyranny for when it is but moderate they ought to endure it thus far that great advocate of monarchical power allows of resistance it is true he has annexed two limitations to it to no purpose first he says it must be with reverence secondly it must be without retribution or punishment and the reason he gives is because an inferior cannot punish a superior first how to resist force without striking again or how to strike with reverence will need some skill to make intelligible he that shall oppose an assault only with a shield to receive the blows or in any more respectful posture without a sword in his hand to abate the confidence and force of the assailant will quickly be at an end of his resistance and will find such a defence serve only to draw on himself the worse usage this is as ridiculous a way of resisting as juvenal thought it of fighting ubi tu pulsas ego vapulo tantum and the success of the combat will be unavoidably the same he there describes it libertas pauperis haec est pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti this will always be the event of such an imaginary resistance where men may not strike again he therefore who may resist must be allowed to strike and then let our author or anybody else join a knock on the head or a cut on the face with as much reverence and respect as he thinks fit he that can reconcile blows and reverence may for aught i know deserve for his pains a civil respectful cudgelling wherever he can meet with it secondly as to his secondan inferior cannot punish a superiorthat is true generally speaking whilst he is his superior but to resist force with force being the state of war that levels the parties cancels all former relation of reverence respect and superiority and then the odds that remains isthat he who opposes the unjust aggressor has this superiority over him that he has a right when he prevails to punish the offender both for the breach of the peace and all the evils that followed upon it barclay therefore in another place more coherently to himself denies it to be lawful to resist a king in any case but he there assigns two cases whereby a king may unking himself his words are quid ergo nulline casus incidere possunt quibus populo sese erigere atque in regem impotentius dominantem arma capere et invadere jure suo suaque authoritate liceat nulli certe quamdiu rex manet semper enim ex divinis id obstat regem honorificato et qui potestati resistit dei ordinationi resistit non alias igitur in eum populo potestas est quam si id committat propter quod ipso jure rex esse desinat tunc enim se ipse principatu exuit atque in privatis constituit liber hoc modo populus et superior efficitur reverso ad eum scilicet jure illo quod ante regem inauguratum in interregno habuit at sunt paucorum generum commissa ejusmodi quae hunc effectum pariunt at ego cum plurima animo perlustrem duo tantum invenio duos inquam casus quibus rex ipso facto ex rege non regem se facit et omni honore et dignitate regali atque in subditos potestate destituit quorum etiam meminit winzerus horum unus est si regnum disperdat quemadmodum de nerone fertur quod is nempe senatum populumque romanum atque adeo urbem ipsam ferro flammaque vastare ac novas sibi sedes quaerere decrevisset et de caligula quod palam denunciarit se neque civem neque principem senatui amplius fore inque animo habuerit interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo quoque alexandriam commigrare ac ut populum uno ictu interimeret unam ei cervicem optavit talia cum rex aliquis meditatur et molitur serio omnem regnandi curam et animum ilico abjicit ac proinde imperium in subditos amittit ut dominus servi pro derelicto habiti dominium arlter casus est si rex in alicujus clientelam se contulit ac regnum quod liberum a majoribus et populo traditum accepit alienae ditioni mancipavit nam tunc quamvis forte non ea mente id agit populo plane ut incommodet tamen quia quod praecipuum est regiae dignitatis amisit ut summus scilicet in regno secundum deum sit et solo deo inferior atque populum etiam totum ignorantem vel invitum cujus libertatem sartam et tectam conservare debuit in alterius gentis ditionem et potestatem dedidit hac velut quadam rengi abalienatione effecit ut nec quod ipse in regno imperium habuit retineat nec in eum cui collatum voluit juris quicquam transferat atque ita eo facto liberum jam et suae potestatis populum relinquit cujus rei exemplum unum annales scotici suppeditantbarclay contra monarchomachos i iii c which may be thus englished what then can there no case happen wherein the people may of right and by their own authority help themselves take arms and set upon their king imperiously domineering over them none at all whilst he remains a king honour the king and he that resists the power resists the ordinance of god are divine oracles that will never permit it the people therefore can never come by a power over him unless he does something that makes him cease to be a king for then he divests himself of his crown and dignity and returns to the state of a private man and the people become free and superior the power which they had in the interregnum before they crowned him king devolving to them again but there are but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this state after considering it well on all sides i can find but two two cases there are i say whereby a king ipso facto becomes no king and loses all power and regal authority over his people which are also taken notice of by winzerus the first is if he endeavour to overturn the governmentthat is if he have a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth as it is recorded of nero that he resolved to cut off the senate and people of rome lay the city waste with fire and sword and then remove to some other place and of caligula that he openly declared that he would be no longer a head to the people or senate and that he had it in his thoughts to cut off the worthiest men of both ranks and then retire to alexandria and he wished that the people had but one neck that he might dispatch them all at a blow such designs as these when any king harbours in his thoughts and seriously promotes he immediately gives up all care and thought of the commonwealth and consequently forfeits the power of governing his subjects as a master does the dominion over his slaves whom he hath abandoned the other case is when a king makes himself the dependent of another and subjects his kingdom which his ancestors left him and the people put free into his hands to the dominion of another for however perhaps it may not be his intention to prejudice the people yet because he has hereby lost the principal part of regal dignityviz to be next and immediately under god supreme in his kingdom and also because he betrayed or forced his people whose liberty he ought to have carefully preserved into the power and dominion of a foreign nation by this as it were alienation of his kingdom he himself loses the power he had in it before without transferring any the least right to those on whom he would have bestowed it and so by this act sets the people free and leaves them at their own disposal one example of this is to be found in the scotch annals in these cases barclay the great champion of absolute monarchy is forced to allow that a king may be resisted and ceases to be a king that is in shortnot to multiply casesin whatsoever he has no authority there he is no king and may be resisted for wheresoever the authority ceases the king ceases too and becomes like other men who have no authority and these two cases that he instances differ little from those above mentioned to be destructive to governments only that he has omitted the principle from which his doctrine flows and that is the breach of trust in not preserving the form of government agreed on and in not intending the end of government itself which is the public good and preservation of property when a king has dethroned himself and put himself in a state of war with his people what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no king as they would any other man who has put himself into a state of war with them barclay and those of his opinion would do well to tell us bilson a bishop of our church and a great stickler for the power and prerogative of princes does if i mistake not in his treatise of christian subjection acknowledge that princes may forfeit their power and their title to the obedience of their subjects and if there needed authority in a case where reason is so plain i could send my reader to bracton fortescue and the author of the mirror and others writers that cannot be suspected to be ignorant of our government or enemies to it but i thought hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those men who relying on him for their ecclesiastical polity are by a strange fate carried to deny those principles upon which he builds it whether they are herein made the tools of cunninger workmen to pull down their own fabric they were best look this i am sure their civil policy is so new so dangerous and so destructive to both rulers and people that as former ages never could bear the broaching of it so it may be hoped those to come redeemed from the impositions of these egyptian undertaskmasters will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers who whilst it seemed to serve their turn resolved all government into absolute tyranny and would have all men born to what their mean souls fitted themslavery here it is like the common question will be made who shall be judge whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust this perhaps illaffected and factious men may spread amongst the people when the prince only makes use of his due prerogative to this i reply the people shall be judge for who shall be judge whether his trustee or deputy acts well and according to the trust reposed in him but he who deputes him and must by having deputed him have still a power to discard him when he fails in his trust if this be reasonable in particular cases of private men why should it be otherwise in that of the greatest moment where the welfare of millions is concerned and also where the evil if not prevented is greater and the redress very difficult dear and dangerous but farther this question who shall be judge cannot mean that there is no judge at all for where there is no judicature on earth to decide controversies amongst men god in heaven is judge he alone it is true is judge of the right but every man is judge for himself as in all other cases so in this whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him and whether he should appeal to the supreme judge as jephtha did if a controversy arise betwixt a prince and some of the people in a matter where the law is silent or doubtful and the thing be of great consequence i should think the proper umpire in such a case should be the body of the people for in such cases where the prince hath a trust reposed in him and is dispensed from the common ordinary rules of the law there if any men find themselves aggrieved and think the prince acts contrary to or beyond that trust who so proper to judge as the body of the people who at first lodged that trust in him how far they meant it should extend but if the prince or whoever they be in the administration decline that way of determination the appeal then lies nowhere but to heaven force between either persons who have no known superior on earth or which permits no appeal to a judge on earth being properly a state of war wherein the appeal lies only to heaven and in that state the injured party must judge for himself when he will think fit to make use of that appeal and put himself upon it to conclude the power that every individual gave the society when he entered into it can never revert to the individuals again as long as the society lasts but will always remain in the community because without this there can be no communityno commonwealth which is contrary to the original agreement so also when the society hath placed the legislative in any assembly of men to continue in them and their successors with direction and authority for providing such successors the legislative can never revert to the people whilst that government lasts because having provided a legislative with power to continue for ever they have given up their political power to the legislative and cannot resume it but if they have set limits to the duration of their legislative and made this supreme power in any person or assembly only temporary or else when by the miscarriages of those in authority it is forfeited upon the forfeiture of their rulers or at the determination of the time set it reverts to the society and the people have a right to act as supreme and continue the legislative in themselves or place it in a new form or new hands as they think good the end notes it is no improbable opinion therefore which the archphilosopher was of that the chief person in every household was always as it were a king so when numbers of households joined themselves in civil societies together kings were the first kind of governors among them which is also as it seemeth the reason why the name of fathers continued still in them who of fathers were made rulers as also the ancient custom of governors to do as melchizedec and being kings to exercise the office of priests which fathers did at the first grew perhaps by the same occasion howbeit this is not the only kind of regimen that has been received in the world the inconveniencies of one kind have caused sundry others to be devised so that in a word all public regimen of what kind soever seemeth evidently to have risen from the deliberate advice consultation and composition between men judging it convenient and behoveful there being no impossibility in nature considered by itself but that man might have lived without any public regimen hooker eccl pol i the public power of all society is above every soul contained in the same society and the principal use of that power is to give laws unto all that are under it which laws in such cases we must obey unless there be reason showed which may necessarily enforce that the law of reason or of god doth enjoin the contrary hooker eccl pol i to take away all such mutual grievances injuries and wrongs ie such as attend men in the state of nature there was no way but only by growing into composition and agreement amongst themselves by ordaining some kind of government public and by yielding themselves subject thereunto that unto whom they granted authority to rule and govern by them the peace tranquillity and happy estate of the rest might be procured men always knew that where force and injury was offered they might be defenders of themselves they knew that however men may seek their own commodity yet if this were done with injury unto others it was not to be suffered but by all men and all good means to be withstood finally they knew that no man might in reason take upon him to determine his own right and according to his own determination proceed in maintenance thereof in as much as every man is towards himself and them whom he greatly affects partial and therefore that strifes and troubles would be end less except they gave their common consent all to be ordered by some whom they should agree upon without which consent there would be no reason that one man should take upon him to be lord or judge over another hooker ibid at the first when some certain kind of regimen was once appointed it may be that nothing was then further thought upon for the manner of governing but all permitted unto their wisdom and discretion which were to rule till by experience they found this for all parts very inconvenient so as the thing which they had devised for a remedy did indeed but increase the sore which it should have cured they saw that to live by one mans will became the cause of all mens misery this constrained them to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalties of transgressing them hooker eccl pol i civil law being the act of the whole body politic doth therefore overrule each several part of the same body hooker ibid at the first when some certain kind of regimen was once approved it may be that nothing was then further thought upon for the manner of governing but all permitted unto their wisdom and discretion which were to rule till by experience they found this for all parts very inconvenient so as the thing which they had devised for a remedy did indeed but increase the sore which it should have cured they saw that to live by one mans will became the cause of all mens misery this constrained them to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalties of transgressing them hooker eccl pol the lawful power of making laws to command whole politic societies of men belonging so properly unto the same entire societies that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of himself and not by express commission immediately and personally received from god or else by authority derived at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws it is no better than mere tyranny laws they are not therefore which public approbation hath not made so hooker ibid of this point therefore we are to note that such men naturally have no full and perfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men therefore utterly without our consent we could in such sort be at no mans commandment living and to be commanded we do consent when that society whereof we be a part hath at any time before consented without revoking the same after by the like universal agreement laws therefore human of what kind soever are available by consent hooker ibid two foundations there are which bear up public societies the one a natural inclination whereby all men desire sociable life and fellowship the other an order expressly or secretly agreed upon touching the manner of their union in living together the latter is that which we call the law of a commonweal the very soul of a politic body the parts whereof are by law animated held together and set on work in such actions as the common good requireth laws politic ordained for external order and regimen amongst men are never framed as they should be unless presuming the will of man to be inwardly obstinate rebellious and averse from all obedience to the sacred laws of his nature in a word unless presuming man to be in regard of his depraved mind little better than a wild beast they do accordingly provide notwithstanding so to frame his outward actions that they be no hindrance unto the common good for which societies are instituted unless they do this they are not perfect hooker eccl pol i human laws are measures in respect of men whose actions they must direct howbeit such measures they are as have also their higher rules to be measured by which rules are twothe law of god and the law of nature so that laws human must be made according to the general laws of nature and without contradiction to any positive law of scripture otherwise they are ill made hooker eccl pol iii to constrain men to anything inconvenient doth seem unreasonable ibid i \n"

      "a treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge wherein the chief causes of error and difficulty in the sciences with the grounds of scepticism atheism and irreligion are inquired into first printed in the year to which are added three dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to scepticks and atheists first printed in the year both written by george berkeley a fellow of trinitycollege dublin london printed for jacob tonson introduction philosophy being nothing else but the study of wisdom and truth it may with reason be expected that those who have spent most time and pains in it should enjoy a greater calm and serenity of mind a greater clearness and evidence of knowledge and be less disturbed with doubts and difficulties than other men yet so it is we see the illiterate bulk of mankind that walk the highroad of plain common sense and are governed by the dictates of nature for the most part easy and undisturbed to them nothing thats familiar appears unaccountable or difficult to comprehend they complain not of any want of evidence in their senses and are out of all danger of becoming sceptics but no sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a superior principle to reason meditate and reflect on the nature of things but a thousand scruples spring up in our minds concerning those things which before we seemed fully to comprehend prejudices and errors of sense do from all parts discover themselves to our view and endeavouring to correct these by reason we are insensibly drawn into uncouth paradoxes difficulties and inconsistencies which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in speculation till at length having wanderd through many intricate mazes we find our selves just where we were or which is worse sit down in a forlorn scepticism the cause of this is thought to be the obscurity of things or the natural weakness and imperfection of our understandings it is said the faculties we have are few and those designed by nature for the support and comfort of life and not to penetrate into the inward essence and constitution of things besides the mind of man being finite when it treats of things which partake of infinity it is not to be wondered at if it run into absurdities and contradictions out of which it is impossible it should ever extricate it self it being of the nature of infinite not to be comprehended by that which is finite but perhaps we may be too partial to our selves in placing the fault originally in our faculties and not rather in the wrong use we make of them it is a hard thing to suppose that right deductions from true principles should ever end in consequences which cannot be maintained or made consistent we should believe that god has dealt more bountifully with the sons of men than to give them a strong desire for that knowledge which he had placed quite out of their reach this were not agreeable to the wonted indulgent methods of providence which whatever appetites it may have implanted in the creatures doth usually furnish them with such means as if rightly made use of will not fail to satisfy them upon the whole i am inclined to think that the far greater part if not all of those difficulties which have hitherto amusd philosophers and blockd up the way to knowledge are intirely owing to our selves that we have first raisd a dust and then complain we cannot see my purpose therefore is to try if i can discover what those principles are which have introduced all that doubtfulness and uncertainty those absurdities and contradictions into the several sects of philosophy insomuch that the wisest men have thought our ignorance incurable conceiving it to arise from the natural dulness and limitation of our faculties and surely it is a work well deserving our pains to make a strict inquiry concerning the first principles of humane knowledge to sift and examine them on all sides especially since there may be some grounds to suspect that those lets and difficulties which stay and embarass the mind in its search after truth do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the objects or natural defect in the understanding so much as from false principles which have been insisted on and might have been avoided how difficult and discouraging soever this attempt may seem when i consider how many great and extraordinary men have gone before me in the same designs yet i am not without some hopes upon the consideration that the largest views are not always the clearest and that he who is shortsighted will be obliged to draw the object nearer and may perhaps by a close and narrow survey discern that which had escaped far better eyes in order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceiving what follows it is proper to premise somewhat by way of introduction concerning the nature and abuse of language but the unraveling this matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my design by taking notice of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering speculation intricate and perplexed and to have occasioned innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all parts of knowledge and that is the opinion that the mind hath a power of framing abstract ideas or notions of things he who is not a perfect stranger to the writings and disputes of philosophers must needs acknowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract ideas these are in a more especial manner thought to be the object of those sciences which go by the name of logic and metaphysics and of all that which passes under the notion of the most abstracted and sublime learning in all which one shall scarce find any question handled in such a manner as does not suppose their existence in the mind and that it is well acquainted with them it is agreed on all hands that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by it self and separated from all others but are mixd as it were and blended together several in the same object but we are told the mind being able to consider each quality singly or abstracted from those other qualities with which it is united does by that means frame to it self abstract ideas for example there is perceived by sight an object extended coloured and moved this mixd or compound idea the mind resolving into its simple constituent parts and viewing each by it self exclusive of the rest does frame the abstract ideas of extension colour and motion not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without extension but only that the mind can frame to it self by abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension again the mind having observed that in the particular extensions perceivd by sense there is something common and alike in all and some other things peculiar as this or that figure or magnitude which distinguish them one from another it considers apart or singles out by it self that which is common making thereof a most abstract idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid nor has any figure or magnitude but is an idea intirely prescinded from all these so likewise the mind by leaving out of the particular colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes them one from another and retaining that only which is common to all makes an idea of colour in abstract which is neither red nor blue nor white nor any other determinate colour and in like manner by considering motion abstractedly not only from the body moved but likewise from the figure it describes and all particular directions and velocities the abstract idea of motion is framed which equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever that may be perceived by sense and as the mind frames to it self abstract ideas of qualities or modes so does it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compounded beings which include several coexistent qualities for example the mind having observed that peter james and john resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities leaves out of the complex or compounded idea it has of peter james and any other particular man that which is peculiar to each retaining only what is common to all and so makes an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally partake abstracting intirely from and cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might determine it to any particular existence and after this manner it is said we come by the abstract idea of man or if you please humanity or humane nature wherein it is true there is included colour because there is no man but has some colour but then it can be neither white nor black nor any particular colour because there is no one particular colour wherein all men partake so likewise there is included stature but then it is neither tall stature nor low stature nor yet middle stature but something abstracted from all these and so of the rest moreover there being a great variety of other creatures that partake in some parts but not all of the complex idea of man the mind leaving out those parts which are peculiar to men and retaining those only which are common to all the living creatures frameth the idea of animal which abstracts not only from all particular men but also all birds beasts fishes and insects the constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal are body life sense and spontaneous motion by body is meant body without any particular shape or figure there being no one shape or figure common to all animals without covering either of hair or feathers or scales c nor yet naked hair feathers scales and nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular animals and for that reason left out of the abstract idea upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walking nor flying nor creeping it is nevertheless a motion but what that motion is it is not easy to conceive whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas they best can tell for my self i find indeed i have a faculty of imagining or representing to myself the ideas of those particular things i have perceived and of variously compounding and dividing them i can imagine a man with two heads or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse i can consider the hand the eye the nose each by it self abstracted or separated from the rest of the body but then whatever hand or eye i imagine it must have some particular shape and colour likewise the idea of man that i frame to my self must be either of a white or a black or a tawny a straight or a crooked a tall or a low or a middlesized man i cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described and it is equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving and which is neither swift nor slow curvilinear nor rectilinear and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever to be plain i own my self able to abstract in one sense as when i consider some particular parts or qualities separated from others with which though they are united in some object yet it is possible they may really exist without them but i deny that i can abstract one from another or conceive separately those qualities which it is impossible should exist so separated or that i can frame a general notion by abstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid which two last are the proper acceptations of abstraction and there are grounds to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case the generality of men which are simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions it is said they are difficult and not to be attained without pains and study we may therefore reasonably conclude that if such there be they are confined only to the learned i proceed to examine what can be alledged in defence of the doctrine of abstraction and try if i can discover what it is that inclines the men of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as that seems to be there has been a late deservedly esteemed philosopher who no doubt has given it very much countenance by seeming to think the having abstract general ideas is what puts the widest difference in point of understanding betwixt man and beast the having of general ideas saith he is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain unto for it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting or making general ideas since they have no use of words or any other general signs and a little after therefore i think we may suppose that it is in this that the species of brutes are discriminated from men and tis that proper difference wherein they are wholly separated and which at last widens to so wide a distance for if they have any ideas at all and are not bare machines as some would have them we cannot deny them to have some reason it seems as evident to me that they do some of them in certain instances reason as that they have sense but it is only in particular ideas just as they receive them from their senses they are the best of them tied up within those narrow bounds and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction essay on hum underst b sect and i readily agree with this learned author that the faculties of brutes can by no means attain to abstraction but then if this be made the distinguishing property of that sort of animals i fear a great many of those that pass for men must be reckoned into their number the reason that is here assigned why we have no grounds to think brutes have abstract general ideas is that we observe in them no use of words or any other general signs which is built on this supposition to wit that the making use of words implies the having general ideas from which it follows that men who use language are able to abstract or generalize their ideas that this is the sense and arguing of the author will further appear by his answering the question he in another place puts since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms his answer is words become general by being made the signs of general ideas essay on hum underst b sect but it seems that a word becomes general by being made the sign not of an abstract general idea but of several particular ideas any one of which it indifferently suggests to the mind for example when it is said the change of motion is proportional to the impressed force or that whatever has extension is divisible these propositions are to be understood of motion and extension in general and nevertheless it will not follow that they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without a body moved or any determinate direction and velocity or that i must conceive an abstract general idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid neither great nor small black white nor red nor of any other determinate colour it is only implied that whatever motion i consider whether it be swift or slow perpendicular horizontal or oblique or in whatever object the axiom concerning it holds equally true as does the other of every particular extension it matters not whether line surface or solid whether of this or that magnitude or figure by observing how ideas become general we may the better judge how words are made so and here it is to be noted that i do not deny absolutely there are general ideas but only that there are any abstract general ideas for in the passages above quoted wherein there is mention of general ideas it is always supposed that they are formed by abstraction after the manner set forth in sect viii and now if we will annex a meaning to our words and speak only of what we can conceive i believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which considered in it self is particular becomes general by being made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort to make this plain by an example suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts he draws for instance a black line of an inch in length this which in it self is a particular line is nevertheless with regard to its signification general since as it is there used it represents all particular lines whatsoever so that what is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines or in other words of a line in general and as that particular line becomes general by being made a sign so the name line which taken absolutely is particular by being a sign is made general and as the former owes its generality not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line but of all particular right lines that may possibly exist so the latter must be thought to derive its generality from the same cause namely the various particular lines which it indifferently denotes to give the reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas and the uses they are thought necessary to i shall add one more passage out of the essay on human understanding which is as follows abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine for example does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which is yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together it is true the mind in this imperfect state has need of such ideas and makes all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it is naturally very much inclined but yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection at least this is enough to shew that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with nor such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about b sect if any man has the faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle as is here described it is in vain to pretend to dispute him out of it nor would i go about it all i desire is that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he has such an idea or no and this methinks can be no hard task for anyone to perform what more easy than for anyone to look a little into his own thoughts and there try whether he has or can attain to have an idea that shall correspond with the description that is here given of the general idea of a triangle which is neither oblique nor rectangle equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once much is here said of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them and the pains and skill requisite to the forming them and it is on all hands agreed that there is need of great toil and labour of the mind to emancipate our thoughts from particular objects and raise them to those sublime speculations that are conversant about abstract ideas from all which the natural consequence should seem to be that so difficult a thing as the forming abstract ideas was not necessary for communication which is so easy and familiar to all sorts of men but we are told if they seem obvious and easy to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so now i would fain know at what time it is men are imployed in surmounting that difficulty and furnishing themselves with those necessary helps for discourse it cannot be when they are grown up for then it seems they are not conscious of any such painstaking it remains therefore to be the business of their childhood and surely the great and multiplied labour of framing abstract notions will be found a hard task for that tender age is it not a hard thing to imagine that a couple of children cannot prate together of their sugarplumbs and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets till they have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies and so framed in their minds abstract general ideas and annexed them to every common name they make use of nor do i think them a whit more needful for the enlargement of knowledge than for communication it is i know a point much insisted on that all knowledge and demonstration are about universal notions to which i fully agree but then it doth not appear to me that those notions are formed by abstraction in the manner premised universality so far as i can comprehend not consisting in the absolute positive nature or conception of any thing but in the relation it bears to the particulars signified or represented by it by virtue whereof it is that things names or notions being in their own nature particular are rendered universal thus when i demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles it is to be supposed that i have in view the universal idea of a triangle which ought not to be understood as if i could frame an idea of a triangle which was neither equilateral nor scalenon nor equicrural but only that the particular triangle i consider whether of this or that sort it matters not doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever and is in that sense universal all which seems very plain and not to include any difficulty in it but here it will be demanded how we can know any proposition to be true of all particular triangles except we have first seen it demonstrated of the abstract idea of a triangle which equally agrees to all for because a property may be demonstrated to agree to some one particular triangle it will not thence follow that it equally belongs to any other triangle which in all respects is not the same with it for example having demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles rectangular triangle are equal to two right ones i cannot therefore conclude this affection agrees to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal sides it seems therefore that to be certain this proposition is universally true we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular triangle which is impossible or once for all demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle in which all the particulars do indifferently partake and by which they are all equally represented to which i answer that though the idea i have in view whilst i make the demonstration be for instance that of an isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a determinate length i may nevertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or bigness soever and that because neither the right angle nor the equality nor determinate length of the sides are at all concerned in the demonstration it is true the diagram i have in view includes all these particulars but then there is not the least mention made of them in the proof of the proposition it is not said the three angles are equal to two right ones because one of them is a right angle or because the sides comprehending it are of the same length which sufficiently shews that the right angle might have been oblique and the sides unequal and for all that the demonstration have held good and for this reason it is that i conclude that to be true of any obliquangular or scalenon which i had demonstrated of a particular rightangled equicrural triangle and not because i demonstrated the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle and here it must be acknowledged that a man may consider a figure merely as triangular without attending to the particular qualities of the angles or relations of the sides so far he may abstract but this will never prove that he can frame an abstract general inconsistent idea of a triangle in like manner we may consider peter so far forth as man or so far forth as animal without framing the forementioned abstract idea either of man or of animal in as much as all that is perceived is not considered it were an endless as well as an useless thing to trace the schoolmen those great masters of abstraction through all the manifold inextricable labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of abstract natures and notions seems to have led them into what bickerings and controversies and what a learned dust have been raised about those matters and what mighty advantage hath been from thence derived to mankind are things at this day too clearly known to need being insisted on and it had been well if the ill effects of that doctrine were confined to those only who make the most avowed profession of it when men consider the great pains industry and parts that have for so many ages been laid out on the cultivation and advancement of the sciences and that notwithstanding all this the far greater part of them remain full of darkness and uncertainty and disputes that are like never to have an end and even those that are thought to be supported by the most clear and cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which are perfectly irreconcilable to the understandings of men and that taking all together a small portion of them doth supply any real benefit to mankind otherwise than by being an innocent diversion and amusement i say the consideration of all this is apt to throw them into a despondency and perfect contempt of all study but this may perhaps cease upon a view of the false principles that have obtained in the world amongst all which there is none methinks hath a more wide influence over the thoughts of speculative men than this of abstract general ideas i come now to consider the source of this prevailing notion and that seems to me to be language and surely nothing of less extent than reason it self could have been the source of an opinion so universally received the truth of this appears as from other reasons so also from the plain confession of the ablest patrons of abstract ideas who acknowledge that they are made in order to naming from which it is a clear consequence that if there had been no such thing as speech or universal signs there never had been any thought of abstraction see b sect and elsewhere of the essay on human understanding let us therefore examine the manner wherein words have contributed to the origin of that mistake first then tis thought that every name hath or ought to have one only precise and settled signification which inclines men to think there are certain abstract determinate ideas which constitute the true and only immediate signification of each general name and that it is by the mediation of these abstract ideas that a general name comes to signify any particular thing whereas in truth there is no such thing as one precise and definite signification annexed to any general name they all signifying indifferently a great number of particular ideas all which doth evidently follow from what has been already said and will clearly appear to anyone by a little reflexion to this it will be objected that every name that has a definition is thereby restrained to one certain signification for example a triangle is defined to be a plain surface comprehended by three right lines by which that name is limited to denote one certain idea and no other to which i answer that in the definition it is not said whether the surface be great or small black or white nor whether the sides are long or short equal or unequal nor with what angles they are inclined to each other in all which there may be great variety and consequently there is no one settled idea which limits the signification of the word triangle tis one thing for to keep a name constantly to the same definition and another to make it stand every where for the same idea the one is necessary the other useless and impracticable but to give a farther account how words came to produce the doctrine of abstract ideas it must be observed that it is a received opinion that language has no other end but the communicating our ideas and that every significant name stands for an idea this being so and it being withal certain that names which yet are not thought altogether insignificant do not always mark out particular conceivable ideas it is straightway concluded that they stand for abstract notions that there are many names in use amongst speculative men which do not always suggest to others determinate particular ideas is what no body will deny and a little attention will discover that it is not necessary even in the strictest reasonings significant names which stand for ideas should every time they are used excite in the understanding the ideas they are made to stand for in reading and discoursing names being for the most part used as letters are in algebra in which though a particular quantity be marked by each letter yet to proceed right it is not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to stand for besides the communicating of ideas marked by words is not the chief and only end of language as is commonly supposed there are other ends as the raising of some passion the exciting to or deterring from an action the putting the mind in some particular disposition to which the former is in many cases barely subservient and sometimes intirely omitted when these can be obtained without it as i think doth not unfrequently happen in the familiar use of language i intreat the reader to reflect with himself and see if it doth not often happen either in hearing or reading a discourse that the passions of fear love hatred admiration disdain and the like arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain words without any ideas coming between at first indeed the words might have occasioned ideas that were fit to produce those emotions but if i mistake not it will be found that when language is once grown familiar the hearing of the sounds or sight of the characters is oft immediately attended with those passions which at first were wont to be produced by the intervention of ideas that are now quite omitted may we not for example be affected with the promise of a good thing though we have not an idea of what it is or is not the being threatned with danger sufficient to excite a dread though we think not of any particular evil likely to befal us nor yet frame to our selves an idea of danger in abstract if any one shall join ever so little reflexion of his own to what has been said i believe it will evidently appear to him that general names are often used in the propriety of language without the speakers designing them for marks of ideas in his own which he would have them raise in the mind of the hearer even proper names themselves do not seem always spoken with a design to bring into our view the ideas of those individuals that are supposed to be marked by them for example when a schoolman tells me aristotle hath said it all i conceive he means by it is to dispose me to embrace his opinion with the deference and submission which custom has annexed to that name and this effect may be so instantly produced in the minds of those who are accustomed to resign their judgment to the authority of that philosopher as it is impossible any idea either of his person writings or reputation should go before innumerable examples of this kind may be given but why should i insist on those things which every ones experience will i doubt not plentifully suggest unto him we have i think shewn the impossibility of abstract ideas we have considered what has been said for them by their ablest patrons and endeavored to shew they are of no use for those ends to which they are thought necessary and lastly we have traced them to the source from whence they flow which appears to be language it cannot be denied that words are of excellent use in that by their means all that stock of knowledge which has been purchased by the joint labours of inquisitive men in all ages and nations may be drawn into the view and made the possession of one single person but at the same time it must be owned that most parts of knowledge have been strangely perplexed and darkened by the abuse of words and general ways of speech wherein they are delivered since therefore words are so apt to impose on the understanding whatever ideas i consider i shall endeavour to take them bare and naked into my view keeping out of my thoughts so far as i am able those names which long and constant use hath so strictly united with them from which i may expect to derive the following advantages first i shall be sure to get clear of all controversies purely verbal the springing up of which weeds in almost all the sciences has been a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge secondly this seems to be a sure way to extricate my self out of that fine and subtile net of abstract ideas which has so miserably perplexed and entangled the minds of men and that with this peculiar circumstance that by how much the finer and more curious was the wit of any man by so much the deeper was he like to be ensnared and faster held therein thirdly so long as i confine my thoughts to my own ideas divested of words i do not see how i can easily be mistaken the objects i consider i clearly and adequately know i cannot be deceived in thinking i have an idea which i have not it is not possible for me to imagine that any of my own ideas are alike or unlike that are not truly so to discern the agreements or disagreements there are between my ideas to see what ideas are included in any compound idea and what not there is nothing more requisite than an attentive perception of what passes in my own understanding but the attainment of all these advantages doth presuppose an intire deliverance from the deception of words which i dare hardly promise my self so difficult a thing it is to dissolve an union so early begun and confirmed by so long a habit as that betwixt words and ideas which difficulty seems to have been very much increased by the doctrine of abstraction for so long as men thought abstract ideas were annexed to their words it doth not seem strange that they should use words for ideas it being found an impracticable thing to lay aside the word and retain the abstract idea in the mind which in it self was perfectly inconceivable this seems to me the principal cause why those men who have so emphatically recommended to others the laying aside all use of words in their meditations and contemplating their bare ideas have yet failed to perform it themselves of late many have been very sensible of the absurd opinions and insignificant disputes which grow out of the abuse of words and in order to remedy these evils they advise well that we attend to the ideas signified and draw off our attention from the words which signify them but how good soever this advice may be they have given others it is plain they could not have a due regard to it themselves so long as they thought the only immediate use of words was to signify ideas and that the immediate signification of every general name was a determinate abstract idea but these being known to be mistakes a man may with greater ease prevent his being imposed on by words he that knows he has no other than particular ideas will not puzzle himself in vain to find out and conceive the abstract idea annexed to any name and he that knows names do not always stand for ideas will spare himself the labour of looking for ideas where there are none to be had it were therefore to be wished that every one would use his utmost endeavours to obtain a clear view of the ideas he would consider separating from them all that dress and incumbrance of words which so much contribute to blind the judgment and divide the attention in vain do we extend our view into the heavens and pry into the entrails of the earth in vain do we consult the writings of learned men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity we need only draw the curtain of words to behold the fairest tree of knowledge whose fruit is excellent and within the reach of our hand unless we take care to clear the first principles of knowledge from the embarras and delusion of words we may make infinite reasonings upon them to no purpose we may draw consequences from consequences and be never the wiser the farther we go we shall only lose our selves the more irrecoverably and be the deeper entangled in difficulties and mistakes whoever therefore designs to read the following sheets i intreat him to make my words the occasion of his own thinking and endeavour to attain the same train of thoughts in reading that i had in writing them by this means it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity of what i say he will be out of all danger of being deceived by my words and i do not see how he can be led into an error by considering his own naked undisguised ideas of the principles of humane knowledge part it is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of humane knowledge that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind or lastly ideas formed by help of memory and imagination either compounding dividing or barely representing those originally perceived in the aforesaid ways by sight i have the ideas of light and colours with their several degrees and variations by touch i perceive for example hard and soft heat and cold motion and resistance and of all these more and less either as to quantity or degree smelling furnishes me with odors the palate with tastes and hearing conveys sounds to the mind in all their variety of tone and composition and as several of these are observed to accompany each other they come to be marked by one name and so to be reputed as one thing thus for example a certain colour taste smell figure and consistence having been observed to go together are accounted one distinct thing signified by the name apple other collections of ideas constitute a stone a tree a book and the like sensible things which as they are pleasing or disagreeable excite the passions of love hatred joy grief and so forth but besides all that endless variety of ideas or objects of knowledge there is likewise something which knows or perceives them and exercises divers operations as willing imagining remembering about them this perceiving active being is what i call mind spirit soul or my self by which words i do not denote any one of my ideas but a thing intirely distinct from them wherein they exist or which is the same thing whereby they are perceived for the existence of an idea consists in being perceived that neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas formed by the imagination exist without the mind is what every body will allow and it seems no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense however blended or combined together that is whatever objects they compose cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them i think an intuitive knowledge may be obtained of this by any one that shall attend to what is meant by the term exist when applied to sensible things the table i write on i say exists that is i see and feel it and if i were out of my study i should say it existed meaning thereby that if i was in my study i might perceive it or that some other spirit actually does perceive it there was an odor that is it was smelled there was a sound that is to say it was heard a colour or figure and it was perceived by sight or touch this is all that i can understand by these and the like expressions for as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things without any relation to their being perceived that seems perfectly unintelligible their esse is percipi nor is it possible they should have any existence out of the minds or thinking things which perceive them it is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men that houses mountains rivers and in a word all sensible objects have an existence natural or real distinct from their being perceived by the understanding but with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertained in the world yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may if i mistake not perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction for what are the forementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these or any combination of them should exist unperceived if we thoroughly examine this tenet it will perhaps be found at bottom to depend on the doctrine of abstract ideas for can there be a nicer strain of abstraction than to distinguish the existence of sensible objects from their being perceived so as to conceive them existing unperceived light and colours heat and cold extension and figures in a word the things we see and feel what are they but so many sensations notions ideas or impressions on the sense and is it possible to separate even in thought any of these from perception for my part i might as easily divide a thing from it self i may indeed divide in my thoughts or conceive apart from each other those things which perhaps i never perceived by sense so divided thus i imagine the trunk of a humane body without the limbs or conceive the smell of a rose without thinking on the rose it self so far i will not deny i can abstract if that may properly be called abstraction which extends only to the conceiving separately such objects as it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder but my conceiving or imagining power does not extend beyond the possibility of real existence or perception hence as it is impossible for me to see or feel any thing without an actual sensation of that thing so is it impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eyes to see them such i take this important one to be to wit that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth in a word all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world have not any subsistence without a mind that their being is to be perceived or known that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me or do not exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit they must either have no existence at all or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit it being perfectly unintelligible and involving all the absurdity of abstraction to attribute to any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit to be convinced of which the reader need only reflect and try to separate in his own thoughts the being of a sensible thing from its being perceived from what has been said it follows there is not any other substance than spirit or that which perceives but for the fuller proof of this point let it be considered the sensible qualities are colour figure motion smell taste and such like that is the ideas perceived by sense now for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a manifest contradiction for to have an idea is all one as to perceive that therefore wherein colour figure and the like qualities exist must perceive them hence it is clear there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas but say you though the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind yet there may be things like them whereof they are copies or resemblances which things exist without the mind in an unthinking substance i answer an idea can be like nothing but an idea a colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure if we look but ever so little into our thoughts we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a likeness except only between our ideas again i ask whether those supposed originals or external things of which our ideas are the pictures or representations be themselves perceivable or no if they are then they are ideas and we have gained our point but if you say they are not i appeal to any one whether it be sense to assert a colour is like something which is invisible hard or soft like something which is intangible and so of the rest some there are who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities by the former they mean extension figure motion rest solidity or impenetrability and number by the latter they denote all other sensible qualities as colours sounds tastes and so forth the ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of any thing existing without the mind or unperceived but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be patterns or images of things which exist without the mind in an unthinking substance which they call matter by matter therefore we are to understand an inert senseless substance in which extension figure and motion do actually subsist but it is evident from what we have already shewn that extension figure and motion are only ideas existing in the mind and that an idea can be like nothing but another idea and that consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance hence it is plain that that the very notion of what is called matter or corporeal substance involves a contradiction in it they who assert that figure motion and the rest of the primary or original qualities do exist without the mind in unthinking substances do at the same time acknowledge that colours sounds heat cold and suchlike secondary qualities do not which they tell us are sensations existing in the mind alone that depend on and are occasioned by the different size texture and motion of the minute particles of matter this they take for an undoubted truth which they can demonstrate beyond all exception now if it be certain that those original qualities are inseparably united with the other sensible qualities and not even in thought capable of being abstracted from them it plainly follows that they exist only in the mind but i desire any one to reflect and try whether he can by any abstraction of thought conceive the extension and motion of a body without all other sensible qualities for my own part i see evidently that it is not in my power to frame an idea of a body extended and moved but i must withal give it some colour or other sensible quality which is acknowledged to exist only in the mind in short extension figure and motion abstracted from all other qualities are inconceivable where therefore the other sensible qualities are there must these be also to wit in the mind and no where else again great and small swift and slow are allowed to exist no where without the mind being intirely relative and changing as the frame or position of the organs of sense varies the extension therefore which exists without the mind is neither great nor small the motion neither swift nor slow that is they are nothing at all but say you they are extension in general and motion in general thus we see how much the tenet of extended moveable substances existing without the mind depends on that strange doctrine of abstract ideas and here i cannot but remark how nearly the vague and indeterminate description of matter or corporeal substance which the modern philosophers are run into by their own principles resembles that antiquated and so much ridiculed notion of materia prima to be met with in aristotle and his followers without extension solidity cannot be conceived since therefore it has been shewn that extension exists not in an unthinking substance the same must also be true of solidity that number is intirely the creature of the mind even though the other qualities be allowed to exist without will be evident to whoever considers that the same thing bears a different denomination of number as the mind views it with different respects thus the same extension is one or three or thirty six according as the mind considers it with reference to a yard a foot or an inch number is so visibly relative and dependent on mens understanding that it is strange to think how any one should give it an absolute existence without the mind we say one book one page one line all these are equally unites though some contain several of the others and in each instance it is plain the unite relates to some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put together by the mind unity i know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded idea accompanying all other ideas into the mind that i have any such idea answering the word unity i do not find and if i had methinks i could not miss finding it on the contrary it should be the most familiar to my understanding since it is said to accompany all other ideas and to be perceived by all the ways of sensation and reflexion to say no more it is an abstract idea i shall farther add that after the same manner as modern philosophers prove certain sensible qualities to have no existence in matter or without the mind the same thing may be likewise proved of all other sensible qualities whatsoever thus for instance it is said that heat and cold are affections only of the mind and not at all patterns of real beings existing in the corporeal substances which excite them for that the same body which appears cold to one hand seems warm to another now why may we not as well argue that figure and extension are not patterns or resemblances of qualities existing in matter because to the same eye at different stations or eyes of a different texture at the same station they appear various and cannot therefore be the images of any thing settled and determinate without the mind again it is proved that sweetness is not really in the sapid thing because the thing remaining unaltered the sweetness is changed into bitter as in case of a fever or otherwise vitiated palate is it not as reasonable to say that motion is not without the mind since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter the motion it is acknowledged shall appear slower without any alteration in any external object in short let any one consider those arguments which are thought manifestly to prove that colours and tastes exist only in the mind and he shall find they may with equal force be brought to prove the same thing of extension figure and motion though it must be confessed this method of arguing doth not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in an outward object as that we do not know by sense which is the true extension or colour of the object but the arguments foregoing plainly shew it to be impossible that any colour or extension at all or other sensible quality whatsoever should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind or in truth that there should be any such thing as an outward object but let us examine a little the received opinion it is said extension is a mode or accident of matter and that matter is the substratum that supports it now i desire that you would explain what is meant by matters supporting extension say you i have no idea of matter and therefore cannot explain it i answer though you have no positive yet if you have any meaning at all you must at least have a relative idea of matter though you know not what it is yet you must be supposed to know what relation it bears to accidents and what is meant by its supporting them it is evident support cannot here be taken in its usual or literal sense as when we say that pillars support a building in what sense therefore must it be taken if we inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare themselves to mean by material substance we shall find them acknowledge they have no other meaning annexed to those sounds but the idea of being in general together with the relative notion of its supporting accidents the general idea of being appeareth to me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other and as for its supporting accidents this as we have just now observed cannot be understood in the common sense of those words it must therefore be taken in some other sense but what that is they do not explain so that when i consider the two parts or branches which make the signification of the words material substance i am convinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them but why should we trouble our selves any farther in discussing this material substratum or support of figure and motion and other sensible qualities does it not suppose they have an existence without the mind and is not this a direct repugnancy and altogether inconceivable but though it were possible that solid figured moveable substances may exist without the mind corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies yet how is it possible for us to know this either we must know it by sense or by reason as for our senses by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations ideas or those things that are immediately perceived by sense call them what you will but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind or unperceived like to those which are perceived this the materialists themselves acknowledge it remains therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things it must be by reason inferring their existence from what is immediately perceived by sense but what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind from what we perceive since the very patrons of matter themselves do not pretend there is any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas i say it is granted on all hands and what happens in dreams phrensies and the like puts it beyond dispute that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have now though no bodies existed without resembling them hence it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas since it is granted they are produced sometimes and might possibly be produced always in the same order we see them in at present without their concurrence but though we might possibly have all our sensations without them yet perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production by supposing external bodies in their likeness rather than otherwise and so it might be at least probable there are such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds but neither can this be said for though we give the materialists their external bodies they by their own confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas are produced since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit or how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the mind hence it is evident the production of ideas or sensations in our minds can be no reason why we should suppose matter or corporeal substances since that is acknowledged to remain equally inexplicable with or without this supposition if therefore it were possible for bodies to exist without the mind yet to hold they do so must needs be a very precarious opinion since it is to suppose without any reason at all that god has created innumerable beings that are intirely useless and serve to no manner of purpose in short if there were external bodies it is impossible we should ever come to know it and if there were not we might have the very same reasons to think there were that we have now suppose what no one can deny possible an intelligence without the help of external bodies to be affected with the same train of sensations or ideas that you are imprinted in the same order and with like vividness in his mind i ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances represented by his ideas and exciting them in his mind that you can possibly have for believing the same thing of this there can be no question which one consideration is enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever arguments be may think himself to have for the existence of bodies without the mind were it necessary to add any farther proof against the existence of matter after what has been said i could instance several of those errors and difficulties not to mention impieties which have sprung from that tenet it has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in philosophy and not a few of far greater moment in religion but i shall not enter into the detail of them in this place as well because i think arguments a posteriori are unnecessary for confirming what has been if i mistake not sufficiently demonstrated a priori as because i shall hereafter find occasion to say somewhat of them i am afraid i have given cause to think me needlesly prolix in handling this subject for to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two to any one that is capable of the least reflexion it is but looking into your own thoughts and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound or figure or motion or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived this easy trial may make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction insomuch that i am content to put the whole upon this issue if you can but conceive it possible for one extended moveable substance or in general for any one idea or any thing like an idea to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it i shall readily give up the cause and as for all that compages of external bodies which you contend for i shall grant you its existence though you cannot either give me any reason why you believe it exists or assign any use to it when it is supposed to exist i say the bare possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that it is so but say you surely there is nothing easier than to imagine trees for instance in a park or books existing in a closet and no body by to perceive them i answer you may so there is no difficulty in it but what is all this i beseech you more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call books and trees and the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them but do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while this therefore is nothing to the purpose it only shews you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind to make out this it is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceived or unthought of which is a manifest repugnancy when we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas but the mind taking no notice of it self is deluded to think it can and doth conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind though at the same time they are apprehended by or exist in it self a little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of material substance it is very obvious upon the least inquiry into our own thoughts to know whether it be possible for us to understand what is meant by the absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves or without the mind to me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction or else nothing at all and to convince others of this i know no readier or fairer way than to intreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions does appear surely nothing more is requisite for their conviction it is on this therefore that i insist to wit that the absolute existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning or which include a contradiction this is what i repeat and inculcate and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader all our ideas sensations or the things which we perceive by whatsoever names they may be distinguished are visibly inactive there is nothing of power or agency included in them so that one idea or object of thought cannot produce or make any alteration in another to be satisfied of the truth of this there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas for since they and every part of them exist only in the mind it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived but whoever shall attend to his ideas whether of sense or reflexion will not perceive in them any power or activity there is therefore no such thing contained in them a little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do any thing or strictly speaking to be the cause of any thing neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being as is evident from sect whence it plainly follows that extension figure and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations to say therefore that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration number motion and size of corpuscles must certainly be false we perceive a continual succession of ideas some are anew excited others are changed or totally disappear there is therefore some cause of these ideas whereon they depend and which produces and changes them that this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of ideas is clear from the preceding section it must therefore be a substance but it has been shewn that there is no corporeal or material substance it remains therefore that the cause of ideas is an incorporeal active substance or spirit a spirit is one simple undivided active being as it perceives ideas it is called the understanding and as it produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the will hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit for all ideas whatever being passive and inert vide sect they cannot represent unto us by way of image or likeness that which acts a little attention will make it plain to any one that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible such is the nature of spirit or that which acts that it cannot be of it self perceived but only by the effects which it produceth if any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active being and whether he hath ideas of two principal powers marked by the names will and understanding distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of substance or being in general with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid powers which is signified by the name soul or spirit this is what some hold but so far as i can see the words will soul spirit do not stand for different ideas or in truth for any idea at all but for something which is very different from ideas and which being an agent cannot be like unto or represented by any idea whatsoever though it must be owned at the same time that we have some notion of soul spirit and the operations of the mind such as willing loving hating in as much as we know or understand the meaning of those words i find i can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure and vary and shift the scene as oft as i think fit it is no more than willing and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another this making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active thus much is certain and grounded on experience but when we think of unthinking agents or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition we only amuse our selves with words but whatever power i may have over my own thoughts i find the ideas actually perceived by sense have not a like dependence on my will when in broad daylight i open my eyes it is not in my power to choose whether i shall see or no or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will there is therefore some other will or spirit that produces them the ideas of sense are more strong lively and distinct than those of the imagination they have likewise a steddiness order and coherence and are not excited at random as those which are the effects of humane wills often are but in a regular train or series the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its author now the set rules or established methods wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the ideas of sense are called the laws of nature and these we learn by experience which teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas in the ordinary course of things this gives us a sort of foresight which enables us to regulate our actions for the benefit of life and without this we should be eternally at a loss we could not know how to act any thing that might procure us the least pleasure or remove the least pain of sense that food nourishes sleep refreshes and fire warms us that to sow in the seedtime is the way to reap in the harvest and in general that to obtain such or such ends such or such means are conducive all this we know not by discovering any necessary connexion between our ideas but only by the observation of the settled laws of nature without which we should be all in uncertainty and confusion and a grown man no more know how to manage himself in the affairs of life than an infant just born and yet this consistent uniform working which so evidently displays the goodness and wisdom of that governing spirit whose will constitutes the laws of nature is so far from leading our thoughts to him that it rather sends them a wandering after second causes for when we perceive certain ideas of sense constantly followed by other ideas and we know this is not of our own doing we forthwith attribute power and agency to the ideas themselves and make one the cause of another than which nothing can be more absurd and unintelligible thus for example having observed that when we perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure we at the same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation called heat we do from thence conclude the sun to be the cause of heat and in like manner perceiving the motion and collision of bodies to be attended with sound we are inclined to think the latter an effect of the former the ideas imprinted on the senses by the author of nature are called real things and those excited in the imagination being less regular vivid and constant are more properly termed ideas or images of things which they copy and represent but then our sensations be they never so vivid and distinct are nevertheless ideas that is they exist in the mind or are perceived by it as truly as the ideas of its own framing the ideas of sense are allowed to have more reality in them that is to be more strong orderly and coherent than the creatures of the mind but this is no argument that they exist without the mind they are also less dependent on the spirit or thinking substance which perceives them in that they are excited by the will of another and more powerful spirit yet still they are ideas and certainly no idea whether faint or strong can exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it before we proceed any farther it is necessary to spend some time in answering objections which may probably be made against the principles hitherto laid down in doing of which if i seem too prolix to those of quick apprehensions i hope it may be pardoned since all men do not equally apprehend things of this nature and i am willing to be understood by every one first then it will be objected that by the foregoing principles all that is real and substantial in nature is banished out of the world and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas takes place all things that exist exist only in the mind that is they are purely notional what therefore becomes of the sun moon and stars what must we think of houses rivers mountains trees stones nay even of our own bodies are all these but so many chimeras and illusions on the fancy to all which and whatever else of the same sort may be objected i answer that by the principles premised we are not deprived of any one thing in nature whatever we see feel hear or any wise conceive or understand remains as secure as ever and is as real as ever there is a rerum natura and the distinction between realities and chimeras retains its full force this is evident from sect and where we have shewn what is meant by real things in opposition to chimeras or ideas of our own framing but then they both equally exist in the mind and in that sense they are alike ideas i do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend either by sense or reflexion that the things i see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist really exist i make not the least question the only thing whose existence we deny is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance and in doing of this there is no damage done to the rest of mankind who i dare say will never miss it the atheist indeed will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety and the philosophers may possibly find they have lost a great handle for trifling and disputation if any man thinks this detracts from the existence or reality of things he is very far from understanding what hath been premised in the plainest terms i could think of take here an abstract of what has been said there are spiritual substances minds or humane souls which will or excite ideas in themselves at pleasure but these are faint weak and unsteady in respect of others they perceive by sense which being impressed upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature speak themselves the effects of a mind more powerful and wise than humane spirits these latter are said to have more reality in them than the former by which is meant that they are more affecting orderly and distinct and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them and in this sense the sun that i see by day is the real sun and that which i imagine by night is the idea of the former in the sense here given of reality it is evident that every vegetable star mineral and in general each part of the mundane system is as much a real being by our principles as by any other whether others mean any thing by the term reality different from what i do i intreat them to look into their own thoughts and see it will be urged that thus much at least is true to wit that we take away all corporeal substances to this my answer is that if the word substance be taken in the vulgar sense for a combination of sensible qualities such as extension solidity weight and the like this we cannot be accused of taking away but if it be taken in a philosophic sense for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind then indeed i acknowledge that we take it away if one may be said to take away that which never had any existence not even in the imagination but say you it sounds very harsh to say we eat and drink ideas and are clothed with ideas i acknowledge it does so the word idea not being used in common discourse to signify the several combinations of sensible qualities which are called things and it is certain that any expression which varies from the familiar use of language will seem harsh and ridiculous but this doth not concern the truth of the proposition which in other words is no more than to say we are fed and clothed with those things which we perceive immediately by our senses the hardness or softness the colour taste warmth figure and such like qualities which combined together constitute the several sorts of victuals and apparel have been shewn to exist only in the mind that perceives them and this is all that is meant by calling them ideas which word if it was as ordinarily used as thing would sound no harsher nor more ridiculous than it i am not for disputing about the propriety but the truth of the expression if therefore you agree with me that we eat and drink and are clad with the immediate objects of sense which cannot exist unperceived or without the mind i shall readily grant it is more proper or conformable to custom that they should be called things rather than ideas if it be demanded why i make use of the word idea and do not rather in compliance with custom call them things i answer i do it for two reasons first because the term thing in contradistinction to idea is generally supposed to denote somewhat existing without the mind secondly because thing hath a more comprehensive signification than idea including spirits or thinking things as well as ideas since therefore the objects of sense exist only in the mind and are withal thoughtless and inactive i chose to mark them by the word idea which implies those properties but say what we can some one perhaps may be apt to reply he will still believe his senses and never suffer any arguments how plausible soever to prevail over the certainty of them be it so assert the evidence of sense as high as you please we are willing to do the same that what i see hear and feel doth exist that is to say is perceived by me i no more doubt than i do of my own being but i do not see how the testimony of sense can be alledged as a proof for the existence of any thing which is not perceived by sense we are not for having any man turn sceptic and disbelieve his senses on the contrary we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable nor are there any principles more opposite to scepticism than those we have laid down as shall be hereafter clearly shewn secondly it will be objected that there is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance and the idea of fire betwixt dreaming or imagining ones self burnt and actually being so this and the like may be urged in opposition to our tenets to all which the answer is evident from what hath been already said and i shall only add in this place that if real fire be very different from the idea of fire so also is the real pain that it occasions very different from the idea of the same pain and yet no body will pretend that real pain either is or can possibly be in an unperceiving thing or without the mind any more than its idea thirdly it will be objected that we see things actually without or at distance from us and which consequently do not exist in the mind it being absurd that those things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts in answer to this i desire it may be considered that in a dream we do oft perceive things as existing at a great distance off and yet for all that those things are acknowledged to have their existence only in the mind but for the fuller clearing of this point it may be worth while to consider how it is that we perceive distance and things placed at a distance by sight for that we should in truth see external space and bodies actually existing in it some nearer others farther off seems to carry with it some opposition to what hath been said of their existing no where without the mind the consideration of this difficulty it was that gave birth to my essay towards a new theory of vision which was published not long since wherein it is shewn that distance or outness is neither immediately of it self perceived by sight nor yet apprehended or judged of by lines and angles or any thing that hath a necessary connexion with it but that it is only suggested to our thoughts by certain visible ideas and sensations attending vision which in their own nature have no manner of similitude or relation either with distance or things placed at a distance but by a connexion taught us by experience they come to signify and suggest them to us after the same manner that words of any language suggest the ideas they are made to stand for insomuch that a man born blind and afterwards made to see would not at first sight think the things he saw to be without his mind or at any distance from him see sect of the forementioned treatise the ideas of sight and touch make two species intirely distinct and heterogeneous the former are marks and prognostics of the latter that the proper objects of sight neither exist without the mind nor are the images of external things was shewn even in that treatise though throughout the same the contrary be supposed true of tangible objects not that to suppose that vulgar error was necessary for establishing the notion therein laid down but because it was beside my purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concerning vision so that in strict truth the ideas of sight when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time and in consequence of such or such actions it is i say evident from what has been said in the foregoing parts of this treatise and in sect and elsewhere of the essay concerning vision that visible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit on whom we depend informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies but for a fuller information in this point i refer to the essay it self fourthly it will be objected that from the foregoing principles it follows things are every moment annihilated and created anew the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived the trees therefore are in the garden or the chairs in the parlour no longer than while there is some body by to perceive them upon shutting my eyes all the furniture in the room is reduced to nothing and barely upon opening them it is again created in answer to all which i refer the reader to what has been said in sect c and desire he will consider whether he means any thing by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its being perceived for my part after the nicest inquiry i could make i am not able to discover that any thing else is meant by those words and i once more intreat the reader to sound his own thoughts and not suffer himself to be imposed on by words if he can conceive it possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without being perceived then i give up the cause but if he cannot he will acknowledge it is unreasonable for him to stand up in defence of he knows not what and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity the not assenting to those propositions which at bottom have no meaning in them it will not be amiss to observe how far the received principles of philosophy are themselves chargeable with those pretended absurdities it is thought strangely absurd that upon closing my eyelids all the visible objects round me should be reduced to nothing and yet is not this what philosophers commonly acknowledge when they agree on all hands that light and colours which alone are the proper and immediate objects of sight are mere sensations that exist no longer than they are perceived again it may to some perhaps seem very incredible that things should be every moment creating yet this very notion is commonly taught in the schools for the schoolmen though they acknowledge the existence of matter and that the whole mundane fabrick is framed out of it are nevertheless of opinion that it cannot subsist without the divine conservation which by them is expounded to be a continual creation farther a little thought will discover to us that though we allow the existence of matter or corporeal substance yet it will unavoidably follow from the principles which are now generally admitted that the particular bodies of what kind soever do none of them exist whilst they are not perceived for it is evident from sect and the following sections that the matter philosophers contend for is an incomprehensible somewhat which hath none of those particular qualities whereby the bodies falling under our senses are distinguished one from another but to make this more plain it must be remarked that the infinite divisibility of matter is now universally allowed at least by the most approved and considerable philosophers who on the received principles demonstrate it beyond all exception hence it follows that there is an infinite number of parts in each particle of matter which are not perceived by sense the reason therefore that any particular body seems to be of a finite magnitude or exhibits only a finite number of parts to sense is not because it contains no more since in itself it contains an infinite number of parts but because the sense is not acute enough to discern them in proportion therefore as the sense is rendered more acute it perceives a greater number of parts in the object that is the object appears greater and its figure varies those parts in its extremities which were before unperceivable appearing now to bound it in very different lines and angles from those perceived by an obtuser sense and at length after various changes of size and shape when the sense becomes infinitely acute the body shall seem infinite during all which there is no alteration in the body but only in the sense each body therefore considered in it self is infinitely extended and consequently void of all shape or figure from which it follows that though we should grant the existence of matter to be ever so certain yet it is withal as certain the materialists themselves are by their own principles forced to acknowledge that neither the particular bodies perceived by sense nor any thing like them exists without the mind matter i say and each particle thereof is according to them infinite and shapeless and it is the mind that frames all that variety of bodies which compose the visible world any one whereof does not exist longer than it is perceived if we consider it the objection proposed in sect will not be found reasonably charged on the principles we have premised so as in truth to make any objection at all against our notions for though we hold indeed the objects of sense to be nothing else but ideas which cannot exist unperceived yet we may not hence conclude they have no existence except only while they are perceived by us since there may be some other spirit that perceives them though we do not wherever bodies are said to have no existence without the mind i would not be understood to mean this or that particular mind but all minds whatsoever it does not therefore follow from the foregoing principles that bodies are annihilated and created every moment or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception of them fifthly it may perhaps be objected that if extension and figure exist only in the mind it follows that the mind is extended and figured since extension is a mode or attribute which to speak with the schools is predicated of the subject in which it exists i answer those qualities are in the mind only as they are perceived by it that is not by way of mode or attribute but only by way of idea and it no more follows that the soul or mind is extended because extension exists in it alone than it does that it is red or blue because those colours are on all hands acknowledged to exist in it and no where else as to what philosophers say of subject and mode that seems very groundless and unintelligible for instance in this proposition a die is hard extended and square they will have it that the word die denotes a subject or substance distinct from the hardness extension and figure which are predicated of it and in which they exist this i cannot comprehend to me a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things which are termed its modes or accidents and to say a die is hard extended and square is not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and supporting them but only an explication of the meaning of the word die sixthly you will say there have been a great many things explained by matter and motion take away these and you destroy the whole corpuscular philosophy and undermine those mechanical principles which have been applied with so much success to account for the phænomena in short whatever advances have been made either by ancient or modern philosophers in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition that corporeal substance or matter doth really exist to this i answer that there is not any one phænomenon explained on that supposition which may not as well be explained without it as might easily be made appear by an induction of particulars to explain the phænomena is all one as to shew why upon such and such occasions we are affected with such and such ideas but how matter should operate on a spirit or produce any idea in it is what no philosopher will pretend to explain it is therefore evident there can be no use of matter in natural philosophy besides they who attempt to account for things do it not by corporeal substance but by figure motion and other qualities which are in truth no more than mere ideas and therefore cannot be the cause of any thing as hath been already shewn see sect seventhly it will upon this be demanded whether it does not seem absurd to take away natural causes and ascribe every thing to the immediate operation of spirits we must no longer say upon these principles that fire heats or water cools but that a spirit heats and so forth would not a man be deservedly laught at who should talk after this manner i answer he would so in such things we ought to think with the learned and speak with the vulgar they who to demonstration are convinced of the truth of the copernican system do nevertheless say the sun rises the sun sets or comes to the meridian and if they affected a contrary stile in common talk it would without doubt appear very ridiculous a little reflexion on what is here said will make it manifest that the common use of language would receive no manner of alteration or disturbance from the admission of our tenets in the ordinary affairs of life any phrases may be retained so long as they excite in us proper sentiments or dispositions to act in such a manner as is necessary for our wellbeing how false soever they may be if taken in a strict and speculative sense nay this is unavoidable since propriety being regulated by custom language is suited to the received opinions which are not always the truest hence it is impossible even in the most rigid philosophic reasonings so far to alter the bent and genius of the tongue we speak as never to give a handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsistencies but a fair and ingenuous reader will collect the sense from the scope and tenor and connexion of a discourse making allowances for those inaccurate modes of speech which use has made inevitable as to the opinion that there are no corporeal causes this has been heretofore maintained by some of the schoolmen as it is of late by others among the modern philosophers who though they allow matter to exist yet will have god alone to be the immediate efficient cause of all things these men saw that amongst all the objects of sense there was none which had any power or activity included in it and that by consequence this was likewise true of whatever bodies they supposed to exist without the mind like unto the immediate objects of sense but then that they should suppose an innumerable multitude of created beings which they acknowledge are not capable of producing any one effect in nature and which therefore are made to no manner of purpose since god might have done every thing as well without them this i say though we should allow it possible must yet be a very unaccountable and extravagant supposition in the eighth place the universal concurrent assent of mankind may be thought by some an invincible argument in behalf of matter or the existence of external things must we suppose the whole world to be mistaken and if so what cause can be assigned of so widespread and predominant an error i answer first that upon a narrow inquiry it will not perhaps be found so many as is imagined do really believe the existence of matter or things without the mind strictly speaking to believe that which involves a contradiction or has no meaning in it is impossible and whether the foregoing expressions are not of that sort i refer it to the impartial examination of the reader in one sense indeed men may be said to believe that matter exists that is they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations which affects them every moment and is so nearly present to them were some senseless unthinking being but that they should clearly apprehend any meaning marked by those words and form thereof a settled speculative opinion is what i am not able to conceive this is not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves by imagining they believe those propositions they have often heard though at bottom they have no meaning in them but secondly though we should grant a notion to be ever so universally and stedfastly adhered to yet this is but a weak argument of its truth to whoever considers what a vast number of prejudices and false opinions are every where embraced with the utmost tenaciousness by the unreflecting which are the far greater part of mankind there was a time when the antipodes and motion of the earth were looked upon as monstrous absurdities even by men of learning and if it be considered what a small proportion they bear to the rest of mankind we shall find that at this day those notions have gained but a very inconsiderable footing in the world but it is demanded that we assign a cause of this prejudice and account for its obtaining in the world to this i answer that men knowing they perceived several ideas whereof they themselves were not the authors as not being excited from within nor depending on the operation of their wills this made them maintain those ideas or objects of perception had an existence independent of and without the mind without ever dreaming that a contradiction was involved in those words but philosophers having plainly seen that the immediate objects of perception do not exist without the mind they in some degree corrected the mistake of the vulgar but at the same time run into another which seems no less absurd to wit that there are certain objects really existing without the mind or having a subsistence distinct from being perceived of which our ideas are only images or resemblances imprinted by those objects on the mind and this notion of the philosophers owes its origin to the same cause with the former namely their being conscious that they were not the authors of their own sensations which they evidently knew were imprinted from without and which therefore must have some cause distinct from the minds on which they are imprinted but why they should suppose the ideas of sense to be excited in us by things in their likeness and not rather have recourse to spirit which alone can act may be accounted for first because they were not aware of the repugnancy there is as well in supposing things like unto our ideas existing without as in attributing to them power or activity secondly because the supreme spirit which excites those ideas in our minds is not marked out and limited to our view by any particular finite collection of sensible ideas as humane agents are by their size complexion limbs and motions and thirdly because his operations are regular and uniform whenever the course of nature is interrupted by a miracle men are ready to own the presence of a superior agent but when we see things go on in the ordinary course they do not excite in us any reflexion their order and concatenation though it be an argument of the greatest wisdom power and goodness in their creator is yet so constant and familiar to us that we do not think them the immediate effects of a free spirit especially since inconstancy and mutability in acting though it be an imperfection is looked on as a mark of freedom tenthly it will be objected that the notions we advance are inconsistent with several sound truths in philosophy and mathematicks for example the motion of the earth is now universally admitted by astronomers as a truth grounded on the clearest and most convincing reasons but on the foregoing principles there can be no such thing for motion being only an idea it follows that if it be not perceived it exists not but the motion of the earth is not perceived by sense i answer that tenet if rightly understood will be found to agree with the principles we have premised for the question whether the earth moves or no amounts in reality to no more than this to wit whether we have reason to conclude from what hath been observed by astronomers that if we were placed in such and such circumstances and such or such a position and distance both from the earth and sun we should perceive the former to move among the choir of the planets and appearing in all respects like one of them and this by the established rules of nature which we have no reason to mistrust is reasonably collected from the phænomena we may from the experience we have had of the train and succession of ideas in our minds often make i will not say uncertain conjectures but sure and wellgrounded predictions concerning the ideas we shall be affected with pursuant to a great train of actions and be enabled to pass a right judgment of what would have appeared to us in case we were placed in circumstances very different from those we are in at present herein consists the knowledge of nature which may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath been said it will be easy to apply this to whatever objections of the like sort may be drawn from the magnitude of the stars or any other discoveries in astronomy or nature in the eleventh place it will be demanded to what purpose serves that curious organization of plants and the admirable mechanism in the parts of animals might not vegetables grow and shoot forth leaves and blossoms and animals perform all their motions as well without as with all that variety of internal parts so elegantly contrived and put together which being ideas have nothing powerful or operative in them nor have any necessary connexion with the effects ascribed to them if it be a spirit that immediately produces every effect by a fiat or act of his will we must think all that is fine and artificial in the works whether of man or nature to be made in vain by this doctrine though an artist hath made the spring and wheels and every movement of a watch and adjusted them in such a manner as he knew would produce the motions he designed yet he must think all this done to no purpose and that it is an intelligence which directs the index and points to the hour of the day if so why may not the intelligence do it without his being at the pains of making the movements and putting them together why does not an empty case serve as well as another and how comes it to pass that whenever there is any fault in the going of a watch there is some corresponding disorder to be found in the movements which being mended by a skilful hand all is right again the like may be said of all the clockwork of nature great part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtile as scarce to be discerned by the best microscope in short it will be asked how upon our principles any tolerable account can be given or any final cause assigned of an innumerable multitude of bodies and machines framed with the most exquisite art which in the common philosophy have very apposite uses assigned them and serve to explain abundance of phænomena to all which i answer first that though there were some difficulties relating to the administration of providence and the uses by it assigned to the several parts of nature which i could not solve by the foregoing principles yet this objection could be of small weight against the truth and certainty of those things which may be proved a priori with the utmost evidence secondly but neither are the received principles free from the like difficulties for it may still be demanded to what end god should take those roundabout methods of effecting things by instruments and machines which no one can deny might have been effected by the mere command of his will without all that apparatus nay if we narrowly consider it we shall find the objection may be retorted with greater force on those who hold the existence of those machines without the mind for it has been made evident that solidity bulk figure motion and the like have no activity or efficacy in them so as to be capable of producing any one effect in nature see sect whoever therefore supposes them to exist allowing the supposition possible when they are not perceived does it manifestly to no purpose since the only use that is assigned to them as they exist unperceived is that they produce those perceivable effects which in truth cannot be ascribed to any thing but spirit but to come nearer the difficulty it must be observed that though the fabrication of all those parts and organs be not absolutely necessary to the producing any effect yet it is necessary to the producing of things in a constant regular way according to the laws of nature there are certain general laws that run through the whole chain of natural effects these are learned by the observation and study of nature and are by men applied as well to the framing artificial things for the use and ornament of life as to the explaining the various phænomena which explication consists only in shewing the conformity any particular phænomenon hath to the general laws of nature or which is the same thing in discovering the uniformity there is in the production of natural effects as will be evident to whoever shall attend to the several instances wherein philosophers pretend to account for appearances that there is a great and conspicuous use in these regular constant methods of working observed by the supreme agent hath been shewn in sect and it is no less visible that a particular size figure motion and disposition of parts are necessary though not absolutely to the producing any effect yet to the producing it according to the standing mechanical laws of nature thus for instance it cannot be denied that god or the intelligence which sustains and rules the ordinary course of things might if he were minded to produce a miracle cause all the motions on the dialplate of a watch though no body had ever made the movements and put them in it but yet if he will act agreeably to the rules of mechanism by him for wise ends established and maintained in the creation it is necessary that those actions of the watchmaker whereby he makes the movements and rightly adjusts them precede the production of the aforesaid motions as also that any disorder in them be attended with the perception of some corresponding disorder in the movements which being once corrected all is right again it may indeed on some occasions be necessary that the author of nature display his overruling power in producing some appearance out of the ordinary series of things such exceptions from the general rules of nature are proper to surprise and awe men into an acknowledgment of the divine being but then they are to be used but seldom otherwise there is a plain reason why they should fail of that effect besides god seems to choose the convincing our reason of his attributes by the works of nature which discover so much harmony and contrivance in their make and are such plain indications of wisdom and beneficence in their author rather than to astonish us into a belief of his being by anomalous and surprising events to set this matter in a yet clearer light i shall observe that what has been objected in sect amounts in reality to no more than this ideas are not any how and at random produced there being a certain order and connexion between them like to that of cause and effect there are also several combinations of them made in a very regular and artificial manner which seem like so many instruments in the hand of nature that being hid as it were behind the scenes have a secret operation in producing those appearances which are seen on the theatre of the world being themselves discernible only to the curious eye of the philosopher but since one idea cannot be the cause of another to what purpose is that connexion and since those instruments being barely inefficacious perceptions in the mind are not subservient to the production of natural effects it is demanded why they are made or in other words what reason can be assigned why god should make us upon a close inspection into his works behold so great variety of ideas so artfully laid together and so much according to rule it not being credible that he would be at the expense if one may so speak of all that art and regularity to no purpose to all which my answer is first that the connexion of ideas does not imply the relation of cause and effect but only of a mark or sign with the thing signified the fire which i see is not the cause of the pain i suffer upon my approaching it but the mark that forewarns me of it in like manner the noise that i hear is not the effect of this or that motion or collision of the ambient bodies but the sign thereof secondly the reason why ideas are formed into machines that is artificial and regular combinations is the same with that for combining letters into words that a few original ideas may be made to signify a great number of effects and actions it is necessary they be variously combined together and to the end their use be permanent and universal these combinations must be made by rule and with wise contrivance by this means abundance of information is conveyed unto us concerning what we are to expect from such and such actions and what methods are proper to be taken for the exciting such and such ideas which in effect is all that i conceive to be distinctly meant when it is said that by discerning the figure texture and mechanism of the inward parts of bodies whether natural or artificial we may attain to know the several uses and properties depending thereon or the nature of the thing hence it is evident that those things which under the notion of a cause cooperating or concurring to the production of effects are altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities may be very naturally explained and have a proper and obvious use assigned them when they are considered only as marks or signs for our information and it is the searching after and endeavouring to understand those signs instituted by the author of nature that ought to be the employment of the natural philosopher and not the pretending to explain things by corporeal causes which doctrine seems to have too much estranged the minds of men from that active principle that supreme and wise spirit in whom we live move and have our being in the twelfth place it may perhaps be objected that though it be clear from what has been said that there can be no such thing as an inert senseless extended solid figured moveable substance existing without the mind such as philosophers describe matter yet if any man shall leave out of his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension figure solidity and motion and say that he means only by that word an inert senseless substance that exists without the mind or unperceived which is the occasion of our ideas or at the presence whereof god is pleased to excite ideas in us it doth not appear but that matter taken in this sense may possibly exist in answer to which i say first that it seems no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents than it is to suppose accidents without a substance but secondly though we should grant this unknown substance may possibly exist yet where can it be supposed to be that it exists not in the mind is agreed and that it exists not in place is no less certain since all extension exists only in the mind as hath been already proved it remains therefore that it exists no where at all let us examine a little the description that is here given us of matter it neither acts nor perceives nor is perceived for this is all that is meant by saying it is an inert senseless unknown substance which is a definition intirely made up of negatives excepting only the relative notion of its standing under or supporting but then it must be observed that it supports nothing at all and how nearly this comes to the description of a nonentity i desire may be considered but say you it is the unknown occasion at the presence of which ideas are excited in us by the will of god now i would fain know how any thing can be present to us which is neither perceivable by sense nor reflexion nor capable of producing any idea in our minds nor is at all extended nor hath any form nor exists in any place the words to be present when thus applied must needs be taken in some abstract and strange meaning and which i am not able to comprehend again let us examine what is meant by occasion so far as i can gather from the common use of language that word signifies either the agent which produces any effect or else something that is observed to accompany or go before it in the ordinary course of things but when it is applied to matter as above described it can be taken in neither of those senses for matter is said to be passive and inert and so cannot be an agent or efficient cause it is also unperceivable as being devoid of all sensible qualities and so cannot be the occasion of our perceptions in the latter sense as when the burning my finger is said to be the occasion of the pain that attends it what therefore can be meant by calling matter an occasion this term is either used in no sense at all or else in some sense very distant from its received signification you will perhaps say that matter though it be not perceived by us is nevertheless perceived by god to whom it is the occasion of exciting ideas in our minds for say you since we observe our sensations to be imprinted in an orderly and constant manner it is but reasonable to suppose there are certain constant and regular occasions of their being produced that is to say that there are certain permanent and distinct parcels of matter corresponding to our ideas which though they do not excite them in our minds or any ways immediately affect us as being altogether passive and unperceivable to us they are nevertheless to god by whom they are perceived as it were so many occasions to remind him when and what ideas to imprint on our minds that so things may go on in a constant uniform manner in answer to this i observe that as the notion of matter is here stated the question is no longer concerning the existence of a thing distinct from spirit and idea from perceiving and being perceived but whether there are not certain ideas of i know not what sort in the mind of god which are so many marks or notes that direct him how to produce sensations in our minds in a constant and regular method much after the same manner as a musician is directed by the notes of musick to produce that harmonious train and composition of sound which is called a tune though they who hear the musick do not perceive the notes and may be intirely ignorant of them but this notion of matter seems too extravagant to deserve a confutation besides it is in effect no objection against what we have advanced to wit that there is no senseless unperceived substance if we follow the light of reason we shall from the constant uniform method of our sensations collect the goodness and wisdom of the spirit who excites them in our minds but this is all that i can see reasonably concluded from thence to me i say it is evident that the being of a spirit infinitely wise good and powerful is abundantly sufficient to explain all the appearances of nature but as for inert senseless matter nothing that i perceive has any the least connexion with it or leads to the thoughts of it and i would fain see any one explain any the meanest phænomenon in nature by it or shew any manner of reason though in the lowest rank of probability that he can have for its existence or even make any tolerable sense or meaning of that supposition for as to its being an occasion we have i think evidently shewn that with regard to us it is no occasion it remains therefore that it must be if at all the occasion to god of exciting ideas in us and what this amounts to we have just now seen it is worth while to reflect a little on the motives which induced men to suppose the existence of material substance that so having observed the gradual ceasing and expiration of those motives or reasons we may proportionably withdraw the assent that was grounded on them first therefore it was thought that colour figure motion and the rest of the sensible qualities or accidents did really exist without the mind and for this reason it seemed needful to suppose some unthinking substratum or substance wherein they did exist since they could not be conceived to exist by themselves afterwards in process of time men being convinced that colours sounds and the rest of the sensible secondary qualities had no existence without the mind they stripped this substratum or material substance of those qualities leaving only the primary ones figure motion and such like which they still conceived to exist without the mind and consequently to stand in need of a material support but it having been shewn that none even of these can possibly exist otherwise than in a spirit or mind which perceives them it follows that we have no longer any reason to suppose the being of matter nay that it is utterly impossible there should be any such thing so long as that word is taken to denote an unthinking substratum of qualities or accidents wherein they exist without the mind but though it be allowed by the materialists themselves that matter was thought of only for the sake of supporting accidents and the reason intirely ceasing one might expect the mind should naturally and without any reluctance at all quit the belief of what was solely grounded thereon yet the prejudice is riveted so deeply in our thoughts that we can scarce tell how to part with it and are therefore inclined since the thing it self is indefensible at least to retain the name which we apply to i know not what abstracted and indefinite notions of being or occasion though without any shew of reason at least so far as i can see for what is there on our part or what do we perceive amongst all the ideas sensations notions which are imprinted on our minds either by sense or reflexion from whence may be inferred the existence of an inert thoughtless unperceived occasion and on the other hand on the part of an allsufficient spirit what can there be that should make us believe or even suspect he is directed by an inert occasion to excite ideas in our minds it is a very extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice and much to be lamented that the mind of man retains so great a fondness against all the evidence of reason for a stupid thoughtless somewhat by the interposition whereof it would as it were skreen it self from the providence of god and remove him farther off from the affairs of the world but though we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of matter though when reason forsakes us we endeavour to support our opinion on the bare possibility of the thing and though we indulge our selves in the full scope of an imagination not regulated by reason to make out that poor possibility yet the upshot of all is that there are certain unknown ideas in the mind of god for this if any thing is all that i conceive to be meant by occasion with regard to god and this at the bottom is no longer contending for the thing but for the name whether therefore there are such ideas in the mind of god and whether they may be called by the name matter i shall not dispute but if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of extension motion and other sensible qualities then to me it is most evidently impossible there should be any such thing since it is a plain repugnancy that those qualities should exist in or be supported by an unperceiving substance but say you though it be granted that there is no thoughtless support of extension and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive yet there may perhaps be some inert unperceiving substance or substratum of some other qualities as incomprehensible to us as colours are to a man born blind because we have not a sense adapted to them but if we had a new sense we should possibly no more doubt of their existence than a blindman made to see does of the existence of light and colours i answer first if what you mean by the word matter be only the unknown support of unknown qualities it is no matter whether there is such a thing or no since it no way concerns us and i do not see the advantage there is in disputing about what we know not what and we know not why but secondly if we had a new sense it could only furnish us with new ideas or sensations and then we should have the same reason against their existing in an unperceiving substance that has been already offered with relation to figure motion colour and the like qualities as hath been shewn are nothing else but sensations or ideas which exist only in a mind perceiving them and this is true not only of the ideas we are acquainted with at present but likewise of all possible ideas whatsoever but you will insist what if i have no reason to believe the existence of matter what if i cannot assign any use to it or explain any thing by it or even conceive what is meant by that word yet still it is no contradiction to say that matter exists and that this matter is in general a substance or occasion of ideas though indeed to go about to unfold the meaning or adhere to any particular explication of those words may be attended with great difficulties i answer when words are used without a meaning you may put them together as you please without danger of running into a contradiction you may say for example that twice two is equal to seven so long as you declare you do not take the words of that proposition in their usual acceptation but for marks of you know not what and by the same reason you may say there is an inert thoughtless substance without accidents which is the occasion of our ideas and we shall understand just as much by one proposition as the other in the last place you will say what if we give up the cause of material substance and assert that matter is an unknown somewhat neither substance nor accident spirit nor idea inert thoughtless indivisible immoveable unextended existing in no place for say you whatever may be urged against substance or occasion or any other positive or relative notion of matter hath no place at all so long as this negative definition of matter is adhered to i answer you may if so it shall seem good use the word matter in the same sense that other men use nothing and so make those terms convertible in your style for after all this is what appears to me to be the result of that definition the parts whereof when i consider with attention either collectively or separate from each other i do not find that there is any kind of effect or impression made on my mind different from what is excited by the term nothing you will reply perhaps that in the foresaid definition is included what doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing the positive abstract idea of quiddity entity or existence i own indeed that those who pretend to the faculty of framing abstract general ideas do talk as if they had such an idea which is say they the most abstract and general notion of all that is to me the most incomprehensible of all others that there are a great variety of spirits of different orders and capacities whose faculties both in number and extent are far exceeding those the author of my being has bestowed on me i see no reason to deny and for me to pretend to determine by my own few stinted narrow inlets of perception what ideas the inexhaustible power of the supreme spirit may imprint upon them were certainly the utmost folly and presumption since there may be for ought that i know innumerable sorts of ideas or sensations as different from one another and from all that i have perceived as colours are from sounds but how ready soever i may be to acknowledge the scantiness of my comprehension with regard to the endless variety of spirits and ideas that might possibly exist yet for any one to pretend to a notion of entity or existence abstracted from spirit and idea from perceived and being perceived is i suspect a downright repugnancy and trifling with words it remains that we consider the objections which may possibly be made on the part of religion some there are who think that though the arguments for the real existence of bodies which are drawn from reason be allowed not to amount to demonstration yet the holy scriptures are so clear in the point as will sufficiently convince every good christian that bodies do really exist and are something more than mere ideas there being in holy writ innumerable facts related which evidently suppose the reality of timber and stone mountains and rivers and cities and humane bodies to which i answer that no sort of writings whatever sacred or profane which use those and the like words in the vulgar acceptation or so as to have a meaning in them are in danger of having their truth called in question by our doctrine that all those things do really exist that there are bodies even corporeal substances when taken in the vulgar sense has been shewn to be agreeable to our principles and the difference betwixt things and ideas realities and chimeras has been distinctly explained and i do not think that either what philosophers call matter or the existence of objects without the mind is any where mentioned in scripture again whether there be or be not external things it is agreed on all hands that the proper use of words is the marking our conceptions or things only as they are known and perceived by us whence it plainly follows that in the tenets we have laid down there is nothing inconsistent with the right use and significancy of language and that discourse of what kind soever so far as it is intelligible remains undisturbed but all this seems so manifest from what hath been set forth in the premises that it is needless to insist any farther on it but it will be urged that miracles do at least lose much of their stress and import by our principles what must we think of mosess rod was it not really turned into a serpent or was there only a change of ideas in the minds of the spectators and can it be supposed that our saviour did no more at the marriagefeast in cana than impose on the sight and smell and taste of the guests so as to create in them the appearance or idea only of wine the same may be said of all other miracles which in consequence of the foregoing principles must be looked upon only as so many cheats or illusions of fancy to this i reply that the rod was changed into a real serpent and the water into real wine that this doth not in the least contradict what i have elsewhere said will be evident from sect and but this business of real and imaginary hath been already so plainly and fully explained and so often referred to and the difficulties about it are so easily answered from what hath gone before that it were an affront to the readers understanding to resume the explication of it in this place i shall only observe that if at table all who were present should see and smell and taste and drink wine and find the effects of it with me there could be no doubt of its reality so that at bottom the scruple concerning real miracles hath no place at all on ours but only on the received principles and consequently maketh rather for than against what hath been said having done with the objections which i endeavoured to propose in the clearest light and gave them all the force and weight i could we proceed in the next place to take a view of our tenets in their consequences some of these appear at first sight as that several difficult and obscure questions on which abundance of speculation hath been thrown away are intirely banished from philosophy whether corporeal substance can think whether sect xxix xxx xxxiii xxxvi c matter be infinitely divisible and how it operates on spirit these and like inquiries have given infinite amusement to philosophers in all ages but depending on the existence of matter they have no longer any place on our principles many other advantages there are as well with regard to religion as the sciences which it is easy for any one to deduce from what hath been premised but this will appear more plainly in the sequel from the principles we have laid down it follows humane knowledge may naturally be reduced to two heads that of ideas and that of spirits of each of these i shall treat in order and first as to ideas or unthinking things our knowledge of these hath been very much obscured and confounded and we have been led into very dangerous errors by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of sense the one intelligible or in the mind the other real and without the mind whereby unthinking things are thought to have a natural subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by spirits this which if i mistake not hath been shewn to be a most groundless and absurd notion is the very root of scepticism for so long as men thought that real things subsisted without the mind and that their knowledge was only so far forth real as it was conformable to real things it follows they could not be certain they had any real knowledge at all for how can it be known that the things which are perceived are conformable to those which are not perceived or exist without the mind colour figure motion extension and the like considered only as so many sensations in the mind are perfectly known there being nothing in them which is not perceived but if they are looked on as notes or images referred to things or archetypes existing without the mind then are we involved all in scepticism we see only the appearances and not the real qualities of things what may be the extension figure or motion of any thing really and absolutely or in it self it is impossible for us to know but only the proportion or the relation they bear to our senses things remaining the same our ideas vary and which of them or even whether any of them at all represent the true quality really existing in the thing it is out of our reach to determine so that for ought we know all we see hear and feel may be only phantom and vain chimera and not at all agree with the real things existing in rerum natura all this scepticism follows from our supposing a difference between things and ideas and that the former have a subsistence without the mind or unperceived it were easy to dilate on this subject and shew how the arguments urged by sceptics in all ages depend on the supposition of external objects so long as we attribute a real existence to unthinking things distinct from their being perceived it is not only impossible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real unthinking being but even that it exists hence it is that we see philosophers distrust their senses and doubt of the existence of heaven and earth of every thing they see or feel even of their own bodies and after all their labour and struggle of thought they are forced to own we cannot attain to any selfevident or demonstrative knowledge of the existence of sensible things but all this doubtfulness which so bewilders and confounds the mind and makes philosophy ridiculous in the eyes of the world vanishes if we annex a meaning to our words and do not amuse our selves with the terms absolute external exist and such like signifying we know not what i can as well doubt of my own being as of the being of those things which i actually perceive by sense it being a manifest contradiction that any sensible object should be immediately perceived by sight or touch and at the same time have no existence in nature since the very existence of an unthinking being consists in being perceived nothing seems of more importance towards erecting a firm systeme of sound and real knowledge which may be proof against the assaults of scepticism than to lay the beginning in a distinct explication of what is meant by thing reality existence for in vain shall we dispute concerning the real existence of things or pretend to any knowledge thereof so long as we have not fixed the meaning of those words thing or being is the most general name of all it comprehends under it two kinds intirely distinct and heterogeneous and which have nothing common but the name to wit spirits and ideas the former are active indivisible substances the latter are inert fleeting dependent beings which subsist not by themselves but are supported by or exist in minds or spiritual substances we comprehend our own existence by inward feeling or reflexion and that of other spirits by reason we may be said to have some knowledge or notion of our own minds of spirits and active beings whereof in a strict sense we have not ideas in like manner we know and have a notion of relations between things or ideas which relations are distinct from the ideas or things related inasmuch as the latter may be perceived by us without our perceiving the former to me it seems that ideas spirits and relations are all in their respective kinds the object of humane knowledge and subject of discourse and that the term idea would be improperly extended to signify every thing we know or have any notion of ideas imprinted on the senses are real things or do really exist this we do not deny but we deny they can subsist without the minds which perceive them or that they are resemblances of any archetypes existing without the mind since the very being of a sensation or idea consists in being perceived and an idea can be like nothing but an idea again the things perceived by sense may be termed external with regard to their origin in that they are not generated from within by the mind it self but imprinted by a spirit distinct from that which perceives them sensible objects may likewise be said to be without the mind in another sense namely when they exist in some other mind thus when i shut my eyes the things i saw may still exist but it must be in another mind it were a mistake to think that what is here said derogates in the least from the reality of things it is acknowledged on the received principles that extension motion and in a word all sensible qualities have need of a support as not being able to subsist by themselves but the objects perceived by sense are allowed to be nothing but combinations of those qualities and consequently cannot subsist by themselves thus far it is agreed on all hands so that in denying the things perceived by sense an existence independent of a substance or support wherein they may exist we detract nothing from the received opinion of their reality and are guilty of no innovation in that respect all the difference is that according to us the unthinking beings perceived by sense have no existence distinct from being perceived and cannot therefore exist in any other substance than those unextended indivisible substances or spirits which act and think and perceive them whereas philosophers vulgarly hold that the sensible qualities exist in an inert extended unperceiving substance which they call matter to which they attribute a natural subsistence exterior to all thinking beings or distinct from being perceived by any mind whatsoever even the eternal mind of the creator wherein they suppose only ideas of the corporeal substances created by him if indeed they allow them to be at all created for as we have shewn the doctrine of matter or corporeal substance to have been the main pillar and support of scepticism so likewise upon the same foundation have been raised all the impious schemes of atheism and irreligion nay so great a difficulty hath it been thought to conceive matter produced out of nothing that the most celebrated among the ancient philosophers even of these who maintained the being of a god have thought matter to be uncreated and coeternal with him how great a friend material substance hath been to atheists in all ages were needless to relate all their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence on it that when this cornerstone is once removed the whole fabrick cannot choose but fall to the ground insomuch that it is no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of atheists that impious and profane persons should readily fall in with those systems which favour their inclinations by deriding immaterial substance and supposing the soul to be divisible and subject to corruption as the body which exclude all freedom intelligence and design from the formation of things and instead thereof make a selfexistent stupid unthinking substance the root and origin of all beings that they should hearken to those who deny a providence or inspection of a superior mind over the affairs of the world attributing the whole series of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity arising from the impulse of one body on another all this is very natural and on the other hand when men of better principles observe the enemies of religion lay so great a stress on unthinking matter and all of them use so much industry and artifice to reduce every thing to it methinks they should rejoice to see them deprived of their grand support and driven from that only fortress without which your epicureans hobbists and the like have not even the shadow of a pretence but become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world the existence of matter or bodies unperceived has not only been the main support of atheists and fatalists but on the same principle doth idolatry likewise in all its various forms depend did men but consider that the sun moon and stars and every other object of the senses are only so many sensations in their minds which have no other existence but barely being perceived doubtless they would never fall down and worship their own ideas but rather address their homage to that eternal invisible mind which produces and sustains all things the same absurd principle by mingling it self with the articles of our faith hath occasioned no small difficulties to christians for example about the resurrection how many scruples and objections have been raised by socinians and others but do not the most plausible of them depend on the supposition that a body is denominated the same with regard not to the form or that which is perceived by sense but the material substance which remains the same under several forms take away this material substance about the identity whereof all the dispute is and mean by body what every plain ordinary person means by that word to wit that which is immediately seen and felt which is only a combination of sensible qualities or ideas and then their most unanswerable objections come to nothing matter being once expelled out of nature drags with it so many sceptical and impious notions such an incredible number of disputes and puzling questions which have been thorns in the sides of divines as well as philosophers and made so much fruitless work for mankind that if the arguments we have produced against it are not found equal to demonstration as to me they evidently seem yet i am sure all friends to knowledge peace and religion have reason to wish they were beside the external existence of the objects of perception another great source of errors and difficulties with regard to ideal knowledge is the doctrine of abstract ideas such as it hath been set forth in the introduction the plainest things in the world those we are most intimately acquainted with and perfectly know when they are considered in an abstract way appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible time place and motion taken in particular or concrete are what every body knows but having passed through the hands of a metaphysician they become too abstract and fine to be apprehended by men of ordinary sense bid your servant meet you at such a time in such a place and he shall never stay to deliberate on the meaning of those words in conceiving that particular time and place or the motion by which he is to get thither he finds not the least difficulty but if time be taken exclusive of all those particular actions and ideas that diversify the day merely for the continuation of existence or duration in abstract then it will perhaps gravel even a philosopher to comprehend it whenever i attempt to frame a simple idea of time abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind which flows uniformly and is participated by all beings i am lost and embrangled in inextricable difficulties i have no notion of it at all only i hear others say it is infinitely divisible and speak of it in such a manner as leads me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence since that doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of thinking either that he passes away innumerable ages without a thought or else that he is annihilated every moment of his life both which seem equally absurd time therefore being nothing abstracted from the sucession of ideas in our minds it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each other in that same spirit or mind hence it is a plain consequence that the soul always thinks and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation will i believe find it no easy task so likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities and consider them by themselves we presently lose sight of them and run into great extravagancies all which depend on a twofold abstraction first it is supposed that extension for example may be abstracted from all other sensible qualities and secondly that the entity of extension may be abstracted from its being perceived but whoever shall reflect and take care to understand what he says will if i mistake not acknowledge that all sensible qualities are alike sensations and alike real that where the extension is there is the colour too to wit in his mind and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind and that the objects of sense are nothing but those sensations combined blended or if one may so speak concreted together none of all which can be supposed to exist unperceived what it is for a man to be happy or an object good every one may think he knows but to frame an abstract idea of happiness prescinded from all particular pleasure or of goodness from every thing that is good this is what few can pretend to so likewise a man may be just and virtuous without having precise ideas of justice and virtue the opinion that those and the like words stand for general notions abstracted from all particular persons and actions seems to have rendered morality difficult and the study thereof of less use to mankind and in effect the doctrine of abstraction has not a little contributed towards spoiling the most useful parts of knowledge the two great provinces of speculative science conversant about ideas received from sense and their relations are natural philosophy and mathematics with regard to each of these i shall make some observations and first i shall say somewhat of natural philosophy on this subject it is that the sceptics triumph all that stock of arguments they produce to depreciate our faculties and make mankind appear ignorant and low are drawn principally from this head to wit that we are under an invincible blindness as to the true and real nature of things this they exaggerate and love to enlarge on we are miserably bantered say they by our senses and amused only with the outside and shew of things the real essence the internal qualities and constitution of every the meanest object is hid from our view something there is in every drop of water every grain of sand which it is beyond the power of humane understanding to fathom or comprehend but it is evident from what has been shewn that all this complaint is groundless and that we are influenced by false principles to that degree as to mistrust our senses and think we know nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend one great inducement to our pronouncing our selves ignorant of the nature of things is the current opinion that every thing includes within it self the cause of its properties or that there is in each object an inward essence which is the source whence its discernible qualities flow and whereon they depend some have pretended to account for appearances by occult qualities but of late they are mostly resolved into mechanical causes to wit the figure motion weight and such like qualities of insensible particles whereas in truth there is no other agent or efficient cause than spirit it being evident that motion as well as all other ideas is perfectly inert see sect hence to endeavour to explain the production of colours or sounds by figure motion magnitude and the like must needs be labour in vain and accordingly we see the attempts of that kind are not at all satisfactory which may be said in general of those instances wherein one idea or quality is assigned for the cause of another i need not say how many hypotheses and speculations are left out and how much the study of nature is abridged by this doctrine the great mechanical principle now in vogue is attraction that a stone falls to the earth or the sea swells towards the moon may to some appear sufficiently explained thereby but how are we enlightened by being told this is done by attraction is it that that word signifies the manner of the tendency and that it is by the mutual drawing of bodies instead of their being impelled or protruded towards each other but nothing is determined of the manner or action and it may as truly for ought we know be termed impulse or protrusion as attraction again the parts of steel we see cohere firmly together and this also is accounted for by attraction but in this as in the other instances i do not perceive that any thing is signified besides the effect it self for as to the manner of the action whereby it is produced or the cause which produces it these are not so much as aimed at indeed if we take a view of the several phænomena and compare them together we may observe some likeness and conformity between them for example in the falling of a stone to the ground in the rising of the sea towards the moon in cohesion and crystallization there is something alike namely an union or mutual approach of bodies so that any one of these or the like phænomena may not seem strange or surprising to a man who hath nicely observed and compared the effects of nature for that only is thought so which is uncommon or a thing by it self and out of the ordinary course of our observation that bodies should tend towards the center of the earth is not thought strange because it is what we perceive every moment of our lives but that they should have a like gravitation towards the center of the moon may seem odd and unaccountable to most men because it is discerned only in the tides but a philosopher whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature having observed a certain similitude of appearances as well in the heavens as the earth that argue innumerable bodies to have a mutual tendency towards each other which he denotes by the general name attraction whatever can be reduced to that he thinks justly accounted for thus he explains the tides by the attraction of the terraqueous globe towards the moon which to him doth not appear odd or anomalous but only a particular example of a general rule or law of nature if therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural philosophers and other men with regard to their knowledge of the phænomena we shall find it consists not in an exacter knowledge of the efficient cause that produces them for that can be no other than the will of a spirit but only in a greater largeness of comprehension whereby analogies harmonies and agreements are discovered in the works of nature and the particular effects explained that is reduced to general rules see sect which rules grounded on the analogy and uniformness observed in the production of natural effects are most agreeable and sought after by the mind for that they extend our prospect beyond what is present and near to us and enable us to make very probable conjectures touching things that may have happened at very great distances of time and place as well as to predict things to come which sort of endeavour towards omniscience is much affected by the mind but we should proceed warily in such things for we are apt to lay too great a stress on analogies and to the prejudice of truth humour that eagerness of the mind whereby it is carried to extend its knowledge into general theoremes for example gravitation or mutual attraction because it appears in many instances some are straightway for pronouncing universal and that to attract and be attracted by every other body is an essential quality inherent in all bodies whatsoever whereas it appears the fixed stars have no such tendency towards each other and so far is that gravitation from being essential to bodies that in some instances a quite contrary principle seems to shew it self as in the perpendicular growth of plants and the elasticity of the air there is nothing necessary or essential in the case but it depends intirely on the will of the governing spirit who causes certain bodies to cleave together or tend towards each other according to various laws whilst he keeps others at a fixed distance and to some he gives a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder just as he sees convenient after what has been premised i think we may lay down the following conclusions first it is plain philosophers amuse themselves in vain when they inquire for any natural efficient cause distinct from a mind or spirit secondly considering the whole creation is the workmanship of a wise and good agent it should seem to become philosophers to employ their thoughts contrary to what some hold about the final causes of things and i must confess i see no reason why pointing out the various ends to which natural things are adapted and for which they were originally with unspeakable wisdom contrived should not be thought one good way of accounting for them and altogether worthy a philosopher thirdly from what hath been premised no reason can be drawn why the history of nature should not still be studied and observations and experiments made which that they are of use to mankind and enable us to draw any general conclusions is not the result of any immutable habitudes or relations between things themselves but only of gods goodness and kindness to men in the administration of the world see sect and fourthly by a diligent observation of the phænomena within our view we may discover the general laws of nature and from them deduce the other phænomena i do not say demonstrate for all deductions of that kind depend on a supposition that the author of nature always operates uniformly and in a constant observance of those rules we take for principles which we cannot evidently know those men who frame general rules from the phænomena and afterwards derive the phænomena from those rules seem to consider signs rather than causes a man may well understand natural signs without knowing their analogy or being able to say by what rule a thing is so or so and as it is very possible to write improperly through too strict an observance of general grammarrules so in arguing from general rules of nature it is not impossible we may extend the analogy too far and by that means run into mistakes as in reading other books a wise man will choose to fix his thoughts on the sense and apply it to use rather than lay them out in grammatical remarks on the language so in perusing the volume of nature it seems beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each particular phænomenon to general rules or shewing how it follows from them we should propose to ourselves nobler views such as to recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty order extent and variety of natural things hence by proper inferences to enlarge our notions of the grandeur wisdom and beneficence of the creator and lastly to make the several parts of the creation so far as in us lies subservient to the ends they were designed for gods glory and the sustentation and comfort of our selves and fellowcreatures the best key for the aforesaid analogy or natural science will be easily acknowledged to be a certain celebrated treatise of mechanics in the entrance of which justly admired treatise time space and motion are distinguished into absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and vulgar which distinction as it is at large explained by the author doth suppose those quantities to have an existence without the mind and that they are ordinarily conceived with relation to sensible things to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no relation at all as for time as it is there taken in an absolute or abstracted sense for the duration or perseverance of the existence of things i have nothing more to add concerning it after what hath been already said on that subject sect and for the rest this celebrated author holds there is an absolute space which being unperceivable to sense remains in it self similar and immoveable and relative space to be the measure thereof which being moveable and defined by its situation in respect of sensible bodies is vulgarly taken for immoveable space place he defines to be that part of space which is occupied by any body and according as the space is absolute or relative so also is the place absolute motion is said to be the translation of a body from absolute place to absolute place as relative motion is from one relative place to another and because the parts of absolute space do not fall under our senses instead of them we are obliged to use their sensible measures and so define both place and motion with respect to bodies which we regard as immoveable but it is said in philosophical matters we must abstract from our senses since it may be that none of those bodies which seem to be quiescent are truly so and the same thing which is moved relatively may be really at rest as likewise one and the same body may be in relative rest and motion or even moved with contrary relative motions at the same time according as its place is variously defined all which ambiguity is to be found in the apparent motions but not at all in the true or absolute which should therefore be alone regarded in philosophy and the true we are told are distinguished from apparent or relative motions by the following properties first in true or absolute motion all parts which preserve the same position with respect to the whole partake of the motions of the whole secondly the place being moved that which is placed therein is also moved so that a body moving in a place which is in motion doth participate the motion of its place thirdly true motion is never generated or changed otherwise than by force impressed on the body it self fourthly true motion is always changed by force impressed on the body moved fifthly in circular motion barely relative there is no centrifugal force which nevertheless in that which is true or absolute is proportional to the quantity of motion but notwithstanding what hath been said it doth not appear to me that there can be any motion other than relative so that to conceive motion there must be at least conceived two bodies whereof the distance or position in regard to each other is varied hence if there was one only body in being it could not possibly be moved this seems evident in that the idea i have of motion doth necessarily include relation but though in every motion it be necessary to conceive more bodies than one yet it may be that one only is moved namely that on which the force causing the change of distance is impressed or in other words that to which the action is applied for however some may define relative motion so as to term that body moved which changes its distance from some other body whether the force or action causing that change were applied to it or no yet as relative motion is that which is perceived by sense and regarded in the ordinary affairs of life it should seem that every man of common sense knows what it is as well as the best philosopher now i ask any one whether in his sense of motion as he walks along the streets the stones he passes over may be said to move because they change distance with his feet to me it seems that though motion includes a relation of one thing to another yet it is not necessary that each term of the relation be denominated from it as a man may think of somewhat which doth not think so a body may be moved to or from another body which is not therefore it self in motion as the place happens to be variously defined the motion which is related to it varies a man in a ship may be said to be quiescent with relation to the sides of the vessel and yet move with relation to the land or he may move eastward in respect of the one and westward in respect of the other in the common affairs of life men never go beyond the earth to define the place of any body and what is quiescent in respect of that is accounted absolutely to be so but philosophers who have a greater extent of thought and juster notions of the system of things discover even the earth it self to be moved in order therefore to fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite and the utmost unmoved walls or shell thereof to be the place whereby they estimate true motions if we sound our own conceptions i believe we may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom no other than relative motion thus defined for as hath been already observed absolute motion exclusive of all external relation is incomprehensible and to this kind of relative motion all the abovementioned properties causes and effects ascribed to absolute motion will if i mistake not be found to agree as to what is said of the centrifugal force that it doth not at all belong to circular relative motion i do not see how this follows from the experiment which is brought to prove it see philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica in schol def for the water in the vessel at that time wherein it is said to have the greatest relative circular motion hath i think no motion at all as is plain from the foregoing section for to denominate a body moved it is requisite first that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other body and secondly that the force or action occasioning that change be applied to it if either of these be wanting i do not think that agreeably to the sense of mankind or the propriety of language a body can be said to be in motion i grant indeed that it is possible for us to think a body which we see change its distance from some other to be moved though it have no force applied to it in which sense there may be apparent motion but then it is because the force causing the change of distance is imagined by us to be applied or impressed on that body thought to move which indeed shews we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in motion which is not and that is all from what hath been said it follows that the philosophic consideration of motion doth not imply the being of an absolute space distinct from that which is perceived by sense and related to bodies which that it cannot exist without the mind is clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like of all other objects of sense and perhaps if we inquire narrowly we shall find we cannot even frame an idea of pure space exclusive of all body this i must confess seems impossible as being a most abstract idea when i excite a motion in some part of my body if it be free or without resistance i say there is space but if i find a resistance then i say there is body and in proportion as the resistance to motion is lesser or greater i say the space is more or less pure so that when i speak of pure or empty space it is not to be supposed that the word space stands for an idea distinct from or conceivable without body and motion though indeed we are apt to think every noun substantive stands for a distinct idea that may be separated from all others which hath occasioned infinite mistakes when therefore supposing all the world to be annihilated besides my own body i say there still remains pure space thereby nothing else is meant but only that i conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all sides without the least resistance but if that too were annihilated then there could be no motion and consequently no space some perhaps may think the sense of seeing doth furnish them with the idea of pure space but it is plain from what we have elsewhere shewn that the ideas of space and distance are not obtained by that sense see the essay concerning vision what is here laid down seems to put an end to all those disputes and difficulties which have sprung up amongst the learned concerning the nature of pure space but the chief advantage arising from it is that we are freed from that dangerous dilemma to which several who have employed their thoughts on this subject imagine themselves reduced to wit of thinking either that real space is god or else that there is something beside god which is eternal uncreated infinite indivisible immutable both which may justly be thought pernicious and absurd notions it is certain that not a few divines as well as philosophers of great note have from the difficulty they found in conceiving either limits or annihilation of space concluded it must be divine and some of late have set themselves particularly to shew that the incommunicable attributes of god agree to it which doctrine how unworthy soever it may seem of the divine nature yet i do not see how we can get clear of it so long as we adhere to the received opinions hitherto of natural philosophy we come now to make some inquiry concerning that other great branch of speculative knowledge to wit mathematics these how celebrated soever they may be for their clearness and certainty of demonstration which is hardly any where else to be found cannot nevertheless be supposed altogether free from mistakes if in their principles there lurks some secret error which is common to the professors of those sciences with the rest of mankind mathematicians though they deduce their theoremes from a great height of evidence yet their first principles are limited by the consideration of quantity and they do not ascend into any inquiry concerning those transcendental maxims which influence all the particular sciences each part whereof mathematics not excepted doth consequently participate of the errors involved in them that the principles laid down by mathematicians are true and their way of deduction from those principles clear and incontestible we do not deny but we hold there may be certain erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of mathematics and for that reason not expresly mentioned though tacitly supposed throughout the whole progress of that science and that the ill effects of those secret unexamined errors are diffused through all the branches thereof to be plain we suspect the mathematicians are as well as other men concerned in the errors arising from the doctrine of abstract general ideas and the existence of objects without the mind arithmetic hath been thought to have for its object abstract ideas of number of which to understand the properties and mutual habitudes is supposed no mean part of speculative knowledge the opinion of the pure and intellectual nature of numbers in abstract hath made them in esteem with those philosophers who seem to have affected an uncommon fineness and elevation of thought it hath set a price on the most trifling numerical speculations which in practice are of no use but serve only for amusement and hath therefore so far infected the minds of some that they have dreamed of mighty mysteries involved in numbers and attempted the explication of natural things by them but if we inquire into our own thoughts and consider what hath been premised we may perhaps entertain a low opinion of those high flights and abstractions and look on all inquiries about numbers only as so many difficiles nugæ so far as they are not subservient to practice and promote the benefit of life unity in abstract we have before considered in sect from which and what hath been said in the introduction it plainly follows there is not any such idea but number being defined a collection of unites we may conclude that if there be no such thing as unity or unite in abstract there are no ideas of number in abstract denoted by the numeral names and figures the theories therefore in arithmetic if they are abstracted from the names and figures as likewise from all use and practice as well as from the particular things numbered can be supposed to have nothing at all for their object hence we may see how intirely the science of numbers is subordinate to practice and how jejune and trifling it becomes when considered as a matter of mere speculation however since there may be some who deluded by the specious shew of discovering abstracted verities waste their time in arithmetical theoremes and problemes which have not any use it will not be amiss if we more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretence and this will plainly appear by taking a view of arithmetic in its infancy and observing what it was that originally put men on the study of that science and to what scope they directed it it is natural to think that at first men for ease of memory and help of computation made use of counters or in writing of single strokes points or the like each whereof was made to signify an unite that is some one thing of whatever kind they had occasion to reckon afterwards they found out the more compendious ways of making one character stand in place of several strokes or points and lastly the notation of the arabians or indians came into use wherein by the repetition of a few characters or figures and varying the signification of each figure according to the place it obtains all numbers may be most aptly expressed which seems to have been done in imitation of language so that an exact analogy is observed betwixt the notation by figures and names the nine simple figures answering the nine first numeral names and places in the former corresponding to denominations in the latter and agreeably to those conditions of the simple and local value of figures were contrived methods of finding from the given figures or marks of the parts what figures and how placed are proper to denote the whole or vice versa and having found the sought figures the same rule or analogy being observed throughout it is easy to read them into words and so the number becomes perfectly known for then the number of any particular things is said to be known when we know the name or figures with their due arrangement that according to the standing analogy belong to them for these signs being known we can by the operations of arithmetic know the signs of any part of the particular sums signified by them and thus computing in signs because of the connexion established betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of things whereof one is taken for an unite we may be able rightly to sum up divide and proportion the things themselves that we intend to number in arithmetic therefore we regard not the things but the signs which nevertheless are not regarded for their own sake but because they direct us how to act with relation to things and dispose rightly of them now agreeably to what we have before observed of words in general sect introd it happens here likewise that abstract ideas are thought to be signified by numeral names or characters while they do not suggest ideas of particular things to our minds i shall not at present enter into a more particular dissertation on this subject but only observe that it is evident from what hath been said those things which pass for abstract truths and theoremes concerning numbers are in reality conversant about no object distinct from particular numerable things except only names and characters which originally came to be considered on no other account but their being signs or capable to represent aptly whatever particular things men had need to compute whence it follows that to study them for their own sake would be just as wise and to as good purpose as if a man neglecting the true use or original intention and subserviency of language should spend his time in impertinent criticisms upon words or reasonings and controversies purely verbal from numbers we proceed to speak of extension which considered as relative is the object of geometry the infinite divisibility of finite extension though it is not expresly laid down either as an axiome or theoreme in the elements of that science yet is throughout the same every where supposed and thought to have so inseparable and essential a connexion with the principles and demonstrations in geometry that mathematicians never admit it into doubt or make the least question of it and as this notion is the source from whence do spring all those amusing geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the plain common sense of mankind and are admitted with so much reluctance into a mind not yet debauched by learning so it is the principal occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty which renders the study of mathematics so difficult and tedious hence if we can make it appear that no finite extension contains innumerable parts or is infinitely divisible it follows that we shall at once clear the science of geometry from a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever been esteemed a reproach to humane reason and withal make the attainment thereof a business of much less time and pains than it hitherto hath been every particular finite extension which may possibly be the object of our thought is an idea existing only in the mind and consequently each part thereof must be perceived if therefore i cannot perceive innumerable parts in any finite extension that i consider it is certain they are not contained in it but it is evident that i cannot distinguish innumerable parts in any particular line surface or solid which i either perceive by sense or figure to my self in my mind wherefore i conclude they are not contained in it nothing can be plainer to me than that the extensions i have in view are no other than my own ideas and it is no less plain that i cannot resolve any one of my ideas into an infinite number of other ideas that is that they are not infinitely divisible if by finite extension be meant something distinct from a finite idea i declare i do not know what that is and so cannot affirm or deny any thing of it but if the terms extension parts and the like are taken in any sense conceivable that is for ideas then to say a finite quantity or extension consists of parts infinite in number is so manifest a contradiction that every one at first sight acknowledges it to be so and it is impossible it should ever gain the assent of any reasonable creature who is not brought to it by gentle and slow degrees as a converted gentile to the belief of transubstantiation ancient and rooted prejudices do often pass into principles and those propositions which once obtain the force and credit of a principle are not only themselves but likewise whatever is deducible from them thought privileged from all examination and there is no absurdity so gross which by this means the mind of man may not be prepared to swallow he whose understanding is prepossest with the doctrine of abstract general ideas may be persuaded that whatever be thought of the ideas of sense extension in abstract is infinitely divisible and one who thinks the objects of sense exist without the mind will perhaps in virtue thereof be brought to admit that a line but an inch long may contain innumerable parts really existing though too small to be discerned these errors are grafted as well in the minds of geometricians as of other men and have a like influence on their reasonings and it were no difficult thing to shew how the arguments from geometry made use of to support the infinite divisibility of extension are bottomed on them at present we shall only observe in general whence it is that the mathematicians are all so fond and tenacious of this doctrine it hath been observed in another place that the theoremes and demonstrations in geometry are conversant about universal ideas sect introd where it is explained in what sense this ought to be understood to wit that the particular lines and figures included in the diagram are supposed to stand for innumerable others of different sizes or in other words the geometer considers them abstracting from their magnitude which doth not imply that he forms an abstract idea but only that he cares not what the particular magnitude is whether great or small but looks on that as a thing indifferent to the demonstration hence it follows that a line in the scheme but an inch long must be spoken of as though it contained ten thousand parts since it is regarded not in it self but as it is universal and it is universal only in its signification whereby it represents innumerable lines greater than it self in which may be distinguished ten thousand parts or more though there may not be above an inch in it after this manner the properties of the lines signified are by a very usual figure transferred to the sign and thence through mistake thought to appertain to it considered in its own nature because there is no number of parts so great but it is possible there may be a line containing more the inchline is said to contain parts more than any assignable number which is true not of the inch taken absolutely but only for the things signified by it but men not retaining that distinction in their thoughts slide into a belief that the small particular line described on paper contains in it self parts innumerable there is no such thing as the tenthousandth part of an inch but there is of a mile or diameter of the earth which may be signified by that inch when therefore i delineate a triangle on paper and take one side not above an inch for example in length to be the radius this i consider as divided into ten thousand or an hundred thousand parts or more for though the tenthousandth part of that line considered in it self is nothing at all and consequently may be neglected without any error or inconveniency yet these described lines being only marks standing for greater quantities whereof it may be the tenthousandth part is very considerable it follows that to prevent notable errors in practice the radius must be taken of ten thousand parts or more from what hath been said the reason is plain why to the end any theoreme may become universal in its use it is necessary we speak of the lines described on paper as though they contained parts which really they do not in doing of which if we examine the matter throughly we shall perhaps discover that we cannot conceive an inch it self as consisting of or being divisible into a thousand parts but only some other line which is far greater than an inch and represented by it and that when we say a line is infinitely divisible we must mean a line which is infinitely great what we have here observed seems to be the chief cause why to suppose the infinite divisibility of finite extension hath been thought necessary in geometry the several absurdities and contradictions which flowed from this false principle might one would think have been esteemed so many demonstrations against it but by i know not what logic it is held that proofs a posteriori are not to be admitted against propositions relating to infinity as though it were not impossible even for an infinite mind to reconcile contradictions or as if any thing absurd and repugnant could have a necessary connexion with truth or flow from it but whoever considers the weakness of this pretence will think it was contrived on purpose to humour the laziness of the mind which had rather acquiesce in an indolent scepticism than be at the pains to go through with a severe examination of those principles it hath ever embraced for true of late the speculations about infinities have run so high and grown to such strange notions as have occasioned no small scruples and disputes among the geometers of the present age some there are of great note who not content with holding that finite lines may be divided into an infinite number of parts do yet farther maintain that each of those infinitesimals is it self subdivisible into an infinity of other parts or infinitesimals of a second order and so on ad infinitum these i say assert there are infinitesimals of infinitesimals of infinitesimals without ever coming to an end so that according to them an inch doth not barely contain an infinite number of parts but an infinity of an infinity of an infinity ad infinitum of parts others there be who hold all orders of infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all thinking it with good reason absurd to imagine there is any positive quantity or part of extension which though multiplied infinitely can ever equal the smallest given extension and yet on the other hand it seems no less absurd to think the square cube or other power of a positive real root should it self be nothing at all which they who hold infinitesimals of the first order denying all of the subsequent orders are obliged to maintain have we not therefore reason to conclude they are both in the wrong and that there is in effect no such thing as parts infinitely small or an infinite number of parts contained in any finite quantity but you will say that if this doctrine obtains it will follow the very foundations of geometry are destroyed and those great men who have raised that science to so astonishing an height have been all the while building a castle in the air to this it may be replied that whatever is useful in geometry and promotes the benefit of humane life doth still remain firm and unshaken on our principles that science considered as practical will rather receive advantage than any prejudice from what hath been said but to set this in a due light may be the subject of a distinct inquiry for the rest though it should follow that some of the more intricate and subtile parts of speculative mathematics may be pared off without any prejudice to truth yet i do not see what damage will be thence derived to mankind on the contrary it were highly to be wished that men of great abilities and obstinate application would draw off their thoughts from those amusements and employ them in the study of such things as lie nearer the concerns of life or have a more direct influence on the manners if it be said that several theoremes undoubtedly true are discovered by methods in which infinitesimals are made use of which could never have been if their existence included a contradiction in it i answer that upon a thorough examination it will not be found that in any instance it is necessary to make use of or conceive infinitesimal parts of finite lines or even quantities less than the minimum sensible nay it will be evident this is never done it being impossible by what we have premised it is plain that very numerous and important errors have taken their rise from those false principles which were impugned in the foregoing parts of this treatise and the opposites of those erroneous tenets at the same time appear to be most fruitful principles from whence do flow innumerable consequences highly advantageous to true philosophy as well as to religion particularly matter or the absolute existence of corporeal objects hath been shewn to be that wherein the most avowed and pernicious enemies of all knowledge whether humane or divine have ever placed their chief strength and confidence and surely if by distinguishing the real existence of unthinking things from their being perceived and allowing them a subsistence of their own out of the minds of spirits no one thing is explained in nature but on the contrary a great many inexplicable difficulties arise if the supposition of matter is barely precarious as not being grounded on so much as one single reason if its consequences cannot endure the light of examination and free inquiry but skreen themselves under the dark and general pretence of infinites being incomprehensible if withal the removal of this matter be not attended with the least evil consequence if it be not even missed in the world but every thing as well nay much easier conceived without it if lastly both sceptics and atheists are for ever silenced upon supposing only spirits and ideas and this scheme of things is perfectly agreeable both to reason and religion methinks we may expect it should be admitted and firmly embraced though it were proposed only as an hypothesis and the existence of matter had been allowed possible which yet i think we have evidently demonstrated that it is not true it is that in consequence of the foregoing principles several disputes and speculations which are esteemed no mean parts of learning are rejected as useless but how great a prejudice soever against our notions this may give to those who have already been deeply engaged and made large advances in studies of that nature yet by others we hope it will not be thought any just ground of dislike to the principles and tenets herein laid down that they abridge the labour of study and make humane sciences more clear compendious and attainable than they were before having despatched what we intended to say concerning the knowledge of ideas the method we proposed leads us in the next place to treat of spirits with regard to which perhaps humane knowledge is not so deficient as is vulgarly imagined the great reason that is assigned for our being thought ignorant of the nature of spirits is our not having an idea of it but surely it ought not to be looked on as a defect in a humane understanding that it does not perceive the idea of spirit if it is manifestly impossible there should be any such idea and this if i mistake not has been demonstrated in sect to which i shall here add that a spirit has been shewn to be the only substance or support wherein the unthinking beings or ideas can exist but that this substance which supports or perceives ideas should it self be an idea or like an idea is evidently absurd it will perhaps be said that we want a sense as some have imagined proper to know substances withal which if we had we might know our own soul as we do a triangle to this i answer that in case we had a new sense bestowed upon us we could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense but i believe no body will say that what he means by the terms soul and substance is only some particular sort of idea or sensation we may therefore infer that all things duly considered it is not more reasonable to think our faculties defective in that they do not furnish us with an idea of spirit or active thinking substance than it would be if we should blame them for not being able to comprehend a round square from the opinion that spirits are to be known after the manner of an idea or sensation have risen many absurd and heterodox tenets and much scepticism about the nature of the soul it is even probable that this opinion may have produced a doubt in some whether they had any soul at all distinct from their body since upon inquiry they could not find they had an idea of it that an idea which is inactive and the existence whereof consists in being perceived should be the image or likeness of an agent subsisting by it self seems to need no other refutation than barely attending to what is meant by those words but perhaps you will say that tho an idea cannot resemble a spirit in its thinking acting or subsisting by it self yet it may in some other respects and it is not necessary that an idea or image be in all respects like the original i answer if it does not in those mentioned it is impossible it should represent it in any other thing do but leave out the power of willing thinking and perceiving ideas and there remains nothing else wherein the idea can be like a spirit for by the word spirit we mean only that which thinks wills and perceives this and this alone constitutes the signification of that term if therefore it is impossible that any degree of those powers should be represented in an idea it is evident there can be no idea of a spirit but it will be objected that if there is no idea signified by the terms soul spirit and substance they are wholly insignificant or have no meaning in them i answer those words do mean or signify a real thing which is neither an idea nor like an idea but that which perceives ideas and wills and reasons about them what i am my self that which i denote by the term i is the same with what is meant by soul or spiritual substance if it be said that this is only quarrelling at a word and that since the immediate significations of other names are by common consent called ideas no reason can be assigned why that which is signified by the name spirit or soul may not partake in the same appellation i answer all the unthinking objects of the mind agree in that they are intirely passive and their existence consists only in being perceived whereas a soul or spirit is an active being whose existence consists not in being perceived but in perceiving ideas and thinking it is therefore necessary in order to prevent equivocation and confounding natures perfectly disagreeing and unlike that we distinguish between spirit and idea see sect in a large sense indeed we may be said to have an idea or rather a notion of spirit that is we understand the meaning of the word otherwise we could not affirm or deny any thing of it moreover as we conceive the ideas that are in the minds of other spirits by means of our own which we suppose to be resemblances of them so we know other spirits by means of our own soul which in that sense is the image or idea of them it having a like respect to other spirits that blueness or heat by me perceived has to those ideas perceived by another it must not be supposed that they who assert the natural immortality of the soul are of opinion that it is absolutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinite power of the creator who first gave it being but only that it is not liable to be broken or dissolved by the ordinary laws of nature or motion they indeed who hold the soul of man to be only a thin vital flame or system of animal spirits make it perishing and corruptible as the body since there is nothing more easily dissipated than such a being which it is naturally impossible should survive the ruin of the tabernacle wherein it is inclosed and this notion hath been greedily embraced and cherished by the worst part of mankind as the most effectual antidote against all impressions of virtue and religion but it hath been made evident that bodies of what frame or texture soever are barely passive ideas in the mind which is more distant and heterogeneous from them than light is from darkness we have shewn that the soul is indivisible incorporeal unextended and it is consequently incorruptible nothing can be plainer than that the motions changes decays and dissolutions which we hourly see befal natural bodies and which is what we mean by the course of nature cannot possibly affect an active simple uncompounded substance such a being therefore is indissoluble by the force of nature that is to say the soul of man is naturally immortal after what hath been said it is i suppose plain that our souls are not to be known in the same manner as senseless inactive objects or by way of idea spirits and ideas are things so wholly different that when we say they exist they are known or the like these words must not be thought to signify any thing common to both natures there is nothing alike or common in them and to expect that by any multiplication or enlargement of our faculties we may be enabled to know a spirit as we do a triangle seems as absurd as if we should hope to see a sound this is inculcated because i imagine it may be of moment towards clearing several important questions and preventing some very dangerous errors concerning the nature of the soul we may not i think strictly be said to have an idea of an active being or of an action although we may be said to have a notion of them i have some knowledge or notion of my mind and its acts about ideas inasmuch as i know or understand what is meant by those words what i know that i have some notion of i will not say that the terms idea and notion may not be used convertibly if the world will have it so but yet it conduceth to clearness and propriety that we distinguish things very different by different names it is also to be remarked that all relations including an act of the mind we cannot so properly be said to have an idea but rather a notion of the relations and habitudes between things but if in the modern way the word idea is extended to spirits and relations and acts this is after all an affair of verbal concern it will not be amiss to add that the doctrine of abstract ideas hath had no small share in rendering those sciences intricate and obscure which are particularly conversant about spiritual things men have imagined they could frame abstract notions of the powers and acts of the mind and consider them prescinded as well from the mind or spirit it self as from their respective objects and effects hence a great number of dark and ambiguous terms presumed to stand for abstract notions have been introduced into metaphysics and morality and from these have grown infinite distractions and disputes amongst the learned but nothing seems more to have contributed towards engaging men in controversies and mistakes with regard to the nature and operations of the mind than the being used to speak of those things in terms borrowed from sensible ideas for example the will is termed the motion of the soul this infuses a belief that the mind of man is as a ball in motion impelled and determined by the objects of sense as necessarily as that is by the stroke of a racket hence arise endless scruples and errors of dangerous consequence in morality all which i doubt not may be cleared and truth appear plain uniform and consistent could but philosophers be prevailed on to retire into themselves and attentively consider their own meaning from what hath been said it is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations or the ideas by them excited in us i perceive several motions changes and combinations of ideas that inform me there are certain particular agents like my self which accompany them and concur in their production hence the knowledge i have of other spirits is not immediate as is the knowledge of my ideas but depending on the intervention of ideas by me referred to agents or spirits distinct from my self as effects or concomitant signs but though there be some things which convince us humane agents are concerned in producing them yet it is evident to every one that those things which are called the works of nature that is the far greater part of the ideas or sensations perceived by us are not produced by or dependent on the wills of men there is therefore some other spirit that causes them since it is repugnant that they should subsist by themselves see sect but if we attentively consider the constant regularity order and concatenation of natural things the surprising magnificence beauty and perfection of the larger and the exquisite contrivance of the smaller parts of creation together with the exact harmony and correspondence of the whole but above all the never enough admired laws of pain and pleasure and the instincts or natural inclinations appetites and passions of animals i say if we consider all these things and at the same time attend to the meaning and import of the attributes one eternal infinitely wise good and perfect we shall clearly perceive that they belong to the aforesaid spirit who works all in all and by whom all things consist hence it is evident that god is known as certainly and immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever distinct from our selves we may even assert that the existence of god is far more evidently perceived than the existence of men because the effects of nature are infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribed to humane agents there is not any one mark that denotes a man or effect produced by him which doth not more strongly evince the being of that spirit who is the author of nature for it is evident that in affecting other persons the will of man hath no other object than barely the motion of the limbs of his body but that such a motion should be attended by or excite any idea in the mind of another depends wholly on the will of the creator he alone it is who upholding all things by the word of his power maintains that intercourse between spirits whereby they are able to perceive the existence of each other and yet this pure and clear light which enlightens every one is it self invisible it seems to be a general pretence of the unthinking herd that they cannot see god could we but see him say they as we see a man we should believe that he is and believing obey his commands but alas we need only open our eyes to see the sovereign lord of all things with a more full and clear view than we do any one of our fellowcreatures not that i imagine we see god as some will have it by a direct and immediate view or see corporeal things not by themselves but by seeing that which represents them in the essence of god which doctrine is i must confess to me incomprehensible but i shall explain my meaning a humane spirit or person is not perceived by sense as not being an idea when therefore we see the colour size figure and motions of a man we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excited in our own minds and these being exhibited to our view in sundry distinct collections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and created spirits like our selves hence it is plain we do not see a man if by man is meant that which lives moves perceives and thinks as we do but only such a certain collection of ideas as directs us to think there is a distinct principle of thought and motion like to our selves accompanying and represented by it and after the same manner we see god all the difference is that whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denotes a particular humane mind whithersoever we direct our view we do at all times and in all places perceive manifest tokens of the divinity every thing we see hear feel or any wise perceive by sense being a sign or effect of the power of god as is our perception of those very motions which are produced by men it is therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that is capable of the least reflexion than the existence of god or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and intire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our being that the discovery of this great truth which lies so near and obvious to the mind should be attained to by the reason of so very few is a sad instance of the stupidity and inattention of men who though they are surrounded with such clear manifestations of the deity are yet so little affected by them that they seem as it were blinded with excess of light but you will say hath nature no share in the production of natural things and must they be all ascribed to the immediate and sole operation of god i answer if by nature is meant only the visible series of effects or sensations imprinted on our minds according to certain fixed and general laws then it is plain that nature taken in this sense cannot produce any thing at all but if by nature is meant some being distinct from god as well as from the laws of nature and things perceived by sense i must confess that word is to me an empty sound without any intelligible meaning annexed to it nature in this acceptation is a vain chimera introduced by those heathens who had not just notions of the omnipresence and infinite perfection of god but it is more unaccountable that it should be received among christians professing belief in the holy scriptures which constantly ascribe those effects to the immediate hand of god that heathen philosophers are wont to impute to nature the lord he causeth the vapours to ascend he maketh lightnings with rain he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures jerem chap ver he turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night amos chap ver he visiteth the earth and maketh it soft with showers he blesseth the springing thereof and crowneth the year with his goodness so that the pastures are clothed with flocks and the valleys are covered over with corn see psalm but notwithstanding that this is the constant language of scripture yet we have i know not what aversion from believing that god concerns himself so nearly in our affairs fain would we suppose him at a great distance off and substitute some blind unthinking deputy in his stead though if we may believe saint paul he be not far from every one of us it will i doubt not be objected that the slow and gradual methods observed in the production of natural things do not seem to have for their cause the immediate hand of an almighty agent besides monsters untimely births fruits blasted in the blossom rains falling in desert places miseries incident to humane life are so many arguments that the whole frame of nature is not immediately actuated and superintended by a spirit of infinite wisdom and goodness but the answer to this objection is in a good measure plain from sect it being visible that the aforesaid methods of nature are absolutely necessary in order to working by the most simple and general rules and after a steady and consistent manner which argues both the wisdom and goodness of god such is the artificial contrivance of this mighty machine of nature that whilst its motions and various phænomena strike on our senses the hand which actuates the whole is it self unperceivable to men of flesh and blood verily saith the prophet thou art a god that hidest thy self isaiah chap ver but though god conceal himself from the eyes of the sensual and lazy who will not be at the least expense of thought yet to an unbiassed and attentive mind nothing can be more plainly legible than the intimate presence of an allwise spirit who fashions regulates and sustains the whole systeme of being it is clear from what we have elsewhere observed that the operating according to general and stated laws is so necessary for our guidance in the affairs of life and letting us into the secret of nature that without it all reach and compass of thought all humane sagacity and design could serve to no manner of purpose it were even impossible there should be any such faculties or powers in the mind see sect which one consideration abundantly outbalances whatever particular inconveniences may thence arise we should further consider that the very blemishes and defects of nature are not without their use in that they make an agreeable sort of variety and augment the beauty of the rest of the creation as shades in a picture serve to set off the brighter and more enlightened parts we would likewise do well to examine whether our taxing the waste of seeds and embryos and accidental destruction of plants and animals before they come to full maturity as an imprudence in the author of nature be not the effect of prejudice contracted by our familiarity with impotent and saving mortals in man indeed a thrifty management of those things which he cannot procure without much pains and industry may be esteemed wisdom but we must not imagine that the inexplicably fine machine of an animal or vegetable costs the great creator any more pains or trouble in its production than a pebble doth nothing being more evident than that an omnipotent spirit can indifferently produce every thing by a mere fiat or act of his will hence it is plain that the splendid profusion of natural things should not be interpreted weakness or prodigality in the agent who produces them but rather be looked on as an argument of the riches of his power as for the mixture of pain or uneasiness which is in the world pursuant to the general laws of nature and the actions of finite imperfect spirits this in the state we are in at present is indispensably necessary to our wellbeing but our prospects are too narrow we take for instance the idea of some one particular pain into our thoughts and account it evil whereas if we enlarge our view so as to comprehend the various ends connexions and dependencies of things on what occasions and in what proportions we are affected with pain and pleasure the nature of humane freedom and the design with which we are put into the world we shall be forced to acknowledge that those particular things which considered in themselves appear to be evil have the nature of good when considered as linked with the whole systeme of beings from what hath been said it will be manifest to any considering person that it is merely for want of attention and comprehensiveness of mind that there are any favourers of atheism or the manichean heresy to be found little and unreflecting souls may indeed burlesque the works of providence the beauty and order whereof they have not capacity or will not be at the pains to comprehend but those who are masters of any justness and extent of thought and are withal used to reflect can never sufficiently admire the divine traces of wisdom and goodness that shine throughout the oeconomy of nature but what truth is there which shineth so strongly on the mind that by an aversion of thought a wilful shutting of the eyes we may not escape seeing it is it therefore to be wondered at if the generality of men who are ever intent on business or pleasure and little used to fix or open the eye of their mind should not have all that conviction and evidence of the being of god which might be expected in reasonable creatures we should rather wonder that men can be found so stupid as to neglect than that neglecting they should be unconvinced of such an evident and momentous truth and yet it is to be feared that too many of parts and leisure who live in christian countries are merely through a supine and dreadful negligence sunk into a sort of atheism since it is downright impossible that a soul pierced and enlightened with a thorough sense of the omnipresence holiness and justice of that almighty spirit should persist in a remorseless violation of his laws we ought therefore earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important points that so we may attain conviction without all scruple that the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good that he is with us and keepeth us in all places whither we go and giveth us bread to eat and raiment to put on that he is present and conscious to our innermost thoughts and that we have a most absolute and immediate dependence on him a clear view of which great truths cannot choose but fill our hearts with an awful circumspection and holy fear which is the strongest incentive to virtue and the best guard against vice for after all what deserves the first place in our studies is the consideration of god and our duty which to promote as it was the main drift and design of my labours so shall i esteem them altogether useless and ineffectual if by what i have said i cannot inspire my readers with a pious sense of the presence of god and having shewn the falseness or vanity of those barren speculations which make the chief employment of learned men the better dispose them to reverence and embrace the salutary truths of the gospel which to know and to practice is the highest perfection of humane nature an essay towards a new theory of vision by george berkeley contents sect design distance of itself invisible remote distance perceived rather by experience than by sense near distance thought to be perceived by the angle of the optic axes difference between this and the former manner of perceiving distance also by diverging rays this depends not on experience these the common accounts but not satisfactory some ideas perceived by the mediation of others no idea which is not itself perceived can be the means of perceiving another distance perceived by means of some other idea those lines and angles mentioned in optics are not themselves perceived hence the mind does not perceive distance by lines and angles also because they have no real existence and because they are insufficient to explain the phenomena the ideas that suggest distance are st the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes betwixt which and distance there is no necessary connection scarce room for mistake in this matter no regard had to the angle of the optic axes judgment of distance made with both eyes the result of experience ndly confusedness of appearance this the occasion of those judgments attributed to diverging rays objection answered what deceives the writers of optics in this matter the cause why one idea may suggest another this applied to confusion and distance thirrdly the straining of the eye the occasions which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it a difficult case proposed by dr barrow as repugnant to all the known theories this case contradicts a received principle in catoptrics it is shown to agree with the principles we have laid down this phenomenon illustrated it confirms the truth of the principle whereby it is explained vision when distinct and when confused the different effects of parallel diverging and converging rays how converging and diverging rays come to suggest the same distance a person extreme purblind would judge aright in the forementioned case lines and angles why useful in optics the not understanding this a cause of mistake a query proposed by mr molyneux in his dioptrics considered one born blind would not at first have any idea of distance by sight this not agreeable to the common principles the proper objects of sight not without the mind nor the images of any thing without the mind this more fully explained in what sense we must be understood to see distance and external things distance and things placed at a distance not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear the ideas of sight more apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch than those of hearing are how this comes to pass strictly speaking we never see and feel the same thing objects of sight twofold mediate and immediate these hard to separate in our thoughts the received accounts of our perceiving magnitude by sight false magnitude perceived as immediately as distance two kinds of sensible extension neither of which is infinitely divisible the tangible magnitude of an object steady the visible not by what means tangible magnitude is perceived by sight this further enlarged on no necessary connection between confusion or faintness of appearance and small or great magnitude the tangible magnitude of an object more heeded than the visible and why an instance of this men do not measure by visible feet or inches no necessary connection between visible and tangible extension greater visible magnitude might signify lesser tangible magnitude the judgments we make of magnitude depend altogether on experience distance and magnitude seen as shame or anger but we are prone to think otherwise and why the moon seems greater in the horizon than in the meridian the cause of this phenomenon assigned the horizontal moon why greater at one time than another the account we have given proved to be true and confirmed by the moons appearing greater in a mist objection answered the way wherein faintness suggests greater magnitude illustrated appearance of the horizontal moon why thought difficult to explain attempts towards the solution of it made by several but in vain the opinion of dr wallis it is shown to be unsatisfactory how lines and angles may be of use in computing apparent magnitudes one born blind being made to see what judgment he would make of magnitude the minimum visible the same to all creatures objection answered the eye at all times perceives the same number of visible points two imperfections in the visive faculty answering to which we may conceive two perfections in neither of these two ways do microscopes improve the sight the case of microscopical eyes considered the sight admirably adapted to the ends of seeing difficulty concerning erect vision the common way of explaining it the same shown to be false not distinguishing between ideas of sight and touch cause of mistake in this matter the case of one born blind proper to be considered such a one might by touch attain to have ideas of upper and lower which modes of situation he would attribute only to things tangible he would not at first sight think anything he saw high or low erect or inverted this illustrated by an example by what means he would come to denominate visible objects high or low etc why he should think those objects highest which are painted on the lowest part of his eye and vice versa how he would perceive by sight the situation of external objects our propension to think the contrary no argument against what has been said objection answer an object could not be known at first sight by the colour nor by the magnitude thereof nor by the figure in the first act of vision no tangible thing would be suggested by sight difficulty proposed concerning number number of things visible would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible number the creature of the mind one born blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do the situation of any object determined with respect only to objects of the same sense no distance great or small between a visible and tangible thing the not observing this cause of difficulty in erect vision which otherwise includes nothing unaccountable what is meant by the picture being inverted cause of mistake in this matter images in the eye not pictures of external objects in what sense they are pictures in this affair we must carefully distinguish between ideas of sight and touch difficult to explain by words the true theory of vision the question whether there is any idea common to sight and touch stated abstract extension inquired into it is incomprehensible abstract extension not the object of geometry the general idea of a triangle considered vacuum or pure space not common to sight and touch there is no idea or kind of idea common to both senses first argument in proof hereof second argument visible figure and extension not distinct ideas from colour third argument confirmation drawn from mr molyneuxs problem of a sphere and a cube published by mr locke which is falsely solved if the common supposition be true more might be said in proof of our tenet but this suffices further reflection on the foregoing problem the same thing doth not affect both sight and touch the same idea of motion not common to sight and touch the way wherein we apprehend motion by sight easily collected from what hath been said qu how visible and tangible ideas came to have the same name if not of the same kind this accounted for without supposing them of the same kind obj that a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle ans that a visible square is fitter than a visible circle to represent a tangible square but it doth not hence follow that a visible square is like a tangible square why we are more apt to confound visible with tangible ideas than other signs with the things signified several other reasons hereof assigned reluctancy in rejecting any opinion no argument of its truth proper objects of vision the language of nature in it there is much admirable and deserving our attention question proposed concerning the object of geometry at first view we are apt to think visible extension the object of geometry visible extension shown not to be the object of geometry words may as well be thought the object of geometry as visible extension it is proposed to inquire what progress an intelligence that could see but not feel might make in geometry he cannot understand those parts which relate to solids and their surfaces and lines generated by their section nor even the elements of plane geometry the proper objects of sight incapable of being managed as geometrical figures the opinion of those who hold plane figures to be the immediate objects of sight considered planes no more the immediate objects of sight than solids difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the abovementioned intelligence the object of geometry its not being sufficiently understood cause of difficulty and useless labour in that science an essay towards a new theory of vision my design is to show the manner wherein we perceive by sight the distance magnitude and situation of objects also to consider the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch and whether there be any idea common to both senses it is i think agreed by all that distance of itself and immediately cannot be seen for distance being a line directed endwise to the eye it projects only one point in the fund of the eye which point remains invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter i find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of objects considerably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded on experience than of sense for example when i perceive a great number of intermediate objects such as houses fields rivers and the like which i have experienced to take up a considerable space i thence form a judgment or conclusion that the object i see beyond them is at a great distance again when an object appears faint and small which at a near distance i have experienced to make a vigorous and large appearance i instantly conclude it to be far off and this it is evident is the result of experience without which from the faintness and littleness i should not have inferred anything concerning the distance of objects but when an object is placed at so near a distance as that the interval between the eyes bears any sensible proportion to it the opinion of speculative men is that the two optic axes the fancy that we see only with one eye at once being exploded concurring at the object do there make an angle by means of which according as it is greater or lesser the object is perceived to be nearer or farther off betwixt which and the foregoing manner of estimating distance there is this remarkable difference that whereas there was no apparent necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance or between great distance and a little and faint appearance there appears a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance and an acute angle and farther distance it does not in the least depend upon experience but may be evidently known by anyone before he had experienced it that the nearer the concurrence of the optic axes the greater the angle and the remoter their concurrence is the lesser will be the angle comprehended by them there is another way mentioned by optic writers whereby they will have us judge of those distances in respect of which the breadth of the pupil hath any sensible bigness and that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which issuing from the visible point do fall on the pupil that point being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging rays and that remoter which is seen by less diverging rays and so on the apparent distance still increasing as the divergency of the rays decreases till at length it becomes infinite when the rays that fall on the pupil are to sense parallel and after this manner it is said we perceive distance when we look only with one eye in this case also it is plain we are not beholding to experience it being a certain necessary truth that the nearer the direct rays falling on the eye approach to a parallelism the farther off is the point of their intersection or the visible point from whence they flow i have here set down the common current accounts that are given of our perceiving near distances by sight which though they are unquestionably received for true by mathematicians and accordingly made use of by them in determining the apparent places of objects do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory and that for these following reasons first it is evident that when the mind perceives any idea not immediately and of itself it must be by the means of some other idea thus for instance the passions which are in the mind of another are of themselves to me invisible i may nevertheless perceive them by sight though not immediately yet by means of the colours they produce in the countenance we often see shame or fear in the looks of a man by perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale moreover it is evident that no idea which is not itself perceived can be the means of perceiving any other idea if i do not perceive the redness or paleness of a mans face themselves it is impossible i should perceive by them the passions which are in his mind now from sect it is plain that distance is in its own nature imperceptible and yet it is perceived by sight it remains therefore that it be brought into view by means of some other idea that is itself immediately perceived in the act of vision but those lines and angles by means whereof some mathematicians pretend to explain the perception of distance are themselves not at all perceived nor are they in truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics i appeal to anyones experience whether upon sight of an object he computes its distance by the bigness of the angle made by the meeting of the two optic axes or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to his pupil everyone is himself the best judge of what he perceives and what not in vain shall all the mathematicians in the world tell me that i perceive certain lines and angles which introduce into my mind the various ideas of distance so long as i myself am conscious of no such thing since therefore those angles and lines are not themselves perceived by sight it follows from sect that the mind doth not by them judge of the distance of objects secondly the truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to anyone that considers those lines and angles have no real existence in nature being only an hypothesis framed by the mathematicians and by them introduced into optics that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way the third and last reason i shall give for rejecting that doctrine is that though we should grant the real existence of those optic angles etc and that it was possible for the mind to perceive them yet these principles would not be found sufficient to explain the phenomena of distance as shall be shown hereafter now it being already shown that distance is suggested to the mind by the mediation of some other idea which is itself perceived in the act of seeing it remains that we inquire what ideas or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we may suppose the ideas of distance are connected and by which they are introduced into the mind and first it is certain by experience that when we look at a near object with both eyes according as it approaches or recedes from us we alter the disposition of our eyes by lessening or widening the interval between the pupils this disposition or turn of the eyes is attended with a sensation which seems to me to be that which in this case brings the idea of greater or lesser distance into the mind not that there is any natural or necessary connection between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes and greater or lesser distance but because the mind has by constant experience found the different sensations corresponding to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended each with a different degree of distance in the object there has grown an habitual or customary connection between those two sorts of ideas so that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceives the different idea of distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation just as upon hearing a certain sound the idea is immediately suggested to the understanding which custom had united with it nor do i see how i can easily be mistaken in this matter i know evidently that distance is not perceived of itself that by consequence it must be perceived by means of some other idea which is immediately perceived and varies with the different degrees of distance i know also that the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes is of itself immediately perceived and various degrees thereof are connected with different distances which never fail to accompany them into my mind when i view an object distinctly with both eyes whose distance is so small that in respect of it the interval between the eyes has any considerable magnitude i know it is a received opinion that by altering the disposition of the eyes the mind perceives whether the angle of the optic axes is made greater or lesser and that accordingly by a kind of natural geometry it judges the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther off but that this is not true i am convinced by my own experience since i am not conscious that i make any such use of the perception i have by the turn of my eyes and for me to make those judgments and draw those conclusions from it without knowing that i do so seems altogether incomprehensible from all which it follows that the judgment we make of the distance of an object viewed with both eyes is entirely the result of experience if we had not constantly found certain sensations arising from the various disposition of the eyes attended with certain degrees of distance we should never make those sudden judgments from them concerning the distance of objects no more than we would pretend to judge a mans thoughts by his pronouncing words we had never heard before secondly an object placed at a certain distance from the eye to which the breadth of the pupil bears a considerable proportion being made to approach is seen more confusedly and the nearer it is brought the more confused appearance it makes and this being found constantly to be so there ariseth in the mind an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and distance the greater confusion still implying the lesser distance and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object this confused appearance of the object doth therefore seem to be the medium whereby the mind judgeth of distance in those cases wherein the most approved writers of optics will have it judge by the different divergency with which the rays flowing from the radiating point fall on the pupil no man i believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angles that the rays are supposed to form according to their various inclinations on his eye but he cannot choose seeing whether the object appear more or less confused it is therefore a manifest consequence from what bath been demonstrated that instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays the mind makes use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appearance thereby to determine the apparent place of an object nor doth it avail to say there is not any necessary connection between confused vision and distance great or small for i ask any man what necessary connection he sees between the redness of a blush and shame and yet no sooner shall he behold that colour to arise in the face of another but it brings into his and the idea of that passion which hath been observed to accompany it what seems to have misled the writers of optics in this matter is that they imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in mathematics betwixt which and the premises it is indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary connection but it is far otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance we are not to think that brutes and children or even grown reasonable men whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration that one idea may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have been observed to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence or without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist of this there are innumerable instances of which no one can be ignorant thus greater confusion having been constantly attended with nearer distance no sooner is the former idea perceived but it suggests the latter to our thoughts and if it had been the ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object were placed the more confused it should appear it is certain the very same perception that now makes us think an object approaches would then have made us to imagine it went farther off that perception abstracting from custom and experience being equally fitted to produce the idea of great distance or small distance or no distance at all thirdly an object being placed at the distance above specified and brought nearer to the eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the appearances growing more confused by straining the eye in which case that sensation supplies the place of confused vision in aiding the mind to judge of the distance of the object it being esteemed so much the nearer by how much the effort or straining of the eye in order to distinct vision is greater i have here set down those sensations or ideas that seem to be the constant and general occasions of introducing into the mind the different ideas of near distance it is true in most cases that divers other circumstances contribute to frame our idea of distance to wit the particular number size kind etc of the things seen concerning which as well as all other the forementioned occasions which suggest distance i shall only observe they have none of them in their own nature any relation or connection with it nor is it possible they should ever signify the various degrees thereof otherwise than as by experience they have been found to be connected with them i shall proceed upon these principles to account for a phenomenon which has hitherto strangely puzzled the writers of optics and is so far from being accounted for by any of their theories of vision that it is by their own confession plainly repugnant to them and of consequence if nothing else could be objected were alone sufficient to bring their credit in question the whole difficulty i shall lay before you in the words of the learned dr barrow with which he concludes his optic lectures i have here delivered what my thoughts have suggested to me concerning that part of optics which is more properly mathematical as for the other parts of that science which being rather physical do consequently abound with plausible conjectures instead of certain principles there has in them scarce anything occurred to my observation different from what has been already said by kepler scheinerus descartes and others and methinks i had better say nothing at all than repeat that which has been so often said by others i think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject but before i quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous dealing that i owe both to you and to truth obligeth me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty which seems directly opposite to the doctrine i have been hitherto inculcating at least admits of no solution from it in short it is this before the double convex glass or concave speculum ebf let the point a be placed at such a distance that the rays proceeding from a after refraction or reflection be brought to unite somewhere in the axab and suppose the point of union ie the image of the point a as hath been already set forth to be z between which and b the vertex of the glass or speculum conceive the eye to be anywhere placed the question now is where the point a ought to appear experience shows that it does not appear behind at the point z and it were contrary to nature that it should since all the impression which affects the sense comes from towards a but from our tenets it should seem to follow that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off so great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance for since if we exclude all anticipations and prejudices every object appears by so much the farther off by how much the rays it sends to the eye are less diverging and that object is thought to be most remote from which parallel rays proceed unto the eye reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a greater distance which is seen by converging rays moreover it may in general be asked concerning this case what it is that determines the apparent place of the point a and maketh it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other times farther off to which doubt i see nothing that can be answered agreeable to the principles we have laid down except only that the point a ought always to appear extremely remote but on the contrary we are assured by experience that the point a appears variously distant according to the different situations of the eye between the points b and z and that it doth never if at all seem farther off than it would if it were beheld by the naked eye but on the contrary it doth sometimes appear much nearer nay it is even certain that by how much the rays falling on the eye do more converge by so much the nearer doth the object seem to approach for the eye being placed close to the point b the object a appears nearly in its own natural place if the point b is taken in the glass or at the same distance if in the speculum the eye being brought back to o the object seems to draw near and being come to p it beholds it still nearer and so on little and little till at length the eye being placed somewhere suppose at q the object appearing extremely near begins to vanish into mere confusion all which doth seem repugnant to our principles at least not rightly to agree with them nor is our tenet alone struck at by this experiment but likewise all others that ever came to my knowledge are every whit as much endangered by it the ancient one especially which is most commonly received and comes nearest to mine seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby that the most learned tacquet has been forced to reject that principle as false and uncertain on which alone he had built almost his whole catoptrics and consequently by taking away the foundation hath himself pulled down the superstructure he had raised on it which nevertheless i do not believe he would have done had he but considered the whole matter more thoroughly and examined the difficulty to the bottom but as for me neither this nor any other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me as to make me renounce that which i know to be manifestly agreeable to reason especially when as it here falls out the difficulty is founded in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular case for in the present case something peculiar lies hid which being involved in the subtilty of nature will perhaps hardly be discovered till such time as the manner of vision is more perfectly made known concerning which i must own i have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least show of probability not to mention certainty i shall therefore leave this knot to be untied by you wishing you may have better success in it than i have had the ancient and received principle which dr barrow here mentions as the main foundation of tacquets catoptrics is that every visible point seen by reflection from a speculum shall appear placed at the intersection of the reflected ray and the perpendicular of incidence which intersection in the present case happening to be behind the eye it greatly shakes the authority of that principle whereon the aforementioned author proceeds throughout his whole catoptrics in determining the apparent place of objects seen by reflection from any kind of speculum let us now see how this phenomenon agrees with our tenets the eye the nearer it is placed to the point b in the foregoing figures the more distinct is the appearance of the object but as it recedes to o the appearance grows more confused and at p it sees the object yet more confused and so on till the eye being brought back to z sees the object in the greatest confusion of all wherefore by sect the object should seem to approach the eye gradually as it recedes from the point b that is at o it should in consequence of the principle i have laid down in the aforesaid section seem nearer than it did at b and at p nearer than at o and at q nearer than at p and so on till it quite vanishes at z which is the very matter of fact as anyone that pleases may easily satisfy himself by experiment this case is much the same as if we should suppose an englishman to meet a foreigner who used the same words with the english but in a direct contrary signification the englishman would not fail to make a wrong judgment of the ideas annexed to those sounds in the mind of him that used them just so in the present case the object speaks if i may so say with words that the eye is well acquainted with that is confusions of appearance but whereas heretofore the greater confusions were always wont to signify nearer distances they have in this case a direct contrary signification being connected with the greater distances whence it follows that the eye must unavoidably be mistaken since it will take the confusions in the sense it has been used to which is directly opposed to the true this phenomenon as it entirely subverts the opinion of those who will have us judge of distance by lines and angles on which supposition it is altogether inexplicable so it seems to me no small confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it is explained but in order co a more full explication of this point and to show how far the hypothesis of the minds judging by the various divergency of rays may be of use in determining the apparent place of an object it will be necessary to premise some few things which are already well known to those who have any skill in dioptrics first any radiating point is then distinctly seen when the rays proceeding from it are by the refractive power of the crystalline accurately reunited in the retina or fund of the eye but if they are reunited either before they arrive at the retina or after they have passed it then there is confused vision secondly suppose in the adjacent figures np represent an eye duly framed and retaining its natural figure in fig the rays falling nearly parallel on the eye are by the crystalline ab refracted so as their focus or point of union f falls exactly on the retina but if the rays fall sensibly diverging on the eye as in fig then their focus falls beyond the retina or if the rays are made to converge by the lens qs before they come at the eye as in fig their focus f will fall before the retina in which two last cases it is evident from the foregoing section that the appearance of the point z is confused and by how much the greater is the convergency or divergency of the rays falling on the pupil by so much the farther will the point of their reunion be from the retina either before or behind it and consequently the point z will appear by so much the more confused and this by the bye may show us the difference between confused and faint vision confused vision is when the rays proceedings from each distinct point of the object are not accurately recollected in one corresponding point on the retina but take up some space thereon so that rays from different points become mixed and confused together this is opposed to a distinct vision and attends near objects faint vision is when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few rays arrive from the object to the eye this is opposed to vigorous or clear vision and attends remote objects but to return the eye or to speak truly the mind perceiving only the confusion itself without ever considering the cause from which it proceeds doth constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion whether that confusion be occasioned by converging or by diverging rays it matters not whence it follows that the eye viewing the object z through the glass qs which by refraction causeth the rays zq zs etc to converge should judge it to be at such a nearness at which if it were placed it would radiate on the eye with rays diverging to that degree as would produce the same confusion which is now produced by converging rays ie would cover a portion of the retina equal to dc vid fig supra but then this must be understood to use dr barrows phrase seclusis praenotionibus et praejudiciis in case we abstract from all other circumstances of vision such as the figure size faintness etc of the visible objects all which do ordinarily concur to form our idea of distance the mind having by frequent experience observed their several sorts or degrees to be connected with various distances it plainly follows from what hath been said that a person perfectly purblind ie that could not see an object distinctly but when placed close to his eye would not make the same wrong judgment that others do in the forementioned case for to him greater confusions constantly suggesting greater distances he must as he recedes from the glass and the object grows more confused judge it to be at a farther distance contrary to what they do who have had the perception of the objects growing more confused connected with the idea of approach hence also it doth appear there may be good use of computation by lines and angles in optics not that the mind judgeth of distance immediately by them but because it judgeth by somewhat which is connected with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient thus the mind judging of the distance of an object by the confusedness of its appearance and this confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked eye according as the object is seen by rays more or less diverging it follows that a man may make use of the divergency of the rays in computing the apparent distance though not for its own sake yet on account of the confusion with which it is connected but so it is the confusion itself is entirely neglected by mathematicians as having no necessary relation with distance such as the greater or lesser angles of divergency are conceived to have and these especially for that they fall under mathematical computation are alone regarded in determining the apparent places of objects as though they were the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind makes of distance whereas in truth they should not at all be regarded in themselves or any otherwise than as they are supposed to be the cause of confused vision the not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing oversight for proof whereof we need go no farther than the case before us it having been observed that the most diverging rays brought into the mind the idea of nearest distance and that still as the divergency decreased the distance increased and it being thought the connexion between the various degrees of divergency and distance was immediate this naturally leads one to conclude from an illgrounded analogy that converging rays shall make an object appear at an immense distance and that as the convergency increases the distance if it were possible should do so likewise that this was the cause of dr barrows mistake is evident from his own words which we have quoted whereas had the learned doctor observed that diverging and converging rays how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in producing the same effect to wit confusedness of vision greater degrees whereof are produced indifferently either as the divergency or convergency and the rays increaseth and that it is by this effect which is the same in both that either the divergency or convergency is perceived by the eye i say had he but considered this it is certain he would have made a quite contrary judgment and rightly concluded that those rays which fall on the eye with greater degrees of convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer but it is plain it was impossible for any man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he had regard only to lines and angles and did not apprehend the true nature of vision and how far it was of mathematical consideration before we dismiss this subject it is fit we take notice of a query relating thereto proposed by the ingenious mr molyneux is his treatise of dioptricspar i prop sect where speaking of this difficulty he has these words and so he ie dr barrow leaves this difficulty to the solution of others which i after so great an example shall do likewise but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doarine which we have before laid down for determining the locus objecti on account of being pressed by one difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by mortals in the meantime i propose it to the consideration of the ingenious whether the locus apparens of an object placed as in this th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base is behind the eye to which query we may venture to answer in the negative for in the present case the rule for determining the distance of the distinct base or respective focus from the glass is this as the difference between the distance of the object and focus is to the focus or focal length so the distance of the object from the glass is to the distance of the respective focus or distinct base from the glass molyneux dioptr par i prop let us now suppose the object to be placed at the distance of the focal length and one half of the focal length from the glass and the eye close to the glass hence it will follow by the rule that the distance of the distinct base behind the eye is double the true distance of the object before the eye if therefore mr molyneuxs conjecture held good it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really is and in other cases at three or four times its due distance or more but this manifestly contradicts experience the object never appearing at farthest beyond its due distance whatever therefore is built on this supposition vid corol i prop ibid comes to the ground along with it from what hath been premised it is a manifest consequence that a man born blind being made to see would at first have no idea of distance by sight the sun and stars the remotest objects as well as the nearer would all seem to be in his eye or rather in his mind the objects intromitted by sight would seem to him as in truth they are no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations each whereof is as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure or the most inward passions of his soul for our judging objects provided by sight to be at any distance or without the mind is vid sect entirely the effect of experience which one in those circumstances could not yet have attained to it is indeed otherwise upon the common supposition that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic axes just as one in the dark or a blindman by the angle comprehended by two sticks one whereof he held in each hand for if this were true it would follow that one blind from his birth being made to see should stand in need of no new experience in order to perceive distance by sight but that this is false has i think been sufficiently demonstrated and perhaps upon a strict inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their birth have grown up in a continued habit of seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side to wit in thinking what they see to be at a distance from them for at this time it seems agreed on all hands by those who have had any thoughts of that matter that colours which are the proper and immediate object of sight are not without the mind but then it will be said by sight we have also the ideas of extension and figure and motion all which may well be thought without and at some distance from the mind though colour should not in answer to this i appeal to any mans experience whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the colour of that object nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place is not the extension we see coloured and is it possible for us so much as in thought to separate and abstract colour from extension now where the extension is there surely is the figure and there the motion too i speak of those which are perceived by sight but for a fuller explication of this point and to show that the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things placed at a distance it is requisite that we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what is meant in common discourse when one says that which he sees is at a distance from him suppose for example that looking at the moon i should say it were fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me let us see what moon this is spoken of it is plain it cannot be the visible moon or anything like the visible moon or that which i see which is only a round luminous plane of about thirty visible points in diameter for in case i am carried from the place where i stand directly towards the moon it is manifest the object varies still as i go on and by the time that i am advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth i shall be so far from being near a small round luminous flat that i shall perceive nothing like it this object having long since disappeared and if i would recover it it must be by going back to the earth from whence i set out again suppose i perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of something which i doubt whether it be a man or a tree or a tower but judge it to be at the distance of about a mile it is plain i cannot mean that what i see is a mile off or that it is the image or likeness of anything which is a mile off since that every step i take towards it the appearance alters and from being obscure small and faint grows clear large and vigorous and when i come to the miles end that which i saw first is quite lost neither do i find anything in the likeness of it in these and the like instances the truth of the matter stands thus having of a long time experienced certain ideas perceivable by touch as distance tangible figure and solidity to have been connected with certain ideas of sight i do upon perceiving these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are by the wonted ordinary course of nature like to follow looking at an object i perceive a certain visible figure and colour with some degree of faintness and other circumstances which from what i have formerly observed determine me to think that if i advance forward so many paces or miles i shall be affected with such and such ideas of touch so that in truth and strictness of speech i neither see distance itself nor anything that i take to be at a distance i say neither distance nor things placed at a distance are themselves or their ideas truly perceived by sight this i am persuaded of as to what concerns myself and i believe whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts and examine what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his understanding that after having passed a certain distance to be measured by the motion of his body which is perceivable by touch he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas but that one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense and that there is no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas suggested by them we need go no farther than the next lookingglass or pictures to be convinced note that when i speak of tangible ideas i take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understanding in which large signification it is commonly used by the moderns from what we have shown it is a manifest consequence that the ideas of space outness and things placed at a distance are not strictly speaking the object of sight they are not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear sitting in my study i hear a coach drive along the street i look through the casement and see it i walk out and enter into it thus common speech would incline one to think i heard saw and touched the same thing to wit the coach it is nevertheless certain the ideas intromitted by each sense are widely different and distinct from each other but having been observed constantly to go together they are spoken of as one and the same thing by the variation of the noise i perceive the different distances of the coach and know that it approaches before i look out thus by the ear i perceive distance just after the same manner as i do by the eye i do not nevertheless say i hear distance in like manner as i say that i see it the ideas perceived by hearing not being so apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch as those of sight are so likewise a man is easily convinced that bodies and external things are not properly the object of hearing but only sounds by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that body or distance is suggested to his thoughts but then one is with more difficulty brought to discern the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch though it be certain a man no more sees and feels the same thing than he hears and feels the same thing one reason of which seems to be this it is thought a great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one extension and one figure but the extension and figure of a body being let into the mind two ways and that indifferently either by sight or touch it seems to follow that we see the same extension and the same figure which we feel but if we take a close and accurate view of things it must be acknowledged that we never see and feel one and the same object that which is seen is one thing and that which is felt is another if the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible figure and extension we are not to infer that one and the same thing has divers extensions the true consequence is that the objects of sight and touch are two distinct things it may perhaps require some thought rightly to conceive this distinction and the difficulty seems not a little increased because the combination of visible ideas hath constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it is connected which doth of necessity arise from the use and end of language in order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision we must bear in mind that there are two sorts of objects apprehended by the eye the one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former those of the first sort neither are nor appear to be without the mind or at any distance off they may indeed grow greater or smaller more confused or more clear or more faint but they do not cannot approach or recede from us whenever we say an object is at a distance whenever we say it draws near or goes farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the touch and are not so truly perceived as suggested by the eye in like manner as thoughts by the ear no sooner do we hear the words of a familiar language pronounced in our ears but the ideas corresponding thereto present themselves to our minds in the very same instant the sound and the meaning enter the understanding so closely are they united that it is not in our power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also we even act in all respects as if we heard the very thoughts themselves so likewise the secondary objects or those which are only suggested by sight do often more strongly affect us and are more regarded than the proper objects of that sense along with which they enter into the mind and with which they have a far more strict connexion than ideas have with words hence it is we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate objects of sight and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter they are as it were most closely twisted blended and incorporated together and the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time by the use of language and want of reflexion however i believe anyone that shall attentively consider what we have already said and shall say upon this subject before we have done especially if he pursue it in his own thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice sure i am it is worth some attention to whoever would understand the true nature of vision i have now done with distance and proceed to show how it is that we perceive by sight the magnitude of objects it is the opinion of some that we do it by angles or by angles in conjunction with distance but neither angles nor distance being perceivable by sight and the things we see being in truth at no distance from us it follows that as we have shown lines and angles not to be the medium the mind makes use of in apprehending the apparent place so neither are they the medium whereby it apprehends the apparent magnitude of objects it is well known that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a greater angle and at a farther distance a lesser angle and by this principle we are told the mind estimates the magnitude of an object comparing the angle under which it is seen with its distance and thence inferring the magnitude thereof what inclines men to this mistake beside the humour of making one see by geometry is that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest magnitude but if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former i say they do not first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance and suggest magnitude as independently of distance as they do distance independently of magnitude all which will be evident to whoever considers what hath been already said and what follows it hath been shown there are two sorts of objects apprehended by sight each whereof hath its distinct magnitude or extension the one properly tangible ie to be perceived and measured by touch and not immediately falling under the sense of seeing the other properly and immediately visible by mediation of which the former is brought in view each of these magnitudes are greater or lesser according as they contain in them more or fewer points they being made up of points or minimums for whatever may be said of extension in abstract it is certain sensible extension is not infinitely divisible there is a minimum tangibile and a minimum visibile beyond which sense cannot perceive this everyones experience will inform him the magnitude of the object which exists without the mind and is at a distance continues always invariably the same but the visible object still changing as you approach to or recede from the tangible object it hath no fixed and determinate greatness whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of anything for instance a tree or a house we must mean the tangible magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity spoken of it but though the tangible and visible magnitude in truth belong to two distinct objects i shall nevertheless especially since those objects are called by the same name and are observed to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech sometimes speak of them as belonging to one and the same thing now in order to discover by what means the magnitude of tangible objects is perceived by sight i need only reflect on what passes in my own mind and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my thoughts when i look on any object and these i find to be first the magnitude or extension of the visible object which being immediately perceived by sight is connected with that other which is tangible and placed at a distance secondly the confusion or distinctness and thirdly the vigorousness or faintness of the aforesaid visible appearance ceteris paribus by how much the greater or lesser the visible object is by so much the greater or lesser do i conclude the tangible object to be but be the idea immediately perceived by sight never so large yet if it be withal confused i judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small if it be distinct and clear i judge it greater and if it be faint i apprehend it to be yet greater what is here meant by confusion and faintness hath been explained in sect moreover the judgments we make of greatness do in like manner as those of distance depend on the disposition of the eye also on the figure number and situation of objects and other circumstances that have been observed to attend great or small tangible magnitudes thus for instance the very same quantity of visible extension which in the figure of a tower doth suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude that this is owing to the experience we have had of the usual bigness of a tower and a man no one i suppose need be told it is also evident that confusion or faintness have no more a necessary connexion with little or great magnitude than they have with little or great distance as they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our minds and by consequence if it were not for experience we should no more judge a faint or confused appearance to be connected with great or little magnitude than we should that it was connected with great or little distance nor will it be found that great or small visible magnitude hath any necessary relation to great or small tangible magnitude so that the one may certainly be inferred from the other but before we come to the proof of this it is fit we consider the difference there is betwixt the extension and figure which is the proper object of touch and that other which is termed visible and how the former is principally though not immediately taken notice of when we look at any object this has been before mentioned but we shall here inquire into the cause thereof we regard the objects that environ us in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or injure our own bodies and thereby produce in our minds the sensation of pleasure or pain now bodies operating on our organs by an immediate application and the hurt or advantage arising therefrom depending altogether on the tangible and not at all on the visible qualities of any object this is a plain reason why those should be regarded by us much more than these and for this end the visive sense seems to have been bestowed on animals to wit that by the perception of visible ideas which in themselves are not capable of affecting or any wise altering the frame of their bodies they may be able to foresee from the experience they have had what tangible ideas are connected with such and such visible ideas and damage or benefit which is like to ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance which foresight how necessary it is to the preservation of an animal everyones experience can inform him hence it is that when we look at an object the tangible figure and extension thereof are principally attended to whilst there is small heed taken of the visible figure and magnitude which though more immediately perceived do less concern us and are not fitted to produce any alteration in our bodies that the matter of fact is true will be evident to anyone who considers that a man placed at ten foot distance is thought as great as if he were placed at a distance only of five foot which is true not with relation to the visible but tangible greatness of the object the visible magnitude being far greater at one station than it is at the other inches feet etc are settled stated lengths whereby we measure objects and estimate their magnitude we say for example an object appears to be six inches or six foot long now that this cannot be meant of visible inches etc is evident because a visible inch is itself no constant determinate magnitude and cannot therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of any other thing take an inch marked upon a ruler view it successively at the distance of half a foot a foot a foot and a half etc from the eye at each of which and at all the intermediate distances the inch shall have a different visible extension ie there shall be more or fewer points discerned in it now i ask which of all these various extensions is that stated determinate one that is agreed on for a common measure of other magnitudes no reason can be assigned why we should pitch on one more than another and except there be some invariable determinate extension fixed on to be marked to the word inch it is plain it can be used to little purpose and to say a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more than that it is extended without bringing any particular idea of that extension into the mind farther an inch and a foot from different distances shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times greater than the other from all which it is manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of objects by sight are altogether in reference to their tangible extension whenever we say an object is great or small of this or that determinate measure i say it must be meant of the tangible and not the visible extension which though immediately perceived is nevertheless little taken notice of now that there is no necessary connexion between these two distinct extensions is evident from hence because our eyes might have been framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were less than the minimum tangibile in which case it is not impossible we might have perceived all the immediate objects of sight the very same that we do now but unto those visible appearances there would not be connected those different tangible magnitudes that are now which shows the judgments we make of the magnitude of things placed at a distance from the various greatness of the immediate objects of sight do not arise from any essential or necessary but only a customary tie which has been observed between them moreover it is not only certain that any idea of sight might not have been connected with this or that idea of touch which we now observe to accompany it but also that the greater visible magnitudes might have been connected with and introduced into our minds lesser tangible magnitudes and the lesser visible magnitudes greater tangible magnitudes nay that it actually is so we have daily experience that object which makes a strong and large appearance not seeming near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof is much less but more faint and the appearance upper or which is the same thing painted lower on the retina which faintness and situation suggest both greater magnitude and greater distance from which and from sect and it is manifest that as we do not perceive the magnitudes of objects immediately by sight so neither do we perceive them by the mediation of anything which has a necessary connexion with them those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes of external objects before we touch them might possibly have suggested no such thing or they might have signified them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might as well have served to make us conclude it great those ideas being in their own nature equally fitted to bring into our minds the idea of small or great or no size at all of outward objects just as the words of any language are in their own nature indifferent to signify this or that thing or nothing at all as we see distance so we see magnitude and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the looks of a man those passions are themselves invisible they are nevertheless let in by the eye along with colours and alterations of countenance which are the immediate object of vision and which signify them for no other reason than barely because they have been observed to accompany them without which experience we should no more have taken blushing for a sign of shame than of gladness we are nevertheless exceeding prone to imagine those things which are perceived only by the mediation of others to be themselves the immediate objects of sight or at least to have in their own nature a fitness to be suggested by them before ever they had been experienced to coexist with them from which prejudice everyone perhaps will not find it easy to emancipate himself by any but the clearest convictions of reason and there are some grounds to think that if there was one only invariable and universal languages in the world and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it it would be the opinion of many that the ideas of other mens minds were properly perceived by the ear or had at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds that were affixed to them all which seems to arise from want of a due application of our discerning faculty thereby to discriminate between the ideas that are in our understandings and consider them apart from each other which would preserve us from confounding those that are different and make us see what ideas do and what do not include or imply this or that other idea there is a celebrated phenomenon the solution whereof i shall attempt to give by the principles that have been laid down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects the apparent magnitude of the moon when placed in the horizon is much greater than when it is in the meridian though the angle under which the diameter of the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in the latter and the horizontal moon doth not constantly appear of the same bigness but at some times seemeth far greater than at others now in order to explain the reason of the moons appearing greater than ordinary in the horizon it must be observed that the particles which compose our atmosphere intercept the rays of light proceeding from any object to the eye and by how much the greater is the portion of atmosphere interjacent between the object and the eye by so much the more are the rays intercepted and by consequence the appearance of the object rendered more faint every object appearing more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it sendeth more or fewer rays into the eye now between the eye and the moon when situated in the horizon there lies a far greater quantity of atmosphere than there does when the moon is in the meridian whence it comes to pass that the appearance of the horizontal moon is fainter and therefore by sect it should be thought bigger in that situation than in the meridian or in any other elevation above the horizon farther the air being variously impregnated sometimes more and sometimes less with vapours and exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the rays of light it follows that the appearance of the horizontal moon hath not always an equal faintness and by consequence that luminary though in the very same situation is at one time judged greater than at another that we have here given the true account of the phenomena of the horizontal moon will i suppose be farther evident to anyone from the following considerations first it is plain that which in this case suggests the idea of greater magnitude must be something which is itself perceived for that which is unperceived cannot suggest to our perception any other thing secondly it must be something that does not constantly remain the same but is subject to some change or variation since the appearance of the horizontal moon varies being at one time greater than at another and yet thirdly it cannot be the visible figure or magnitude since that remains the same or is rather lesser by how much the moon is nearer to the horizon it remains therefore that the true cause is that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceeds from the greater paucity of rays arriving at the eye and which i term faintness since this answers all the forementioned conditions and i am not conscious of any other perception that doth add to this that in misty weather it is a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon is far larger than usual which greatly conspires with and strengthens our opinion neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have said if the horizontal moon should chance sometimes to seem enlarged beyond its usual extent even in more serene weather for we must not only have regard to the mist which happens to be in the place where we stand we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapours and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon all which cooperating to render the appearance of the moon more faint and thereby increase its magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually does even in the horizontal position at a time when though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the place where we stand yet the air between the eye and the moon taken all together may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed vapours and exhalations than at other times it may be objected that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque which may intercept a great part of the rays of light should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it is viewed in the horizon to which i answer it is not faintness anyhow applied that suggests greater magnitude there being no necessary but only an experimental connexion between those two things it follows that the faintness which enlarges the appearance must be applied in such sort and with such circumstances as have been observed to attend the vision of great magnitudes when from a distance we behold great objects the particles of the intermediate air and vapours which are themselves unperceivable do interrupt the rays of light and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid now faintness of appearance caused in this sort hath been experienced to coexist with great magnitude but when it is caused by the interposition of an opaque sensible body this circumstance alters the case so that a faint appearance this way caused doth not suggest greater magnitude because it hath not been experienced to coexist with it faintness as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance doth it in the same way that words suggest the notions to which they are annexed now it is known a word pronounced with certain circumstances or in a certain context with other words hath not always the same import and signification that it hath when pronounced in some other circumstances or different context of words the very same visible appearance as to faintness and all other respects if placed on high shall not suggest the same magnitude that it would if it were seen at an equal distance on a level with the eye the reason whereof is that we are rarely accustomed to view objects at a great height our concerns lie among things situated rather before than above us and accordingly our eyes are not placed on the top of our heads but in such a position as is most convenient for us to see distant objects standing in our way and this situation of them being a circumstance which usually attends the vision of distant objects we may from hence account for what is commonly observed an objects appearing of different magnitude even with respect to its horizontal extension on the top of a steeple for example an hundred feet high to one standing below from what it would if placed at an hundred feet distance on a level with his eye for it hath been shown that the judgment we make on the magnitude of a thing depends not on the visible appearance alone but also on divers other circumstances any one of which being omitted or varied may suffice to make some alteration in our judgment hence the circumstances of viewing a distant object in such a situation as is usual and suits with the ordinary posture of the head and eyes being omitted and instead thereof a different situation of the object which requires a different posture of the head taking place it is not to be wondered at if the magnitude be judged different but it will be demanded why an high object should constantly appear less than an equidistant low object of the same dimensions for so it is observed to be it may indeed be granted that the variation of some circumstances may vary the judgment made on the magnitude of high objects which we are less used to look at but it does not hence appear why they should be judged less rather than greater i answer that in case the magnitude of distant objects was suggested by the extent of their visible appearance alone and thought proportional thereto it is certain they would then be judged much less than now they seem to be vide sect but several circumstances concurring to form the judgment we make on the magnitude of distant objects by means of which they appear far larger than others whose visible appearance hath an equal or even greater extension it follows that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which are wont to attend the vision of distant objects and so come to influence the judgments made on their magnitude they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would for any of those things that caused an object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible extension being either omitted or applied without the usual circumstances the judgment depends more entirely on the visible extension and consequently the object must be judged less thus in the present case the situation of the thing seen being different from what it usually is in those objects we have occasion to view and whose magnitude we observe it follows that the very same object being an hundred feet high should seem less than if it was an hundred feet off on or nearly on a level with the eye what has been here set forth seems to me to have no small share in contributing to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon and deserves not to be passed over in the explication of it if we attentively consider the phenomenon before us we shall find the not discerning between the mediate and immediate objects of sight to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occurs in the explication of it the magnitude of the visible moon or that which is the proper and immediate object of vision is not greater when the moon is in the horizon than when it is in the meridian how comes it therefore to seem greater in one situation than the other what is it can put this cheat on the understanding it has no other perception of the moon than what it gets by sight and that which is seen is of the same extent i say the visible appearance hath the same or rather a less magnitude when the moon is viewed in the horizontal than when in the meridional position and yet it is esteemed greater in the former than in the latter herein consists the difficulty which doth vanish and admit of a most easy solution if we consider that as the visible moon is not greater in the horizon than in the meridian so neither is it thought to be so it hath been already shown that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely or in itself is little taken notice of the mind still carrying its view from that to some tangible ideas which have been observed to be connected with it and by that means come to be suggested by it so that when a thing is said to appear great or small or whatever estimate be made of the magnitude of any thing this is meant not of the visible but of the tangible object this duly considered it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seeming contradiction there is that the moon should appear of a different bigness the visible magnitude thereof remaining still the same for by sect the very same visible extension with a different faintness shall suggest a different tangible extension when therefore the horizontal moon is said to appear greater than the meridional moon this must be understood not of a greater visible extension but a of greater tangible or real extension which by reason of the more than ordinary faintness of the visible appearance is suggested to the mind along with it many attempts have been made by learned men to account for this appearance gassendus descartes hobbes and several others have employed their thoughts on that subject but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavours have been is sufficiently shown in the transactionsphil trans num p where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confuted not without some surprize at the gross blunders that ingenious men have been forced into by endeavouring to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary principles of optics since the writing of which there hath been published in the transactions numb p another paper relating to the same affair by the celebrated dr wallis wherein he attempts to account for that phenomenon which though it seems not to contain anything new or different from what had been said before by others i shall nevertheless consider in this place his opinion in short is this we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the visual angle alone but by the visual angle in conjunction with the distance hence though the angle remain the same or even become less yet if withal the distance seem to have been increased the object shall appear greater now one way whereby we estimate the distance of anything is by the number and extent of the intermediate objects when therefore the moon is seen in the horizon the variety of fields houses etc together with the large prospect of the wide extended land or sea that lies between the eye and the utmost limb of the horizon suggest unto the mind the idea of greater distance and consequently magnify the appearance and this according to dr wallis is the true account of the extraordinary largeness attributed by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtended by its diameter is not one jot greater than it used to be with reference to this opinion not to repeat what hath been already said concerning distance i shall only observe first that if the prospect of interjacent objects be that which suggests the idea of farther distance and this idea of farther distance be the cause that brings into the mind the idea of greater magnitude it should hence follow that if one looked at the horizontal moon from behind a wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary for in that case the wall interposing cuts off all that prospect of sea and land etc which might otherwise increase the apparent distance and thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon nor will it suffice to say the memory doth even then suggest all that extent of land etc which lies within the horizon which suggestion occasions a sudden judgment of sense that the moon is farther off and larger than usual for ask any man who from such a station beholding the horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual whether he hath at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate objects or long tract of land that lies between his eye and the extreme edge of the horizon and whether it be that idea which is the cause of his making the aforementioned judgment he will i suppose reply in the negative and declare the horizontal moon shall appear greater than the meridional though he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it secondly it seems impossible by this hypothesis to account for the moons appearing in the very same situation at one time greater than at another which nevertheless has been shown to be very agreeable to the principles we have laid down and receives a most easy and natural explication from them for the further clearing up of this point it is to be observed that what we immediately and properly see are only lights and colours in sundry situations and shades and degrees of faintness and clearness confusion and distinctness all which visible objects are only in the mind nor do they suggest ought external whether distance or magnitude otherwise than by habitual connexion as words do things we are also to remark that beside the straining of the eyes and beside the vivid and faint the distinct and confused appearances which bearing some proportion to lines and angles have been substituted instead of them in the foregoing part of this treatise there are other means which suggest both distance and magnitude particularly the situation of visible points of objects as upper or lower the one suggesting a farther distance and greater magnitude the other a nearer distance and lesser magnitude all which is an effect only of custom and experience there being really nothing intermediate in the line of distance between the uppermost and lowermost which are both equidistant or rather at no distance from the eye as there is also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connexion should suggest greater or lesser magnitude now as these customary experimental means of suggesting distance do likewise suggest magnitude so they suggest the one as immediately as the other i say they do not vide sect first suggest distance and then leave the mind from thence to infer or compute magnitude jut suggest magnitude as immediately and directly as they suggest distance this phenomenon of the horizontal moon is a clear instance of the insufficiency of lines and angles for explaining the way wherein the mind perceives and estimates the magnitude of outward objects there is nevertheless a use of computation by them in order to determine the apparent magnitude of things so far as they have a connexion with and are proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which are the true and immediate occasions that suggest to the mind the apparent magnitude of things but this in general may i think be observed concerning mathematical computation in optics that it can never be very precise and exact since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do often depend on several circumstances which are not proportionable to or capable of being defined by lines and angles from what has been said we may safely deduce this consequence to wit that a man born blind and made to see would at first opening of his eyes make a very different judgment of the magnitude of objects intromitted by them from what others do he would not consider the ideas of sight with reference to or as having any connexion with the ideas of touch his view of them being entirely terminated within themselves he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible points now it being certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from view only one other visible point it follows that whatever object intercepts the view of another hath an equal number of visible points with it and consequently they shall both be thought by him to have the same magnitude hence it is evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb with which he might hide a tower or hinder its being seen equal to that tower or his hand the interposition whereof might conceal experimental means the firmament from his view equal to the firmament how great an inequality soever there may in our apprehensions seem to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close connexion that has grown up in our minds between the objects of sight and touch whereby the very different and distinct ideas of those two senses are so blended and confounded together as to be mistaken for one and the same thing out of which prejudice we cannot easily extricate ourselves for the better explaining the nature of vision and setting the manner wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light i shall proceed to make some observations concerning matters relating thereto whereof the want of reflexion and duly separating between tangible and visible ideas is apt to create in us mistaken and confused notions and first i shall observe that the minimum visibile is exactly equal in all beings whatsoever that are endowed with the visive faculty no exquisite formation of the eye no peculiar sharpness of sight can make it less in one creature than in another for it not being distinguishable into parts nor in any wise a consisting of them it must necessarily be the same to all for suppose it otherwise and that the minimum visibile of a mite for instance be less than the minimum visibile of a man the latter therefore may by detraction of some part be made equal to the former it doth therefore consist of parts which is inconsistent with the notion of a minimum visibile or point it will perhaps be objected that the minimum visibile of a man doth really and in itself contain parts whereby it surpasses that of a mite though they are not perceivable by the man to which i answer the minimum visibile having in like manner as all other the proper and immediate objects of sight been shown not to have any existence without the mind of him who sees it it follows there cannot be any pan of it that is not actually perceived and therefore visible now for any object to contain distinct visible parts and at the same time to be a minimum visibile is a manifest contradiction of these visible points we see at all times an equal number it is every whit as great when our view is contracted and bounded by near objects as when it is extended to larger and remoter for it being impossible that one minimum visibile should obscure or keep out of sight mote than one other it is a plain consequence that when my view is on all sides bounded by the walls of my study see just as many visible points as i could in case that by the removal of the studywalls and all other obstructions i had a full prospect of the circumjacent fields mountains sea and open firmament for so long as i am shut up within the walls by their interposition every point of the external objects is covered from my view but each point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from sight one only other corresponding point it follows that whilst my sight is confined to those narrow walls i see as many points or minima visibilia as i should were those walls away by looking on all the external objects whose prospect is intercepted by them whenever therefore we are said to have a greater prospect at one time than another this must be understood with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate objects of vision which as hath been shown properly belong to the touch the visive faculty considered with reference to its immediate objects may be found to labour of two defects first in respect of the extent or number of visible points that are at once perceivable by it which is narrow and limited to a certain degree it can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of minima visibilia beyond which it cannot extend its prospect secondly our sight is defective in that its view is not only narrow but also for the most part confused of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly and the more we fix our sight on any one object by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear corresponding to these two defects of sight we may imagine as many perfections to wit st that of comprehending in one view a greater number of visible points dly of being able to view them all equally and at once with the utmost clearness and distinction that those perfections are not actually in some intelligences of a different order and capacity from ours it is impossible for us to know in neither of those two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of sight for when we look through a microscope we neither see more visible points nor are the collateral points more distinct than when we look with the naked eye at objects placed in a due distance a microscope brings us as it were into a new world it presents us with a new scene of visible objects quite different from what we behold with the naked eye but herein consists the most remarkable difference to wit that whereas the objects perceived by the eye alone have a certain connexion with tangible objects whereby we are taught to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant objects to the parts of our own body which much conduceth to its preservation there is not the like connexion between things tangible and those visible objects that are perceived by help of a fine microscope hence it is evident that were our eyes turned into the nature of microscopes we should not be much benefited by the change we should be deprived of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by the visive faculty and have left us only the empty amusement of seeing without any other benefit arising from it but in that case it will perhaps be said our sight would be endued with a far greater sharpness and penetration than it now hath but it is certain from what we have already shown that the minimum visibile is never greater or lesser but in all cases constantly the same and in the case of microscopical eyes i see only this difference to wit that upon the ceasing of a certain observable connexion betwixt the divers perceptions of sight and touch which before enabled us to regulate our actions by the eye it would now be rendered utterly unserviceable to that purpose upon the whole it seems that if we consider the use and end of sight together with the present state and circumstances of our being we shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or imperfection in it or easily conceive how it could be mended with such admirable wisdom is that faculty contrived both for the pleasure and convenience of life having finished what i intended to say concerning the distance and magnitude of objects i come now to treat of the manner wherein the mind perceives by sight their situation among the discoveries of the last age it is reputed none of the least that the manner of vision hath been more clearly explained than ever it had been before there is at this day no one ignorant that the pictures of external objects are painted on the retina or fund of the eye that we can see nothing which is not so painted and that according as the picture is more distinct or confused so also is the perception we have of the object but then in this explication of vision there occurs one mighty difficulty the objects are painted in an inverted order on the bottom of the eye the upper part of any object being painted on the lower part of the eye and the lower part of the object on the upper part of the eye and so also as to right and left since therefore the pictures are thus inverted it is demanded how it comes to pass that we see the objects erect and in their natural posture in answer to this difficulty we are told that the mind perceiving an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye considers this ray as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object and in like manner tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of the eye it is directed to the upper part of the object thus in the adjacent figure c the lower point of the object abc is projected on c the upper part of the eye so likewise the highest point a is projected on a the lowest part of the eye which makes the representation cba inverted but the mind considering the stroke that is made on c as coming in the straight line cc from the lower end of the object and the stroke or impulse on a as coming in the line aa from the upper end of the object is directed to make a right judgment of the situation of the object abc notwithstanding the picture of it is inverted this is illustrated by conceiving a blind man who holding in his hands two sticks that cross each other doth with them touch the extremities of an object placed in a perpendicular situation it is certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the object which he touches with the stick held in the undermost hand and that to be the lower part of the object which he touches with the stick in his uppermost hand this is the common explication of the erect appearance of objects which is generally received and acquiesced in being as mr molyneux tells us diopt par c p allowed by all men as satisfactory but this account to me does not seem in any degree true did i perceive those impulses decussations and directions of the rays of light in like manner as hath been set forth then indeed it would not be altogether void of probability and there might be some pretence for the comparison of the blind man and his cross sticks but the case is far otherwise i know very well that i perceive no such thing and of consequence i cannot thereby make an estimate of the situation of objects i appeal to anyones experience whether he be conscious to himself that he thinks on the intersection made by the radious sic pencils or pursues the impulses they give in right lines whenever he perceives by sight the position of any object to me it seems evident that crossing and tracing of the rays is never thought on by children idiots or in truth by any other save only those who have applied themselves to the study of optics and for the mind to judge of the situation of objects by those things without perceiving them or to perceive them without knowing it is equally beyond my comprehension add to this that the explaining the manner of vision by the example of cross sticks and hunting for the object along the axes of the radious pencils doth suppose the proper objects of sight to be perceived at a distance from us contrary to what hath been demonstrated it remains therefore that we look for some other explication of this difficulty and i believe it not impossible to find one provided we examine it to the bottom and carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch which cannot be too oft inculcated in treating of vision but more especially throughout the consideration of this affair we ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts for that from want of a right understanding thereof the difficulty of explaining erect vision seems chiefly to arise in order to disentangle our minds from whatever prejudices we may entertain with relation to the subject in hand nothing seems more apposite than the taking into our thoughts the case of one born blind and afterwards when grown up made to see and though perhaps it may not be an easy task to divest ourselves entirely of the experience received from sight so as to be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a ones we must nevertheless as far as possible endeavour to frame true conceptions of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in his mind it is certain that a man actually blind and who had continued so from his birth would by the sense of feeling attain to have ideas of upper and lower by the motion of his hand he might discern the situation of any tangible object placed within his fi reach that part on which he felt himself supported or towards which he perceived his body to gravitate he would term lower and the contrary to this upper and accordingly denominate whatsoever objects he touched but then whatever judgments he makes concerning the situation of objects are confined to those only that are perceivable by touch all those things that are intangible and of a spiritual nature his thoughts and desires his passions and in general all the modifications of the soul to these he would never apply the terms upper and lower except only in a metaphorical sense he may perhaps by way of allusion speak of high or low thoughts but those terms in their proper signification would never be applied to anything that was not conceived to exist without the mind for a man born blind and remaining in the same state could mean nothing else by the words higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body it is therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other would by him be thought higher or lower must be such as were conceived to exist without his mind in the ambient space whence it plainly follows that such a one if we suppose him made to see would not at first sight think anything he saw was high or low erect or inverted for it hath been already demonstrated in sect that he would not think the things he perceived by sight to be at any distance from him or without his mind the objects to which he had hitherto been used to apply the terms up and down high and low were such only as affected or were some way perceived by his couch but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch there is therefore nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms applicable to them nor would he ever think it till such time as he had observed their connexion with tangible objects and the same prejudice began to insinuate itself into his understanding which from their infancy had grown up in the understandings of other men to set this matter in a clearer light i shall make use of an example suppose the abovementioned blind person by his touch perceives a man to stand erect let us inquire into the manner of this by the application of his hand to the several parts of a human body he had perceived different tangible ideas which being collected into sundry complex ones have distinct names annexed to them thus one combination of a certain tangible figure bulk and consistency of parts is called the head another the hand a third the foot and so of the rest all which complex ideas could in his understanding be made up only of ideas perceivable by touch he had also by his touch obtained an idea of earth or ground towards which he perceives the parts of his body to have a natural tendency now by erect nothing more being meant than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet are nearest to the earth if the blind person by moving his hand over the parts of the man who stands before him perceives the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest from and those that compose the feet to be nearest to that other combination of tangible ideas which he calls earth he will denominate that man erect but if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his sight and that he behold a man standing before him it is evident in that case he would neither judge the man he sees to be erect nor inverted for he never having known those terms applied to any other save tangible things or which existed in the space without him and what he sees neither being tangible nor perceived as existing without he could not know that in propriety of language they were applicable to it afterwards when upon turning his head or eyes up and down to the right and left he shall observe the visible objects to change and shall also attain to know that they are called by the same names and connected with the objects perceived by touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation in the same terms that he has been used to apply to tangible things and those that he perceives by turning up his eyes he will call upper and those that by turning down his eyes he will call lower and this seems to me the true reason why he should think those objects uppermost that are painted on the lower part of his eye for by turning the eye up they shall be distinctly seen as likewise those that are painted on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly seen by turning the eye down and are for that reason esteemed lowest for we have shown that to the immediate objects of sight considered in themselves he would not attribute the terms high and low it must therefore be on account of some circumstances which are observed to attend them and these it is plain are the actions of turning the eye up and down which suggest a very obvious reason why the mind should denominate the objects of sight accordingly high or low and without this motion of the eye this turning it up and down in order to discern different objects doubtless erect inverse and other the like terms relating to the position of tangible objects would never have been transferred or in any degree apprehended to belong to the ideas of sight the mere act of seeing including nothing in it to that purpose whereas the different situations of the eye naturally direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of objects intromitted by it farther when he has by experience learned the connexion there is between the several ideas of sight and touch he will be able by the perception he has of the situation of visible things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward tangible things corresponding to them and thus it is he shall perceive by sight the situation of external objects which do not properly fall under that sense i know we are very prone to think that if just made to see we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now but we are also as prone to think that at first sight we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of objects as we do now which hath been shown to be a false and groundless persuasion and for the like reasons the same censure may be passed on the positive assurance that most men before they have thought sufficiently of the matter might have of their being able to determine by the eye at first view whether objects were erect or inverse it will perhaps be objected co our opinion that a man for instance being thought erect when his feet are next the earth and inverted when his head is next the earth it doth hence follow that by the mere act of vision without any experience or altering the situation of the eye we should have determined whether he were erect or inverted for both the earth itself and the limbs of the man who stands thereon being equally perceived by sight one cannot choose seeing what part of the man is nearest the earth and what part farthest from it ie whether he be erect or inverted to which i answer the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man are entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man nor was it possible by virtue of the visive faculty alone without superadding any experience of touch or altering the position of the eye ever to have known or so much as suspected there had been any relation or connexion between them hence a man at first view would not denominate anything he saw earth or head or foot and consequently he could not tell by the mere act of vision whether the head or feet were nearest the earth nor indeed would we have thereby any thought of earth or man erect or inverse at all which will be made yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular comparison between the ideas of both senses that which i see is only variety of light and colours that which i feel is hard or soft hot or cold rough or smooth what similitude what connexion have those ideas with these or how is it possible that anyone should see reason to give one and the same name to combinations of ideas so very different before he had experienced their coexistence we do not find there is any necessary connexion betwixt this or that tangible quality and any colour whatsoever and we may sometimes perceive colours where there is nothing to be felt all which doth make it manifest that no man at first receiving of his sight would know there was any agreement between this or that particular object of his sight and any object of touch he had been already acquainted with the colours therefore of the head would to him no more suggest the idea of head than they would the idea of foot farther we have at large shown vid sect and there is no discoverable necessary connexion between any given visible magnitude and any one particular tangible magnitude but that it is entirely the result of custom and experience and depends on foreign and accidental circumstances that we can by the perception of visible extension inform ourselves what may be the extension of any tangible object connected with it hence it is certain that neither the visible magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the mind at first opening of the eyes the respective tangible magnitudes of those parts by the foregoing section it is plain the visible figure of any part of the body hath no necessary connexion with the tangible figure thereof so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind for figure is the termination of magnitude whence it follows that no visible magnitude having in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible figure so as of itself and in a way prior to experience it might suggest it to the understanding this will be farther evident if we consider that what seems smooth and round to the touch may to sight if viewed through a microscope seem quite otherwise from all which laid together and duly considered we may clearly deduce this inference in the first act of vision no idea entering by the eye would have a perceivable connexion with the ideas to which the names earth man head foot etc were annexed in the understanding of a person blind from his birth so as in any sort to introduce them into his mind or make themselves be called by the same names and reputed the same things with them as afterwards they come to be there doth nevertheless remain one difficulty which perhaps may seem to press hard on our opinion and deserve not to be passed over for though it be granted that neither the colour size nor figure of the visible feet have any necessary connexion with the ideas that compose the tangible feet so as to bring them at first sight into my mind or make me in danger of confounding them before i had been used to and for some time experienced their connexion yet thus much seems undeniable namely that the number of the visible feet being the same with that of the tangible feet i may from hence without any experience of sight reasonably conclude that they represent or are connected with the feet rather than the head i say it seems the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head so that the blind man upon first reception of the visive faculty might know which were the feet or two and which the head or one in order to get clear of this seeming difficulty we need only observe that diversity of visible objects doth not necessarily infer diversity of tangible objects corresponding to them a picture painted with great variety of colours affects the touch in one uniform manner it is therefore evident that i do not by any necessary consecution independent of experience judge of the number of things tangible from the number of things visible i should not therefore at first opening my eyes conclude that because i see two i shall feel two how therefore can i before experience teaches me know that the visible legs because two are connected with the tangible legs or the visible head because one is connected with the tangible head the truth is the things i see are so very different and heterogeneous from the things i feel that the perception of the one would never have suggested the other to my thoughts or enabled me to pass the least judgment thereon until i had experienced their connexion but for a fuller illustration of this matter it ought to be considered that number however some may reckon it amongst the primary qualities is nothing fixed and settled really existing in things themselves it is entirely the creature of the mind considering either an idea by itself or any combination of ideas to which it gives one name and so makes it pass for an unit according as the mind variously combines its ideas the unit varies and as the unit so the number which is only a collection of units doth also vary we call a window one a chimney one and yet a house in which there are many windows and many chimneys hath an equal right to be called one and many houses go to the making of the city in these and the like instances it is evident the unit constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of its ideas to which it affixes names and wherein it includes more or less as best suits its own ends and purposes whatever therefore the mind considers as one that is an unit every combination of ideas is considered as one thing by the mind and in token thereof is marked by one name now this naming and combining together of ideas is perfectly arbitrary and done by the mind in such sort as experience shows it to be most convenient without which our ideas had never been collected into such sundry distinct combinations as they now are hence it follows that a man born blind and afterwards when grown up made to see would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up together under one name he would not for example make into one complex idea and thereby esteem an unit all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot for there can be no reason assigned why he should do so barely upon his seeing a man stand upright before him there crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man in company with all the other ideas of sight perceived at the same time but all these ideas offered at once to his view he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such time as by observing the motion of the parts of the man and other experiences he comes to know which are to be separated and which to be collected together from what hath been premised it is plain the objects of sight and touch make if i may so say two sets of ideas which are widely different from each other to objects of either kind we indifferently attribute the terms high and low right and left and suchlike denoting the position or situation of things but then we must well observe that the position of any object is determined with respect only to objects of the same sense we say any object of touch is high or low according as it is more or less distant from the tangible earth and in like manner we denominate any object of sight high or low in proportion as it is more or less distant from the visible earth but to define the situation of visible things with relation to the distance they bear from any tangible thing or vice versa this were absurd and perfectly unintelligible for all visible things are equally in the mind and take up no part of the external space and consequently are equidistant from any tangible thing which exists without the mind or rather to speak truly the proper objects of sight are at no distance neither near nor far from any tangible thing for if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find that those things only are compared together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same sense for by the distance between any two points nothing more is meant than the number of intermediate points if the given points are visible the distance between them is marked out by the number of the interjacent visible points if they are tangible the distance between them is a line consisting of tangible points but if they are one tangible and the other visible the distance between them doth neither consist of points perceivable by sight nor by touch ie it is utterly inconceivable this perhaps will not find an easy admission into all mens understanding however i should gladly be informed whether it be not true by anyone who will be at the pains to reflect a little and apply it home to his thoughts the not observing what has been delivered in the two last sections seems to have occasioned no small part of the difficulty that occurs in the business of erect appearances the head which is painted nearest the earth seems to be farthest from it and on the other hand the feet which are painted farthest from the earth are thought nearest to it herein lies the difficulty which vanishes if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity thus how comes it that to the eye the visible head which is nearest the tangible earth seems farthest from the earth and the visible feet which are farthest from the tangible earth seem nearest the earth the question being thus proposed who sees not the difficulty is founded on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty or rather the soul by means thereof should judge of the situation of visible objects with reference to their distance from the tangible earth whereas it is evident the tangible earth is not perceived by sight and it hath been shown in the two last preceding sections that the location of visible objects is determined only by the distance they bear from one another and that it is nonsense to talk of distance far or near between a visible and tangible thing if we confine our thoughts to the proper objects of sight the whole is plain and easy the head is painted farthest from and the feet nearest to the visible earth and so they appear to be what is there strange or unaccountable in this let us suppose the pictures in the fund of the eye to be the immediate objects of the sight the consequence is that things should appear in the same posture they are painted in and is it not so the head which is seen seems farthest from the earth which is seen and the feet which are seen seem nearest to the earth which is seen and just so they are painted but say you the picture of the man is inverted and yet the appearance is erect i ask what mean you by the picture of the man or which is the same thing the visible mans being inverted you tell me it is inverted because the heels are uppermost and the head undermost explain me this you say that by the heads being undermost you mean that it is nearest to the earth and by the heels being uppermost that they are farthest from the earth i ask again what earth you mean you cannot mean the earth that is painted on the eye or the visible earth for the picture of the head is farthest from the picture of the earth and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth and accordingly the visible head is farthest from the visible earth and the visible feet nearest to it it remains therefore that you mean the tangible earth and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things contrary to what hath been demonstrated in sect and the two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be considered apart and as if their objects had no intercourse no manner of relation one to another in point of distance or position farther what greatly contributes to make us mistake in this matter is that when we think of the pictures in the fund of the eye we imagine ourselves looking on the fund of anothers eye or another looking on the fund of our own eye and beholding the pictures painted thereon suppose two eyes a and b a from some distance looking on the pictures in b sees them inverted and for that reason concludes they are inverted in b but this is wrong there are projected in little on the bottom of a the images of the pictures of suppose man earth etc which are painted on b and besides these the eye b itself and the objects which environ it together with another earth are projected in a larger size on a now by the eye a these larger images are deemed the true objects and the lesser only pictures in miniature and it is with respect to those greater images that it determines the situation of the smaller images so that comparing the little man with the great earth a judges him inverted or that the feet are farthest from and the head nearest to the great earth whereas if a compare the little man with the little earth then he will appear erect ie his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest to the little earth but we must consider that b does not see two earths as a does it sees only what is represented by the little pictures in a and consequently shall judge the man erect for in truth the man in b is not inverted for there the feet are next the earth but it is the representation of it in a which is inverted for there the head of the representation of the picture of the man in b is next the earth and the feet farthest from the earth meaning the earth which is without the representation of the pictures in b for if you take the little images of the pictures in b and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they are all erect and in their natural posture farther there lies a mistake in our imagining that the pictures of external objects are painted on the bottom of the eye it hath been shown there is no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things tangible it hath likewise been demonstrated that the proper objects of sight do not exist without the mind whence it clearly follows that the pictures painted on the bottom of the eye are not the pictures of external objects let anyone consult his own thoughts and then say what affinity what likeness there is between that certain variety and disposition of colours which constitute the visible man or picture of a man and that other combination of far different ideas sensible by touch which compose the tangible man but if this be the case how come they to be accounted pictures or images since that supposes them to copy or represent some originals or other to which i answer in the forementioned instance the eye a takes the little images included within the representation of the other eye b to be pictures or copies whereof the archetypes are not things existing without but the larger pictures projected on its own fund and which by a are not thought pictures but the originals or true things themselves though if we suppose a third eye c from a due distance to behold the fund of a then indeed the things projected thereon shall to c seem pictures or images in the same sense that those projected on b do to a rightly to conceive this point we must carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch between the visible and tangible eye for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either is or seems to be painted again the visible eye as well as all other visible objects hath been shown to exist only in the mind which perceiving its own ideas and comparing them together calls some pictures in respect of others what hath been said being rightly comprehended and laid together doth i think afford a full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of objects which phenomenon i must confess i do not see how it can be explained by any theories of vision hitherto made public in treating of these things the use of language is apt to occasion some obscurity and confusion and create in us wrong ideas for language being accommodated to the common notions and prejudices of men it is scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth without great circumlocution impropriety and to an unwary reader seeming contradictions i do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what i have written concerning vision that he would not stick in this or that phrase or manner of expression but candidly collect my meaning from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse and laying aside the words as much as possible consider the bare notions themselves and then judge whether they are agreeable to truth and his own experience or no we have shown the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas doth perceive or apprehend the distance magnitude and situation of tangible objects we come now to inquire more particularly concerning the difference between the ideas of sight and touch which are called by the same names and see whether there be any idea common to both senses from what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this treatise it is plain there is no one selfsame numerical extension perceived both by sight and touch but that the particular figures and extensions perceived by sight however they may be called by the same names and reputed the same things with those perceived by touch are nevertheless different and have an existence distinct and separate from them so that the question is not now concerning the same numerical ideas but whether there be any one and the same sort of species of ideas equally perceivable to both senses or in other words whether extension figure and motion perceived by sight are not specifically distinct from extension figure and motion perceived by touch but before i come more particularly to discuss this matter i find it proper to consider extension in abstract for of this there is much talk and i am apt to think that when men speak of extension as being an idea common to two senses it is with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all other tangible and visible qualities and form thereof an abstract idea which idea they will have common both to sight and touch we are therefore to understand by extension in abstract an idea of extension for instance a line or surface entirely stripped of all other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it to any particular existence it is neither black nor white nor red nor hath it any colour at all or any tangible quality whatsoever and consequently it is of no finite determinate magnitude for that which bounds or distinguishes one extension from another is some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree now i do not find that i can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my mind such an abstract idea as is here spoken of a line or surface which is neither black nor white nor blue nor yellow etc nor long nor short nor rough nor smooth nor square nor round etc is perfectly incomprehensible this i am sure of as to myself how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can tell it is commonly said that the object of geometry is abstract extension but geometry contemplates figures now figure is the termination of magnitude but we have shown that extension in abstract hath no finite determinate magnitude whence it clearly follows that it can have no figure and consequently is not the object of geometry it is indeed a tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient philosophers that all general truths are concerning universal abstract ideas without which we are told there could be no science no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry but it were no hard matter did i think it necessary to my present purpose to show that propositions and demonstrations in geometry might be universal though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circles after reiterated endeavours to apprehend the general idea a triangle i have found it altogether incomprehensible and surely if anyone were able to introduce that idea into my mind it must be the author of the essay concerning human understanding he who has so far distinguished himself from the generality of writers by the clearness and significancy of what he says let us therefore see how this celebrated author describes the general or abstract idea of a triangle it must be says he neither oblique nor rectangular neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenum but all and none of these at once in effect it is somewhat imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together essay on hum understand b iv c s this is the idea which he thinks needful for the enlargement of knowledge which is the subject of mathematical demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concerning triangles that author acknowledges it doth require some pains and skill to form this general idea of a triangle ibid but had he called to mind what he says in another place to wit that ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the mind ie be conceived vid b iii c s ibid i say had this occurred to his thoughts it is not improbable he would have owned it above all the pains and skill he was master of to form the abovementioned idea of a triangle which is made up of manifest staring contradictions that a man who laid so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising but the wonder will lessen if it be considered that the source whence this opinion flows is the prolific womb which has brought forth innumerable errors and difficulties in all parts of philosophy and in all the sciences but this matter taken in its full extent were a subject too comprehensive to be insisted on in this place and so much for extension in abstract some perhaps may think pure space vacuum or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight yet if i mistake not in the foregoing parts of this essay that hath been clearly demonstrated to be a mere delusion arising from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy which so closely connects the idea of distance with those of sight that we are apt to think it is itself a proper and immediate object of that sense till reason corrects the mistake it having been shown that there are no abstract ideas of figure and that it is impossible for us by any precision of thought to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch the question now remaining is whether the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by touch in answer to which i shall venture to lay down the following proposition the extension figures and motions perceived by sight are specifically distinct from the ideas of touch called by the same names nor is there any such thing as one idea or kind of idea common to both senses this proposition may without much difficulty be collected from what hath been said in several places of this essay but because it seems so remote from and contrary to the received notions and settled opinion of mankind i shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the following arguments when upon perception of an idea i range it under this or that sort it is because it is perceived after the same manner or because it has a likeness or conformity with or affects me in the same way as the ideas of the sort i rank it under in short it must not be entirely new but have something in it old and already perceived by me it must i say have so much at least in common with the ideas i have before known and named as to make me give it the same name with them but it has been if i mistake not clearly made out that a man born blind would not at first reception of his sight think the things he saw were of the same nature with the objects of touch or had anything in common with them but that they were a new set of ideas perceived in a new manner and entirely different from all he had ever perceived before so that he would not call them by the same name nor repute them to be of the same sort with anything he had hitherto known secondly light and colours are allowed by all to constitute a son or species entirely different from the ideas of touch nor will any man i presume say they can make themselves perceived by that sense but there is no other immediate object of sight besides light and colours it is therefore a direct consequence that there is no idea common to both senses it is a prevailing opinion even amongst those who have thought and writ most accurately concerning our ideas and the ways whereby they enter into the understanding that something more is perceived by sight than barely light and colours with their variations mr locke termeth sight the most comprehensive of all our senses conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours which are peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion essay on human understand b ii c s space or distance we have shown is not otherwise the object of sight than of hearing vid sect and as for figure and extension i leave it to anyone that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he had any idea intromitted immediately and properly by sight save only light and colours or whether it de possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all colour and on the other hand whether he can conceive colour without visible extension for my own part i must confess i am not able to attain so great a nicety of abstraction in a strict sense i see nothing but light and colours with their several shades and variations he who beside these doth also perceive by sight ideas far different and distinct from them hath that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than i can pretend to it must be owned that by the mediation of light and colours other far different ideas are suggested to my mind but so they are by hearing which beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense doth by their mediation suggest not only space figure and motion but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words thirdly it is i think an axiom universally received that quantities of the same kind may be added together and make one entire sum mathematicians add lines together but they do not add a line to a solid or conceive it as making one sum with a surface these three kinds of quantity being thought incapable of any such mutual addition and consequently of being compared together in the several ways of proportion are by then esteemed entirely disparate and heterogeneous now let anyone try in his thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or surface so as to conceive them making one continued sum or whole he that can do this may think them homogeneous but he that cannot must by the foregoing axiom think them heterogeneous a blue and a red line i can conceive added together into one sum and making one continued line but to make in my thoughts one continued line of a visible and tangible line added together is i find a task far more difficult and even insurmountable and i leave it to the reflexion and experience of every particular person to determine for himself a farther confirmation of our tenet may be drawn from the solution of mr molyneuxs problem published by mr locke in his essay which i shall set down as it there lies together with mr lockes opinion of it suppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly sic of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and tother which is the cube and which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be made to see quaere whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answers not for though he has obtained the experience of how a globe how a cube affects his touch yet he has not yet attained the experience that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that pressed his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it doth in the cube i agree with this thinking gentleman whom i am proud to call my friend in his answer to this his problem and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them essay on human understanding b ii c s now if a square surface perceived by touch be of the same sort with a square surface perceived by sight it is certain the blind man here mentioned might know a square surface as soon as he saw it it is no more but introducing into his mind by a new inlet an idea he has been already well acquainted with since therefore he is supposed to have known by his touch that a cube is a body terminated by square surfaces and that a sphere is not terminated by square surfaces upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only in numero it follows that he might know by the unerring mark of the square surfaces which was the cube and which not while he only saw them we must therefore allow either that visible extension and figures are specifically distinct from tangible extension and figures or else that the solution of this problem given by those two thoughtful and ingenious men is wrong much more might be laid together in proof of the proposition i have advanced but what has been said is if i mistake not sufficient to convince anyone that shall yield a reasonable attention and as for those that will not be at the pains of a little thought no multiplication of words will ever suffice to make them understand the truth or rightly conceive my meaning i cannot let go the abovementioned problem without some reflexion on it it hath been evident that a man blind from his birth would not at first sight denominate anything he saw by the names he had been used to appropriate to ideas of touch vid sect cube sphere table are words he has known applied to things perceivable by touch but to things perfectly intangible he never knew them applied those words in their wonted application always marked out to his mind bodies or solid things which were perceived by the resistance they gave but there is no solidity no resistance or protrusion perceived by sight in short the ideas of sight are all new perceptions to which there be no names annexed in his mind he cannot therefore understand what is said to him concerning them and to ask of the two bodies he saw placed on the table which was the sphere which the cube were to him a question downright bantering and unintelligible nothing he sees being able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body distance or in general of anything he had already known it is a mistake to think the same thing affects both sight and touch if the same angle or square which is the object of touch be also the object of vision what should hinder the blind man at first sight from knowing it for though the manner wherein it affects the sight be different from that wherein it affected his touch yet there being beside his manner or circumstance which is new and unknown the angle or figure which is old and known he cannot choose but discern it visible figure and extension having been demonstrated to be of a nature entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and extension it remains that we inquire concerning now that visible motion is not of the same sort with tangible motion seems to need no farther proof it being an evident corollary from what we have shown concerning the difference there is between visible and tangible extension but for a more full and express proof hereof we need only observe that one who had not yet experienced vision would not at first sight know motion whence it clearly follows that motion perceivable by sight is of a sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch the antecedent i prove thus by touch he could not perceive any motion but what was up or down to the right or left nearer or farther from him besides these and their several varieties or complications it is impossible he should have any idea of motion he would not therefore think anything to be motion or give the name motion to any idea which he could not range under some or other of those particular kinds thereof but from sect it is plain that by the mere act of vision he could not know motion upwards or downwards to the right or left or in any other possible direction from which i conclude he would not know motion at all at first sight as for the idea of motion in abstract i shall not waste paper about it but leave it to my reader to make the best he can of it to me it is perfectly unintelligible the consideration of motion may furnish a new field for inquiry but since the manner wherein the mind apprehends by sight the motion of tangible objects with the various degrees thereof may be easily collected from what hath been said concerning the manner wherein that sense doth suggest their various distances magnitudes and situations i shall not enlarge any farther on this subject but proceed to consider what may be alleged with greatest appearance of reason against the proposition we have shown to be true for where there is so much prejudice to be encountered a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice we must also satisfy the scruples that men may raise in favour of their preconceived notions show whence the mistake arises how it came to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the mind first therefore it will be demanded how visible extension and figures come to be called by the same name with tangible extension and figures if they are not of the same kind with them it must be something more than humour or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this which has obtained in all ages and nations of the world and amongst all ranks of men the learned as well as the illiterate to which i answer we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their being called by the same name than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consisting of six letters whereby it is marked are of the same species because they are both called by the same name it is customary to call written words and the things they signify by the same name for words not being regarded in their own nature or otherwise than as they are marks of things it had been superfluous and beside the design of language to have given them names distinct from those of the things marked by them the same reason holds here also visible figures are the marks of tangible figures and from sect it is plain that in themselves they are little regarded or upon any other score than for their connexion with tangible figures which by nature they are ordained to signify and because this language of nature doth not vary in different ages or nations hence it is that in all times and places visible figures are called by the same names as the respective tangible figures suggested by them and not because they are alike or of the same sort with them but say you surely a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle it has four angles and as many sides so also has the visible square but the visible circle has no such thing being bounded by one uniform curve without right lines or angles which makes it unfit to represent the tangible square but very fit to represent the tangible circle whence it clearly follows that visible figures are patterns of or of the same species with the respective tangible figures represented by them that they are like unto them and of their own nature fitted to represent them as being of the same sort and that they are in no respect arbitrary signs as words i answer it must be acknowledged the visible square is fitter than the visible circle to represent the tangible square but then it is not because it is liker or more of a species with it but because the visible square contains in it several distinct parts whereby to mark the several distinct corresponding parts of a tangible square whereas the visible circle doth not the square perceived by touch hath four distinct equal sides so also hath it four distinct equal angles it is therefore necessary that the visible figure which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal parts corresponding to the four sides of the tangible square as likewise four other distinct and equal parts whereby to denote the four equal angles of the tangible square and accordingly we see the visible figures contain in them distinct visible parts answering to the distinct tangible parts of the figures signified or suggested by them but it will not hence follow that any visible figure is like unto or of the same species with its corresponding tangible figure unless it be also shown that not only the number but also the kind of the parts be the same in both to illustrate this i observe that visible figures represent tangible figures much after the same manner that written words do sounds now in this respect words are not arbitrary it not being indifferent what written word stands for any sound but it is requisite that each word contain in it so many distinct characters as there are variations in the sound it stands for thus the single letter a is proper to mark one simple uniform sound and the word adultery is accommodated to represent the sound annexed to it in the formation whereof there being eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the organs of speech each of which produces a difference of sound it was fit the word representing it should consist of as many distinct characters thereby to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound and yet nobody i presume will say the single letter a or the word adultery are like unto or of the same species with the respective sounds by them represented it is indeed arbitrary that in general letters of any language represent sounds at all but when that is once agreed it is not arbitrary what combination of letters shall represent this or that particular sound i leave this with the reader to pursue and apply it in his own thoughts it must be confessed that we are not so apt to confound other signs with the things signified or to think them of the same species as we are visible and tangible ideas but a little consideration will show us how this may be without our supposing them of a like nature these signs are constant and universal their connexion with tangible ideas has been learnt at our first entrance into the world and ever since almost every moment of our lives it has been occurring to our thoughts and fastening and striking deeper on our minds when we observe that signs are variable and of human institution when we remember there was a time they were not connected in our minds with those things they now so readily suggest but that their signification was learned by the slow steps of experience this preserves us from confounding them but when we find the same signs suggest the same things all over the world when we know they are not of human institution and cannot remember that we ever learned their signification but think that at first sight they would have suggested to us the same things they do now all this persuades us they are of the same species as the things respectively represented by them and that it is by a natural resemblance they suggest them to our minds add to this that whenever we make a nice survey of any object successively directing the optic axis to each point thereof there are certain lines and figures described by the motion of the head or eye which being in truth perceived by feeling do nevertheless so mix themselves as it were with the ideas of sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense again the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than is usual in the other senses beside the touch sounds for example perceived at the same instant are apt to coalesce if i may so say into one sound but we can perceive at the same time great variety of visible objects very separate and distinct from each other now tangible extension being made up of several distinct coexistent parts we may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a likeness or an analogy between the immediate objects of sight and touch but nothing certainly doth more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close connexion they have with each other we cannot open our eyes but the ideas of distance bodies and tangible figures are suggested by them so swift and sudden and unperceived is the transition from visible to tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear thinking them equally the immediate object of vision the prejudice which is grounded on these and whatever other causes may be assigned thereof sticks so fast that it is impossible without obstinate striving and labour of the mind to get entirely clear of it but then the reluctancy we find in rejecting any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever considers what has been already shown with regard to the prejudices we entertain concerning the distance magnitude and situation of objects prejudices so familiar to our minds so confirmed and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest demonstration upon the whole i think we may fairly conclude that the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the author of nature whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and wellbeing of our bodies as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them it is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life and the manner wherein they signify and mark unto us the objects which are at a distance is the same with that of languages and signs of human appointment which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or identity of nature but only by an habitual connexion that experience has made us to observe between them suppose one who had always continued blind be told by his guide that after he has advanced so many steps he shall come to the brink of a precipice or be stopped by a wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprizing he cannot conceive how it is possible for mortals to frame such predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as prophesy doth to others even they who are blessed with the visive faculty may though familiarity make it less observed find therein sufficient cause of admiration the wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it is adjusted to those ends and purposes for which it was apparently designed the vast extent number and variety of objects that are at once with so much ease and quickness and pleasure suggested by it all these afford subject for much and pleasing speculation and may if anything give us some glimmering analogous prenotion of things which are placed beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of our present state i do not design to trouble myself with drawing corollaries from the doctrine i have hitherto laid down if it bears the test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their thoughts in extending it farther and applying it to whatever purposes it may be subservient to only i cannot forbear making some inquiry concerning the object of geometry which the subject we have been upon doth naturally lead one to we have shown there is no such idea as that of extension in abstract and that there are two kinds of sensible extension and figures which are entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other now it is natural to inquire which of these is the object of geometry some things there are which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension the constant use of the eyes both in the practical and speculative parts of that science doth very much induce us thereto it would without doubt seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagrams he saw upon paper were not the figures or even the likeness of the figures which make the subject of the demonstration the contrary being held an unquestionable truth not only by mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic i mean who consider the nature of science certainty and demonstration it being by them assigned as one reason of the extraordinary clearness and evidence of geometry that in this science the reasonings are free from those inconveniences which attend the use of arbitrary signs the very ideas themselves being copied out and exposed to view upon paper but by the bye how well this agrees with what they likewise assert of abstract ideas being the object of geometrical demonstration i leave to be considered to come to a resolution in this point we need only observe what hath been said in sect where it is shown that visible extensions in themselves are little regarded and have no settled determinable greatness and that men measure altogether by the application of tangible extension to tangible extension all which makes it evident that visible extension and figures are not the object of geometry it is therefore plain that visible figure are of the same use in geometry that words are and the one may as well be accounted the object of that science as the other neither of them being otherwise concerned therein than as they represent or suggest to the mind the particular tangible figures connected with them there is indeed this difference between the signification of tangible figures by visible figures and of ideas by words that whereas the latter is variable and uncertain depending altogether on the arbitrary appointment of men the former is fixed and immutably the same in all times and places a visible square for instance suggests to the mind the same tangible figure in europe that it doth in america hence it is that the voice of the author of nature which speaks to our eyes is not liable to that misinterpretation and ambiguity that languages of human contrivance are unavoidably subject to though what has been said may suffice to show what ought to be determined with relation to the object of geometry i shall nevertheless for the fuller illustration thereof consider the case of an intelligence or unbodied spirit which is supposed to see perfectly well ie to have a clear perception of the proper and immediate objects of sight but to have no sense of touch whether there be any such being in nature or no is beside my purpose to inquire it sufficeth that the supposition contains no contradiction in it let us now examine what proficiency such a one may be able to make in geometry which speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the object of that science first then it is certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea of a solid or quantity of three dimensions which followeth from its not having any idea of distance we indeed are prone to think that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids which ariseth from our imagining that we do strictly speaking see distance and some parts of an object at a greater distance than others which hath been demonstrated to be the effect of the experience we have had what ideas of touch are connected with such and such ideas attending vision but the intelligence here spoken of is supposed to have no experience of touch he would not therefore judge as we do nor have any idea of distance outness or profundity nor consequently of space or body either immediately or by suggestion whence it is plain he can have no notion of those parts of geometry which relate to the mensuration of solids and their convex or concave surfaces and contemplate the properties of lines generated by the section of a solid the conceiving of any part whereof is beyond the reach of his faculties farther he cannot comprehend the manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle the rule and compass with their use being things of which it is impossible he should have any notion nor is it an easier matter for him to conceive the placing of one plane or angle on another in order to prove their equality since that supposeth some idea of distance or external space all which makes it evident our pure intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first elements of plane geometry and perhaps upon a nice inquiry it will be found he cannot even have an idea of plane figures any more than he can of solids since some idea of distance is necessary to form the idea of a geometrical plane as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it all that is properly perceived by the visive faculty amounts to no more than colours with their variations and different proportions of light and shade but the perpetual mutability and fleetingness of those immediate objects of sight render them incapable of being managed after the manner of geometrical figures nor is it in any degree useful that they should it is true there are divers of them perceived at once and more of some and less of others but accurately to compute their magnitude and assign precise determinate proportions between things so variable and inconstant if we suppose it possible to be done must yet be a very trifling and insignificant labour i must confess men are tempted to think that flat or plane figures are immediate objects of sight though they acknowledge solids are not and this opinion is grounded on what is observed in painting wherein it seems the ideas immediately imprinted on the mind are only of planes variously coloured which by a sudden act of the judgment are changed into solids but with a little attention we shall find the planes here mentioned as the immediate objects of sight are not visible but tangible planes for when we say that pictures are planes we mean thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform but then this smoothness and uniformity or in other words this planeness of the picture is not perceived immediately by vision for it appeareth to the eye various and multiform from all which we may conclude that planes are no more the immediate object of sight than solids what we strictly see are not solids nor yet planes variously coloured they are only diversity of colours and some of these suggest to the mind solids and other plane figures just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other so that we see planes in the same way that we see solids both being equally suggested by the immediate objects of sight which accordingly are themselves denominated planes and solids but though they are called by the same names with the things marked by them they are nevertheless of a nature entirely different as hath been demonstrated what hath been said is if i mistake not sufficient to decide the question we proposed to examine concerning the ability of a pure spirit such as we have described to know geometry it is indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an intelligence because we cannot without great pains cleverly separate and disentangle in our thoughts the proper objects of sight from those of touch which are connected with them this indeed in a complete degree seems scarce possible to be performed which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it is for anyone to hear the words of his native language pronounced in his ears without understanding them though he endeavour to disunite the meaning from the sound it will nevertheless intrude into his thoughts and he shall find it extreme difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the posture of a foreigner that never learned the language so as to be affected barely with the sounds themselves and not perceive the signification annexed to them by this time i suppose it is clear that neither abstract nor visible extension makes the object of geometry the not discerning of which may perhaps have created some difficulty and useless labour in mathematics sure i am that somewhat relating thereto has occurred to my thoughts which though after the most anxious and repeated examination i am forced to think it true doth nevertheless seem so far out of the common road of geometry that i know not whether it may not be thought presumption if i should make it public in an age wherein that science hath received such mighty improvements by new methods great part whereof as well as of the ancient discoveries may perhaps lose their reputation and much of that ardour with which men study the abstruse and fine geometry be abated if what to me and those few to whom i have imparted it seems evidently true should really prove to be sothree dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to sceptics and atheists george berkeley contents the first dialogue the second dialogue the third dialogue the first dialogue philonous good morning hylas i didnt expect to find you out and about so early hylas it is indeed somewhat unusual but my thoughts were so taken up with a subject i was talking about last night that i couldnt sleep so i decided to get up and walk in the garden thats good it gives you a chance to see what innocent and agreeable pleasures you lose every morning can there be a pleasanter time of the day or a more delightful season of the year that purple sky those wild but sweet notes of birds the fragrant bloom on the trees and flowers the gentle influence of the rising sun these and a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret raptures but im afraid i am interrupting your thoughts for you seemed very intent on something yes i was and id be grateful if you would allow me to carry on with it but i dont in the least want to deprive myself of your company for my thoughts always flow more easily in conversation with a friend than when i am alone please may i share with you the thoughts i have been having with all my heart it is what i would have requested myself if you hadnt asked first i was considering the odd fate of those men who have in all ages through a desire to mark themselves off from the common people or through heaven knows what trick of their thought claimed either to believe nothing at all or to believe the most extravagant things in the world this wouldnt matter so much if their paradoxes and scepticism didnt bring consequences that are bad for mankind in general but theres a risk that they will do that and that when men who are thought to have spent their whole time in the pursuit of knowledge claim to be entirely ignorant of everything or advocate views that are in conflict with plain and commonly accepted principles this will tempt other peoplewho have less leisure for this sort of thingto become suspicious of the most important truths ones they had previously thought to be sacred and unquestionable i entirely agree with you about the bad effects of the paraded doubts of some philosophers and the fantastical views of others i have felt this so strongly in recent times that i have dropped some of the highflown theories i had learned in their universities replacing them with ordinary common opinions since this revolt of mine against metaphysical notions and in favour of the plain dictates of nature and common sense i swear that i find i can think ever so much better so that i can now easily understand many things which previously were mysteries and riddles i am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts i heard of you what if you please were they in last nights conversation you were represented as someone who maintains the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind of man namely that there is no such thing as material substance in the world i seriously believe that there is no such thing as what philosophers call material substance but if i were made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this then i would have the same reason to renounce this belief as i think i have now to reject the contrary opinion what can anything be more fantastical more in conflict with common sense or a more obvious piece of scepticism than to believe there is no such thing as matter steady on hylas what if it were to turn out that you who hold that there is matter areby virtue of that opiniona greater sceptic and maintain more paradoxes and conflicts with common sense than i who believe no such thing you have as good a chance of convincing me that the part is greater than the whole as of convincing me that i must give up my belief in matter if i am to avoid absurdity and scepticism well then are you content to accept as true any opinion that turns out to be the most agreeable to common sense and most remote from scepticism with all my heart since you want to start arguments about the plainest things in the world i am content for once to hear what you have to say tell me please hylas what do you mean by a sceptic i mean what everyone means someone who doubts everything so if someone has no doubts concerning some particular point then with regard to that point he cannot be thought a sceptic i agree with you does doubting consist in accepting the affirmative or the negative side of a question neither anyone who understands english must know that doubting signifies a suspense between the two sides so if someone denies any point he can no more be said to doubt concerning it than he who affirms it with the same degree of assurance true and so his denial no more makes him a sceptic than the other is i acknowledge it then how does it happen hylas that you call me a sceptic because i deny what you affirm namely the existence of matter for all you know i may be as firmly convinced in my denial as you are in your affirmation hold on a moment philonous my definition of sceptic was wrong but you cant hold a man to every false step he makes in conversation i did say that a sceptic is someone who doubts everything but i should have added or who denies the reality and truth of things what things do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences but these you know are universal intellectual notions and have nothing to do with matter so that the denial of matter doesnt imply the denial of them i agree about that but what about other things what do you think about distrusting the senses denying the real existence of sensible things or claiming to know nothing of them isnt that enough to qualify a man as a sceptic throughout the dialogues sensible means capable of being sensedthat is visible or audible or tangible etc well then let us see which of us it is that denies the reality of sensible things or claims to have the greatest ignorance of them since if i understand you rightly he is to be counted the greater sceptic that is what i desire what do you mean by sensible things things that are perceived by the senses can you imagine that i mean anything else im sorry but it may greatly shorten our enquiry if i have a clear grasp of your notions bear with me then while i ask you this further question are things perceived by the senses only the ones that are perceived immediately or do they include things that are perceived mediately that is through the intervention of something else i dont properly understand you in reading a book what i immediately perceive are the letters on the page but mediately or by means of these the notions of god virtue truth etc are suggested to my mind now theres no doubt that the letters are truly sensible things or things perceived by sense but i want to know whether you take the things suggested by them to be perceived by sense too no certainly it would be absurd to think that god or virtue are sensible things though they may be signified and suggested to the mind by sensible marks with which they have an arbitrary connection it seems then that by sensible things you mean only those that can be perceived immediately by sense right doesnt it follow from this that when i see one part of the sky red and another blue and i infer from this that there must be some cause for that difference of colours that cause cannot be said to be a sensible thing or perceived by eyesight it does similarly when i hear a variety of sounds i cannot be said to hear their causes you cannot and when by touch i feel a thing to be hot and heavy i cant say with any truth or correctness that i feel the cause of its heat or weight to head off any more questions of this kind i tell you once and for all that by sensible things i mean only things that are perceived by sense and that the senses perceive only what they perceive immediately because they dont make inferences so the deducing of causes or occasions from effects and appearances which are the only things we perceive by sense is entirely the business of reason in this context occasion can be taken as equivalent to cause the two terms are separated in the second dialogue at page we agree then that sensible things include only things that are immediately perceived by sense now tell me whether we immediately perceive by sight anything besides light colours and shapes by hearing anything but sounds by the palate anything besides tastes by the sense of smell anything besides odours by touch anything more than tangible qualities we do not so it seems that if you take away all sensible qualities there is nothing left that is sensible i agree sensible things then are nothing but so many sensible qualities or combinations of sensible qualities nothing else so heat is a sensible thing certainly does the reality of sensible things consist in being perceived or is it something different from their being perceivedsomething that doesnt involve the mind to exist is one thing and to be perceived is another i am talking only about sensible things my question is by the real existence of one of them do you mean an existence exterior to the mind and distinct from their being perceived i mean a real absolute existencedistinct from and having no relation to their being perceived so if heat is granted to have a real existence it must exist outside the mind it must tell me hylas is this real existence equally possible for all degrees of heat that we feel or is there a reason why we should attribute it to some degrees of heat and not to others if there is please tell me what it is whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense we can be sure exists also in the object that occasions it what the greatest as well as the least yes because the same reason holds for both they are both perceived by sense indeed the greater degree of heat is more intensely sensibly perceived so if there is any difference it is that we are more certain of the real existence of a greater heat than we can be of the reality of a lesser but isnt the most fierce and intense degree of heat a very great pain noone can deny that and can any unperceiving thing have pain or pleasure certainly not is your material substance a senseless thing or does it have sense and perception it is senseless without doubt so it cant be the subject of pain indeed it cant nor consequently can it be the subject of the greatest heat perceived by sense since you agree that this is a considerable pain i accept that then what are we to say about your external object is it a material substance or is it not it is a material substance with the sensible qualities inhering in it but then how can a great heat exist in it since you agree it cannot exist in a material substance please clear up this point hold on philonous im afraid i went wrong in granting that intense heat is a pain i should have said not that the pain is the heat but that it is the consequence or effect of the heat when you put your hand near the fire do you feel one simple uniform sensation or two distinct sensations just one simple sensation isnt the heat immediately perceived it is and the pain true well then seeing that they are both immediately perceived at the same time and that the fire affects you with only one simple or uncompounded idea one idea without parts it follows that this one simple idea is both the immediately perceived intense heat and the pain and consequently that the immediately perceived intense heat is identical with a particular sort of pain it seems so consult your thoughts again hylas can you conceive an intense sensation to occur without pain or pleasure i cannot or can you form an idea of sensible pain or pleasure in general abstracted from every particular idea of heat cold tastes smells etc i dont find that i can then doesnt it follow that sensible pain is nothing but intense degrees of those sensations or ideas that is undeniable in fact im starting to suspect that a very great heat cant exist except in a mind perceiving it what are you then in that sceptical state of suspense between affirming and denying i think i can be definite about it a very violent and painful heat cant exist outside the mind so according to you it has no real existence i admit it is it certain then that no body in nature is really hot i havent said that there is no real heat in bodies i only say that theres no such thing as an intense real heat in bodies but didnt you say earlier that all degrees of heat are equally real or that if there is any difference the greater heat is more certainly real than the lesser yes i did but that was because i had overlooked the reason there is for distinguishing between them which i now plainly see it is this because intense heat is nothing but a particular kind of painful sensation and pain cant exist except in a perceiving being it follows that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal bodily substance but thats no reason for denying that less intense heat can exist in such a substance but how are we to draw the line separating degrees of heat that exist only in the mind from ones that exist outside it that isnt hard the slightest pain cant exist unperceived as you know so any degree of heat that is a pain exists only in the mind we dont have to think the same for degrees of heat that are not pains i think you agreed a while back that no unperceiving being is capable of pleasure any more than it is of pain i did well isnt warmtha milder degree of heat than what causes discomfort or worsea pleasure what of it it follows that warmth cant exist outside the mind in any unperceiving substance or body so it seems so we have reached the position that degrees of heat that arent painful and also ones that are can exist only in a thinking substance cant we conclude from this that external bodies are absolutely incapable of any degree of heat whatsoever on second thoughts i am less sure that warmth is a pleasure than i am that intense heat is a pain i dont claim that warmth is as great a pleasure as heat is a pain but if you admit it to be even a small pleasure that is enough to yield my conclusion i could rather call it absence of pain it seems to be merely the lack of pain and of pleasure i hope you wont deny that this quality or state is one that an unthinking substance can have if you are determined to maintain that warmth is not a pleasure i dont know how to convince you otherwise except by appealing to your own experience but what do you think about cold the same as i do about heat an intense degree of cold is a pain for to feel a very great cold is to experience a great discomfort so it cant exist outside the mind but a lesser degree of cold can exist outside the mind as well as a lesser degree of heat so when we feel a moderate degree of heat or cold from a body that is applied to our skin we must conclude that that body has a moderate degree of heat or cold in it we must can any doctrine be true if it necessarily leads to absurdity certainly not isnt it an absurdity to think that a single thing should be at the same time both cold and warm it is well now suppose that one of your hands is hot and the other cold and that they are both at once plunged into a bowl of water that has a temperature between the two wont the water seem cold to one hand and warm to the other it will then doesnt it follow by your principles that the water really is both cold and warm at the same timethus believing something that you agree to be an absurdity i admit that that seems right so the principles themselves are false since you have admitted that no true principle leads to an absurdity but after all can anything be more absurd than to say that there is no heat in the fire to make the point still clearer answer me this in two cases that are exactly alike oughtnt we to make the same judgment we ought when a pin pricks your finger doesnt it tear and divide the fibres of your flesh it does and when hot coal burns your finger does it do any more it does not you hold that the pin itself doesnt contain either the sensation that it causes or anything like it so given what you have just agreed tonamely that like cases should be judged alikeyou ought to hold that the fire doesnt contain either the sensation that it causes or anything like it well since it must be so i am content to give up this point and admit that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our minds still there are plenty of other qualities through which to secure the reality of external things but what will you say hylas if it turns out that the same argument applies with regard to all other sensible qualities and that none of them can be supposed to exist outside the mind any more than heat and cold can proving that would be quite a feat but i see no chance of your doing so let us examine the other sensible qualities in order what about tastes do you think they exist outside the mind or not can anyone in his right mind doubt that sugar is sweet or that wormwood is bitter tell me hylas is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation or is it not it is and isnt bitterness some kind of discomfort or pain i grant that if therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal substances existing outside the mind how can sweetness and bitternessthat is pleasure and painbe in them hold on philonous now i see what has deluded me all this time you asked whether heat and cold sweetness and bitterness are particular sorts of pleasure and pain to which i answered simply that they are i should have answered by making a distinction those qualities as perceived by us are pleasures or pains but as existing in the external objects they are not so we cannot conclude without qualification that there is no heat in the fire or sweetness in the sugar but only that heat or sweetness as perceived by us are not in the fire or the sugar what do you say to this i say it is irrelevant we were talking only about sensible things which you defined as things we immediately perceive by our senses whatever other qualities you are talking about have no place in our conversation and i dont know anything about them you may indeed claim to have discovered certain qualities that you dont perceive and assert that they exist in fire and sugar but i cant for the life of me see how that serves your side in the argument we were having tell me then once more do you agree that heat and cold sweetness and bitterness meaning the qualities that are perceived by the senses dont exist outside the mind i see it is no use holding out so i give up the cause with respect to those four qualities though i must say it sounds odd to say that sugar isnt sweet it might sound better to you if you bear this in mind someone whose palate is diseased may experience as bitter stuff that at other times seems sweet to him and its perfectly obvious that different people perceive different tastes in the same food since what one man delights in another loathes how could this be if the taste were really inherent in the food i admit that i dont know how now think about odours dont they exactly fit what i have just been saying about tastes arent they just so many pleasing or displeasing sensations they are then can you conceive it to be possible that they should exist in an unperceiving thing i cannot or can you imagine that filth and excrement affect animals that choose to feed on them with the same smells that we perceive in them by no means then cant we conclude that smells like the other qualities we have been discussing cannot exist anywhere but in a perceiving substance or mind i think so what about sounds are they qualities really inherent in external bodies or not they dont inhere in the sounding bodies we know this because when a bell is struck in a vacuum it sends out no sound so the subject of sound must be the air explain that hylas when the air is set into motion we perceive a louder or softer sound in proportion to the airs motion but when the air is still we hear no sound at all granting that we never hear a sound except when some motion is produced in the air i still dont see how you can infer from this that the sound itself is in the air this motion in the external air is what produces in the mind the sensation of sound by striking on the eardrum it causes a vibration which is passed along the auditory nerves to the brain whereon the mind experiences the sensation called sound what is sound a sensation as i said as perceived by us it is a particular sensation in the mind and can any sensation exist outside the mind no certainly but if sound is a sensation how can it exist in the air if by the air you mean a senseless substance existing outside the mind philonous you must distinguish sound as it is perceived by us from sound as it is in itself orin other wordsdistinguish the sound we immediately perceive from the sound that exists outside us the former is indeed a particular kind of sensation but the latter is merely a vibration in the air i thought i had already flattened that distinction by the answer i gave when you were applying it in a similar case before but ill let that pass are you sure then that sound is really nothing but motion i am whatever is true of real sound therefore can truthfully be said of motion it may so it makes sense to speak of motion as something that is loud sweet piercing or lowpitched i see you are determined not to understand me isnt it obvious that those qualities belong only to sensible sound or sound in the ordinary everyday meaning of the word but not to sound in the real and scientific sense which as i have just explained is nothing but a certain motion of the air it seems then there are two sorts of soundthe common everyday sort that we hear and the scientific and real sort that we dont hear just so and the latter kind of sound consists in motion as i told you tell me hylas which of the senses do you think the idea of motion belongs to the sense of hearing certainly not to the senses of sight and touch it should follow then according to you that real sounds may possibly be seen or felt but can never be heard look philonous make fun of my views if you want to but that wont alter the truth of things i admit that the inferences you draw from them sound a little odd but ordinary language is formed by ordinary people for their own use so its not surprising if statements that express exact scientific notions seem clumsy and strange is it come to that i assure you i think i have scored a pretty big win when you so casually depart from ordinary phrases and opinions because what we were mainly arguing about was whose notions are furthest from the common road and most in conflict with what people in general think your claim that real sounds are never heard and that we get our idea of sound through some other sensecan you think that this is merely an oddsounding scientific truth isnt something in it contrary to nature and the truth of things frankly i dont like it either given the concessions i have already made i had better admit that sounds also have no real existence outside the mind and i hope you wont stick at admitting the same of colours pardon me the case of colours is very different can anything be more obvious than the fact that we see colours on the objects the objects you speak of are i suppose corporeal substances existing outside the mind they are and they have true and real colours inhering in them each visible object has the colour that we see in it hah is there anything visible other than what we perceive by sight there is not and do we perceive anything by our senses that we dont perceive immediately how often do i have to say it i tell you we do not bear with me hylas and tell me yet again whether anything is immediately perceived by the senses other than sensible qualities i know you asserted that nothing is but i want to know now whether you still think so i do now is your corporeal substance either a sensible quality or made up of sensible qualities what a question to ask who ever thought it was here is why i ask when you say that each visible object has the colour that we see in it you imply that either visible objects are sensible qualities or else something other than sensible qualities can be perceived by sight but we earlier agreed that is false and you still think it is so we are left with the thesis that visible objects are sensible qualities now in this conversation you have been taking it that visible objects are corporeal substances and so we reach the conclusion that your corporeal substances are nothing but sensible qualities you may draw as many absurd consequences as you please and try to entangle the plainest things but you will never persuade me out of my senses i clearly understand my own meaning i wish you would make me understand it too but since you dont want me to look into your notion of corporeal substance i shall drop that point but please tell me whether the colours that we see are the very ones that exist in external bodies or some other colours they are the very same ones oh then are the beautiful red and purple that we see on those clouds over there really in them or do you rather think that the clouds in themselves are nothing but a dark mist or vapour i must admit philonous that those colours arent really in the clouds as they seem to be at this distance they are only apparent colours apparent call you them how are we to distinguish these apparent colours from real ones very easily when a colour appears only at a distance and vanishes when one comes closer it is merely apparent and i suppose that real colours are ones that are revealed by looking carefully from close up right does the closest and most careful way of looking use a microscope or only the naked eye a microscope of course but a microscope often reveals colours in an object different from those perceived by unassisted sight and if we had microscopes that could magnify to as much as we liked it is certain that no object whatsoever when seen through them would appear with the same colour that it presents to the naked eye well what do you conclude from that you cant argue that there are really and naturally no colours on objects just because we can contrive artificial ways to alter them or make them vanish it can obviously be inferred from your own concessions i think that all the colours we see with our naked eyes are only apparentlike those on the cloudssince they vanish when one looks more closely and accurately as one can with a microscope and to anticipate your next objection i ask you whether the real and natural state of an object is revealed better by a very sharp and piercing sight or by one that is less sharp by the former without doubt isnt it plain from the science of optics that microscopes make the sight more penetrating and represent objects as they would appear to the eye if it were naturally endowed with extreme sharpness it is so the microscopic representation of a thing should be regarded as the one that best displays the things real nature or what the thing is in itself so the colours perceived through a microscope are more genuine and real than those perceived in any other way i admit that theres something in what you say besides its not only possible but clearly true that there actually are animals whose eyes are naturally formed to perceive things that are too small for us to see what do you think about those inconceivably small animals that we perceive through microscopes must we suppose they are all totally blind if they can see dont we have to suppose that their sight has the same use in preserving their bodies from injuries as eyesight does in all other animals if it does have that use isnt it obvious that they must see particles that are smaller than their own bodies which will present them with a vastly different view of each object from the view that strikes our senses even our own eyes dont always represent objects to us in the same way everyone knows that to someone suffering from jaundice all things seem yellow so isnt it highly probable that animals whose eyes we see to be differently structured from ours and whose bodily fluids are unlike ours dont see the same colours as we do in every object from all of this shouldnt it seem to follow that all colours are equally apparent and that none of the ones that we see are really in any outer object it should to put it past all doubt consider the following if colours were real properties or qualities inhering in external bodies they couldnt be altered except by some alteration in the very bodies themselves but isnt it evident that the colours of an object can be changed or made to disappear entirely through the use of a microscope or some change in the fluids in the eye or a change in the viewing distance without any sort of real alteration in the thing itself indeed even when all the other factors remain unaltered some objects present different colours to the eye depending on the angle from which they are looked at the same thing happens when we view an object in different brightnesses of light and everyone knows that the same bodies appear differently coloured by candlelight from what they do in daylight add to these facts our experience of a prism which separates the different rays of light and thereby alters the colour of an object causing the whitest object to appear deep blue or red to the naked eye now tell me whether you still think that each body has its true real colour inhering in it if you think it has i want to know what particular distance and orientation of the object what special condition of the eye what intensity or kind of light is needed for discovering that true colour and distinguishing it from the apparent ones i admit to being quite convinced that they are all equally apparent that no such thing as colour really inheres in external bodies and that colour is wholly in the light what confirms me in this opinion is the fact that colours are more or less vivid depending on the brightness of the light and that when there is no light no colours are seen furthermore if there were colours in external objects how could we possibly perceive them no external body affects the mind unless it acts first on our senseorgans and the only action of bodies is motion and this cant be communicated except in collisions so a distant object cant act on the eye and so cant enable itself or its properties to be perceived by the mind from this it plainly follows that what immediately causes the perception of colours is some substance that is in contact with the eyesuch as light what is light a substance i tell you philonous external light is simply a thin fluid substance whose tiny particles when agitated with a brisk motion and in various ways reflected to the eyes from the different surfaces of outer objects cause different motions in the optic nerves these motions are passed along to the brain where they cause various states and events and these are accompanied by the sensations of red blue yellow etc it seems then that all the light does is to shake the optic nerves that is all and as a result of each particular motion of the nerves the mind is affected with a sensation which is some particular colour right and these sensations have no existence outside the mind they have not then how can you say that colours are in the light since you take light to be a corporeal substance external to the mind light and colours as immediately perceived by us cannot exist outside the mind i admit that but in themselves they are only the motions and arrangements of certain insensible particles of matter colours then in the ordinary sensethat is understood to be the immediate objects of sightcannot be had by any substance that doesnt perceive that is what i say well then you give up your position as regards those sensible qualities which are what all mankind takes to be colours think what you like about the scientists invisible colours it is not my business to argue about them but i suggest that you consider whether it is wise for you in a discussion like this one to affirm that the red and blue we see are not real colours and that certain unknown motions and shapes which no man ever did or could see are real colours arent these shocking notions and arent they open to as many ridiculous inferences as those you had to give up in the case of sounds i have to admit philonous that i cant keep this up any longer colours sounds tastesin a word all that are termed secondary qualitieshave no existence outside the mind but in granting this i dont take anything away from the reality of matter or external objects because various philosophers maintain what i just did about secondary qualities and yet are the far from denying matter in this context philosophers means philosophers and scientists to make this clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities into primary and secondary primary qualities are extendedness shape solidity gravity motion and rest they hold that these really exist in bodies secondary qualities are all the sensible qualities that arent primary and the philosophers assert that these are merely sensations or ideas existing nowhere but in the mind no doubt you are already aware of all this for my part i have long known that such an opinion was current among philosophers but i was never thoroughly convinced of its truth till now so you still believe that extension and shapes are inherent in external unthinking substances here extension could mean extendedness or it could mean size i do but what if the arguments that are brought against secondary qualities hold against these also why then i shall have to think that shape and extension also exist only in the mind is it your opinion that the very shape and extension that you perceive by sense exist in the outer object or material substance it is have all other animals as good reason as you do to think that the shape and extension that they see and feel is in the outer object surely they do if they can think at all tell me hylas do you think that the senses were given to all animals for their preservation and wellbeing in life or were they given only to men for that end i dont doubt that they have the same use in all other animals if so mustnt their senses enable them to perceive their own limbs and to perceive bodies that are capable of harming them certainly a tiny insect therefore must be supposed to see its own foot and other things of that size or even smaller seeing them all as bodies of considerable size even though you can see themif at allonly as so many visible points i cant deny that and to creatures even smaller than that insect they will seem even bigger they will so that something you can hardly pick out because it is so small will appear like a huge mountain to an extremely tiny animal i agree about all this can a single thing have different sizes at the same time it would be absurd to think so but from what you have said it follows that the true size of the insects foot is the size you see it having and the size the insect sees it as having and all the sizes it is seen as having by animals that are even smaller that is to say your own principles have led you into an absurdity i seem to be in some difficulty about this another point didnt you agree that no real inherent property of any object can be changed unless the thing itself alters i did but as we move towards or away from an object its visible size varies being at one distance ten or a hundred times greater than at another doesnt it follow from this too that size isnt really inherent in the object i admit that i dont know what to think you will soon be able to make up your mind if you will venture to think as freely about this quality as you have about the others didnt you admit that it was legitimate to infer that neither heat nor cold was in the water from the premise that the water seemed warm to one hand and cold to the other i did isnt it the very same reasoning to infer that there is no size or shape in an object from the premise that to one eye it seems little smooth and round while to the other eye it appears big uneven and angular the very same but does the latter ever happen you can at any time find out that it does by looking with one eye bare and with the other through a microscope i dont know how to maintain it yet i am reluctant to give up extension size because i see so many odd consequences following from the concession that extension isnt in the outer object odd you say after the things you have already agreed to i hope you wont be put off from anything just because it is odd but in any case wouldnt it seem very odd if the general reasoning that covers all the other sensible qualities didnt apply also to extension if you agree that no idea or anything like an idea can exist in an unperceiving substance then surely it follows that no shape or mode of extension or specific way of being extended that we can have any idea ofin perceiving or imaginingcan be really inherent in matter whether the sensible quality is shape or sound or colour or what you will it seems impossible that any of these should subsist in something that doesnt perceive it not to mention the peculiar difficulty there must be in conceiving a material substance prior to and distinct from extension to be the substratum of extension ill say more about that shortly i give up on this point for just now but i reserve the right to retract my opinion if i later discover that i was led to it by a false step that is a right you cant be denied shapes and extendedness being disposed of we proceed next to motion can a real motion in any external body be at the same time both very swift and very slow it cannot isnt the speed at which a body moves inversely proportional to the time it takes to go any given distance thus a body that travels a mile in an hour moves three times as fast as it would if it travelled only a mile in three hours i agree with you and isnt time measured by the succession of ideas in our minds it is and isnt it possible that ideas should succeed one another twice as fast in your mind as they do in mine or in the mind of some kind of nonhuman spirit i agree about that consequently the same body may seem to another spirit to make its journey in half the time that it seems to you to take half is just an example any other fraction would make the point just as well that is to say according to your view that both of the perceived motions are in the object a single body can really move both very swiftly and very slowly at the same time how is this consistent either with common sense or with what you recently agreed to i have nothing to say to it now for solidity if you dont use solidity to name any sensible quality then it is irrelevant to our enquiry if you do use it to name a sensible quality the quality must be either hardness or resistance but each of these is plainly relative to our senses it is obvious that what seems hard to one animal may appear soft to another that has greater force and firmness of limbs and it is equally obvious that the resistance i feel when i press against a body is not in the body i agree that the sensation of resistance which is all you immediately perceive is not in the body but the cause of that sensation is but the causes of our sensations arent immediately perceived and therefore arent sensible i thought we had settled this point i admit that we did excuse me if i seem a little embarrassed i am having trouble quitting my earlier views it may be a help for you to consider this point once extendedness is admitted to have no existence outside the mind the same must be granted for motion solidity and gravity since obviously they all presuppose extendedness so it is superfluous to enquire into each of them separately in denying extendedness you have denied them all to have any real existence if this is right philonous i wonder why the philosophers who deny the secondary qualities any real existence should yet attribute it to the primary qualities if theres no difference between them how can this be accounted for it isnt my business to account for every opinion of the philosophers but there are many possible explanations one of them being that those philosophers were influenced by the fact that pleasure and pain are associated with the secondary qualities rather than with the primary ones heat and cold tastes and smells have something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than what we get from the ideas of extendedness shape and motion and since it is too visibly absurd to hold that pain or pleasure can be in an unperceiving substance men have more easily been weaned from believing in the external existence of the secondary qualities than of the primary ones you will see that there is something in this if you recall the distinction you made between moderate heat and intense heat allowing one a real existence outside the mind while denying it to the other but after all there is no rational basis for that distinction for surely a sensation that is neither pleasing nor painful is just as much a sensation as one that is pleasing or painful so neither kind should be supposed to exist in an unthinking subject it has just come into my head philonous that i have somewhere heard of a distinction between absolute and sensible extendedness granted that large and small consist merely in the relation other extended things have to the parts of our own bodies and so arent really in the substances themselves still we dont have to say the same about absolute extendedness which is something abstracted from large and small from this or that particular size and shape similarly with motion fast and slow are altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own minds but just because those special cases of motion do not exist outside the mind it doesnt follow that the same is true of the absolute motion that is abstracted from them what distinguishes one instance of motion or of extendedness from another isnt it something sensiblefor instance some speed or some size and shape i think so so these qualitiesnamely absolute motion and absolute extendednesswhich are stripped of all sensible properties have no features making them more specific in any way that is right that is to say they are extendedness in general and motion in general if you say so but everyone accepts the maxim that every thing that exists is particular how then can motion in general or extendedness in general exist in any corporeal substance i will need time to think about that i think the point can be speedily decided without doubt you can tell whether you are able to form this or that idea in your mind now im willing to let our present dispute be settled in the following way if you can form in your thoughts a distinct abstract idea of motion or extendedness having none of those sensible qualitiesswift and slow large and small round and square and the likewhich we agree exist only in the mind then ill capitulate but if you cant it will be unreasonable for you to insist any longer on something of which you have no notion to be frank i cannot can you even separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from the ideas of all the socalled secondary qualities what isnt it easy to consider extendedness and motion by themselves abstracted from all other sensible qualities isnt that how the mathematicians handle them i acknowledge hylas that it is not difficult to form general propositions and reasonings about extendedness and motion without mentioning any other qualities and in that sense to treat them abstractedly i can pronounce the word motion by itself but how does it follow from this that i can form in my mind the idea of motion without an idea of body theorems about extension and shapes can be proved without any mention of large or small or any other sensible quality but how does it follow from this that the mind can form and grasp an abstract idea of extension without any particular size or shape or other sensible quality mathematicians study quantity disregarding any other sensible qualities that go with it on the grounds that they are irrelevant to the proofs but when they lay aside the words and contemplate the bare ideas i think youll find that they arent the pure abstracted ideas of extendedness but what do you say about pure intellect cant abstracted ideas be formed by that faculty since i cant form abstract ideas at all it is clearly impossible for me to form them with help from pure intellect whatever faculty you mean that phrase to refer to setting aside questions about the nature of pure intellect and its spiritual objects such as virtue reason god etc i can say this much that seems clearly true sensible things can only be perceived by the senses or represented by the imagination so shape and size dont belong to pure intellect because they are initially perceived through the senses if you want to be surer about this try and see if you can frame the idea of any shape abstracted from all particularities of size and from other sensible qualities let me think a littlei dont find that i can well can you think it possible that something might really exist in nature when it implies a contradiction in its conception by no means therefore since even the mind cant possibly separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from all other sensible qualities doesnt it follow that where the former exist the latter must also exist it would seem so consequently the very same arguments that you agreed to be decisive against the secondary qualities need no extra help to count just as strongly against the primary qualities also besides if you trust your senses dont they convince you that all sensible qualities coexist that is that they all appear to the senses as being in the same place do your senses ever represent a motion or shape as being divested of all other visible and tangible qualities you neednt say any more about this i freely admit unless there has been some hidden error or oversight in our discussion up to herethat all sensible qualities should alike be denied existence outside the mind but i fear that i may have been too free in my former concessions or overlooked some fallacy in your line of argument in short i didnt take time to think as to that hylas take all the time you want to go back over our discussion you are at liberty to repair any slips you have made or to support your initial opinion by presenting arguments that you have so far overlooked i think it was a big oversight on my part that i failed to distinguish sufficiently the object from the sensation the sensation cannot exist outside the mind but it doesnt follow that the object cannot either what object do you mean the object of the senses exactly so it is immediately perceived right explain to me the difference between what is immediately perceived and a sensation i take the sensation to be an act of the perceiving mind beside which there is something perceived which i call the object of the act for example there is red and yellow on that tulip but the act of perceiving those colours is in me only and not in the tulip what tulip are you talking about is it the one that you see the same and what do you see beside colour shape and extendedness nothing so you would say that the red and yellow are coexistent with the extension wouldnt you yes and i go further i say that they have a real existence outside the mind in some unthinking substance that the colours are really in the tulip which i see is obvious nor can it be denied that this tulip may exist independently of your mind or mine but that any immediate object of the sensesthat is any idea or combination of ideasshould exist in an unthinking substance or exterior to all minds is in itself an obvious contradiction nor can i imagine how it follows from what you said just now namely that the red and yellow are in the tulip you saw since you dont claim to see that unthinking substance you are skillful at changing the subject philonous i see that you dont want me to push on in that direction so lets return to your distinction between sensation and object if i understand you correctly you hold that in every perception there are two things of which one is an action of the mind and the other is not true and this action cant exist in or belong to any unthinking thing but whatever else is involved in a perception may do so that is my position so that if there were a perception without any act of the mind that perception could exist in an unthinking substance i grant that but it is impossible that there should be such a perception when is the mind said to be active when it produces puts an end to or changes anything can the mind produce discontinue or change anything in any way except by an act of the will it cannot so the mind is to count as being active in its perceptions to the extent that volition is included in them it is when i pluck this flower i am active because i do it by a handmovement which arose from my volition so likewise in holding it up to my nose but is either of these smelling no i also act when i draw air through my nose because my breathing in that manner rather than otherwise is an effect of my volition but this isnt smelling either for if it were i would smell every time i breathed in that manner true smelling then is a result of all this plucking holding up and breathing in it is but i dont find that my will is involved any further that is in anything other than the plucking holding up and breathing in whatever else happensincluding my perceiving a smellis independent of my will and i am wholly passive with respect to it is it different in your case hylas no its just the same now consider seeing isnt it in your power to open your eyes or keep them shut to turn them this way or that without doubt but does it similarly depend on your will that when you look at this flower you perceive white rather than some other colour when you direct your open eyes towards that part of the sky can you avoid seeing the sun or is light or darkness the effect of your volition no certainly in these respects then you are altogether passive i am tell me now does seeing consist in perceiving light and colours or rather in opening and turning the eyes the former certainly well then since in the actual perception of light and colours you are altogether passive what has become of that action that you said was an ingredient in every sensation and doesnt it follow from your own concessions that the perception of light and colourswhich doesnt involve any actioncan exist in an unperceiving substance and isnt this a plain contradiction i dont know what to think furthermore since you distinguish active and passive elements in every perception you must do it in the perception of pain but how could painhowever inactive it ispossibly exist in an unperceiving substance think about it and then tell me frankly arent light and colours tastes sounds etc all equally passions or sensations in the mind you may call them external objects and give them in words whatever kind of existence you like but examine your own thoughts and then tell me whether i am not right i admit philonous that when i look carefully at what goes on in my mind all i can find is that i am a thinking being that has a variety of sensations and i cant conceive how a sensation could exist in an unperceiving substance but when on the other hand i look in a different way at sensible things considering them as so many properties and qualities i find that i have to suppose a material substratum without which they cant be conceived to exist material substratum you call it tell me please which of your senses acquainted you with it it is not itself sensible only its properties and qualities are perceived by the senses i presume then that you obtained the idea of it through reflection and reason i dont claim to have any proper positive idea of it here positive means nonrelational hylas means that he doesnt have an idea that represents what material substance is like in itself but i conclude that it exists because qualities cant be conceived to exist without a support so it seems that you have only a relative notion of material substance you conceive it only by conceiving how it relates to sensible qualities right tell me please what that relation is isnt it sufficiently expressed in the term substratum or substance one is latin and means underneath layer the other comes from latin meaning standing under if so the word substratum should mean that it is spread under the sensible qualities true and consequently spread under extendedness i agree so in its own nature it is entirely distinct from extendedness i tell you extendedness is only a quality and matter is something that supports qualities and isnt it obvious that the supported thing is different from the supporting one so something distinct from extendedness and not including it is supposed to be the substratum of extendedness just so tell me hylas can a thing be spread without being extended isnt the idea of extendedness necessarily included in that of spreading it is so anything that you suppose to be spread under something else must have in itself an extendedness distinct from the extendedness of the thing under which it is spread it must consequently every bodily substance being the substratum of extendedness must have in itself another extendedness which qualifies it to be a substratum and that extendedness must also have something spread under it a subsubstratum so to speak and so on to infinity isnt this absurd in itself as well as conflicting with what you have just said namely that the substratum was something distinct from extendedness and not including it yes but philonous you misunderstand me i dont mean that matter is spread in a crude literal sense under extension the word substratum is used only to express in general the same thing as substance well then let us examine the relation implied in the term substance is it not the relation of standing under qualities the very same but doesnt a thing have to be extended if it is to stand under or support another yes so isnt this supposition infected with the same absurdity as the previous one you still take things in a strict literal sense that isnt fair philonous i dont want to force any meaning onto your words you are free to explain them as you please but please make me understand something by them you tell me that matter supports or stands under accidents how as your legs support your body no that is the literal sense please let me know any sense literal or not literal that you understand it inhow long must i wait for an answer hylas i dont know what to say i once thought i understood well enough what was meant by matters supporting qualities but now the more i think about it the less i understand it in short i find that i dont know anything about it so it seems that you have no idea at all either positive or relative of matter you dont know what it is in itself or what relation it has to qualities i admit it and yet you said that you couldnt conceive the real existence of qualities without conceiving at the same time a material support for them i did that amounted to saying that when you conceive the real existence of qualities you also conceive something that you cant conceive it was wrong i admit but still i fear there is some fallacy or other let me try this it has just occurred to me that we were both led into error by your treating each quality by itself i grant that no quality can exist on its own outside the mind colour cant exist without extension nor can shape exist without some other sensible quality but as a number of qualities united or blended together constitute an entire sensible thing there is no obstacle to supposing that such thingsthat is such collections of qualitiescan exist outside the mind are you joking hylas or do you have a very bad memory we did indeed go through all the qualities by name one after another but my argumentsor rather your concessionsnowhere tended to prove that the secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind in isolation the point was rather that secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind at all its true that existinginisolation did come up in our discussion in discussing shape and motion we concluded they couldnt exist outside the mind because it was impossible even in thought to separate them from all secondary qualities so as to conceive them existing by themselves but this wasnt the only argument i used on that occasion however if you like we can set aside our whole conversation up to here counting it as nothing i am willing to let our whole debate be settled as follows if you can conceive it to be possible for any mixture or combination of qualities or any sensible object whatever to exist outside the mind then i will grant it actually to be so by that test the point will soon be decided what is easier than to conceive a tree or house existing by itself independently of and unperceived by any mind whatsoever i conceive them existing in that way right now tell me hylas can you see a thing which is at the same time unseen no that would be a contradiction is it not as great a contradiction to talk of conceiving a thing which is unconceived it is the tree or house therefore which you think of is conceived by you how could it be otherwise and what is conceived is surely in the mind without question what is conceived is in the mind then what led you to say that you conceived a house or tree existing independently and out of all minds whatsoever that was an oversight i admit but give me a moment to think about what led me into it it wasi now realize after reflectionan amusing mistake as i was thinking of a tree in a solitary place with nobody there to see it i thought that was conceiving a tree as existing unperceived or unthought of overlooking the fact i myself conceived it all the while but now i plainly see that all i can do is to form ideas in my own mind i can conceive in my own thoughts the idea of a tree or a house or a mountain but that is all and this is far from proving that i can conceive them existing out of the minds of all spirits you agree then that you cant conceive how any corporeal sensible thing should exist otherwise than in a mind i do and yet you will earnestly contend for the truth of something that you cant even conceive i admit that i dont know what to think but i still have doubts isnt it certain that i see things at a distance dont we perceive the stars and moon for example to be a long way away isnt this i say obvious to the senses dont you in dreams also perceive objects like those i do and dont they then appear in the same way to be distant they do but do you conclude that the apparitions in a dream are outside the mind by no means then you ought not to conclude that sensible objects seen when you are awake are outside the mind from their appearance or the manner in which you perceive them i admit that but doesnt my visual sense deceive me in those cases by telling me that sensible objects are at a distance when really they are not by no means neither eyesight nor reason inform you that the idea or thing that you immediately perceive actually exists outside the mind by eyesight you know only that you are affected with certain sensations of light and colours etc and you wont say that these are outside the mind true but all the same dont you think that eyesight makes some suggestion of outerness or distance when you approach a distant object do the visible size and shape keep changing or do they appear the same at all distances they are in a continual change so sight doesnt suggest or in any way inform you that the visible object you immediately perceive exists at a distance or that it will be perceived when you move further forward because there is a continued series of visible objects succeeding each other during the whole time of your approach i agree about that but still i know on seeing an object what object i shall see after i have gone a certain distancenever mind whether it is exactly the same object or not so something about distance is still being suggested my dear hylas just think about that a little and then tell me whether there is anything more to it that this from the ideas that you actually perceive by sight you have by experience learned to infer in accordance with the general rules of nature what other ideas you will experience after such and such a succession of time and motion upon the whole i think thats what it comes down to isnt it obvious that if a man born blind were suddenly enabled to see he would start with no experience of what may be suggested by sight it is so he would not according to you have any notion of distance linked to the things he saw he would take the latter to be a new set of sensations existing only in his mind that is undeniable but to make it still more plain isnt distance a line running out from the eye it is can a line so situated be perceived by sight it cannot so doesnt it follow that distance isnt strictly and immediately perceived by sight it seems so again do you think that colours are at a distance i have to acknowledge that they are only in the mind but dont colours appear to the eye as coexisting at the same place as extension and shape they do then how can you conclude from the deliverances of sight that shapes do exist outside the mind when you agree that colours dont the sensible appearances of both are the very same i dont know what to answer even if distance were truly and immediately perceived by the mind it still wouldnt follow that it existed out of the mind for whatever is immediately perceived is an idea and can any idea exist out of the mind it would be absurd to suppose so but tell me philonous can we perceive or know nothing except our ideas set aside what we may know through the rational deducing of causes from effects that is irrelevant to our enquiry as for the senses you are the best judge of whether you perceive anything that you dont immediately perceive and i ask you are the things you immediately perceive anything but your own sensations or ideas in the course of this conversation you have more than once declared yourself on those two points this latest question of yours seems to indicate that you have changed your mind to tell you the truth philonous i think there are two kinds of objects one kind perceived immediately and called ideas the other kind are real things or external objects perceived by the mediation of ideas which resemble and represent them now i grant that ideas dont exist outside the mind but the second sort of objects do i am sorry i didnt think of this distinction sooner it would probably have cut short your discourse are those external objects perceived by sense or by some other faculty they are perceived by sense what is there anything perceived by sense that isnt immediately perceived yes philonous there isin a way for example when i look at a picture or statue of julius caesar i may be said to perceive him in a fashion though not immediately by my senses you seem to hold then that our ideas which are all that we immediately perceive are pictures of external things and that the latter are also perceived by sense because they have a conformity or resemblance to our ideas that is my meaning and in the same way that julius caesar in himself invisible is nevertheless perceived by sight so also real things in themselves imperceptible are perceived by sense in the very same way tell me hylas when you look at the picture of julius caesar do you see with your eyes anything more than some colours and shapes with a certain symmetry and composition of the whole nothing else and wouldnt a man who had never known anything about julius caesar see as much he would so he has his sight and the use of it as perfectly as you have yours i agree with you then why are your thoughts directed to the roman emperor while his are not this cant come from the sensations or ideas of sense that you perceive at that moment for you have agreed that you have in that respect no advantage over the man who has never heard of julius caesar so it seems that the direction of your thoughts comes from reason and memorydoesnt it it does so that example of yours doesnt show that anything is perceived by sense that isnt immediately perceived i dont deny that we can be said in a certain sense to perceive sensible things mediately by sense that is when the immediate perception of ideas by one sense suggests to the mind others perhaps belonging to another sense of a kind that have often been perceived to go with ideas of the former kind for instance when i hear a coach drive along the streets all that i immediately perceive is the sound but from my past experience that such a sound is connected with a coach i am said to hear the coach still it is obvious that in truth and strictness nothing can be heard but sound and the coach in that example is not strictly perceived by sense but only suggested from experience similarly when we are said to see a redhot bar of iron the solidity and heat of the iron are not the objects of sight but are suggested to the imagination by the colour and shape that are strictly perceived by that sense in short the only things that are actually and strictly perceived by any sense are the ones that would have been perceived even if we had only just acquired that sense and were using it for the first time as for other things clearly they are only suggested to the mind by past experience but to return to your comparison of imperceptible real things with caesars picture obviously if you keep to this youll have to hold that the real things that our ideas copy are perceived not by sense but by some internal faculty of the soul such as reason or memory i would be interested to know what arguments reason gives you for the existence of your real things or material objects or whether you remember seeing them formerly not as copied by your ideas but as they are in themselves or if you have heard or read of anyone else who did i can see that you want to make fun of me philonous but that will never convince me all i want is to learn from you how to come by knowledge of material things whatever we perceive is perceived either immediately by sense or mediately by reason and reflection but you have excluded sense so please show me what reason you have to believe in their existence or what means you can possibly adopt to prove to my understanding or your own that they exist to be perfectly frank philonous now that i think about it i cant find any good reason for my position but it seems pretty clear that its at least possible that such things really exist and as long as there is no absurdity in supposing them i shall continue in my belief until you bring good reasons to the contrary what has it come to this that you believe in the existence of material objects and that this belief is based on the mere possibility of its being true then you challenge me to bring reasons against it though some people would think that the burden of proof lies with him who holds the affirmative position anyway this very thesis that you are now determined to maintain without any reason is in effect one that you havemore than once during this conversationseen good reason to give up but let us set all that aside if i understand you rightly you say our ideas dont exist outside the mind but that they are copies likenesses or representations of certain originals that do you have me right our ideas then are like external things they are do those external things have a stable and permanent nature independently of our senses or do they keep changing as we move our bodies and do things with our faculties or organs of sense real things obviously have a fixed and real nature which remains the same through any changes in our senses or in how our bodies are placed or how they move such changes may indeed affect the ideas in our minds but it would be absurd to think they had the same effect on things existing outside the mind how then can things that are perpetually fleeting and variable as our ideas are be copies or likenesses of any thing that is fixed and constant since all sensible qualitiessize shape colour etcthat is our ideas are continually changing with every alteration in the distance medium or instruments of sensation how can any fixed material object be properly represented or depicted by several distinct things or ideas each of which is so unlike the others or if you say that the object resembles just one of our ideas how can we distinguish that true copy from all the false ones i have to admit philonous that i am at a loss i dont know what to say to this there is more are material objects in themselves perceptible or imperceptible properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but ideas all material things therefore are in themselves insensible and can be perceived only through ideas of them ideas are sensible then and their originalsthe things they are copies ofare insensible right but how can something that is sensible be like something that is insensible can a real thing in itself invisible be like a colour can a real thing that isnt audible be like a sound in a word can anything be like a sensation or idea but another sensation or idea i must admit that i think not can there possibly be any doubt about this dont you perfectly know your own ideas yes i know them perfectly for something that i dont perceive or know cant be any part of my idea well then examine your ideas and then tell me if theres anything in them that could exist outside the mind or if you can conceive anything like them existing outside the mind upon looking into it i find that i cant conceive or understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea and it is most evident that no idea can exist outside the mind so youre forced by your own principles to deny the reality of sensible things because you made it consist in an absolute existence outside the mind that is to say you are a downright sceptic so i have met my target which was to show that your principles lead to scepticism for the present i am if not entirely convinced at least silenced i wonder what more you would require in order to be perfectly convinced havent you been free to explain yourself in any way you liked were any little conversational slips held against you werent you allowed to retract or reinforce anything you had previously said as best served your purpose hasnt everything you could say been heard and examined with all the fairness imaginable in a word havent you on every point been convinced out of your own mouth and if you can now discover any flaw in any of your former concessions or think of any remaining tactic any new distinction shading or comment whatsoever why dont you produce it a little patience philonous i am at present so bewildered to see myself entangled and as it were imprisoned in the labyrinths you have led me into that i cant be expected to find my way out on the spur of the moment you must give me time to look around me and recollect myself listenisnt that the collegebell let us go in and meet here again tomorrow morning in the mean time you can think about this mornings conversation and see if you can find any fallacy in it or invent any new means to extricate yourself agreed the second dialogue hylas i beg your pardon philonous for not meeting you sooner all this morning my head was so filled with our recent conversation that i didnt notice the time of the day or indeed anything else philonous i am glad you were so focussed on it i hope that if there were any mistakes in your concessions or fallacies in my reasonings from them you will now show them to me i assure you ever since i saw you i have done nothing but search for mistakes and fallacies and with that in mind i have examined in detail the whole course of yesterdays conversation but it has all been useless for the views i was led into in the conversation seemed even clearer and more obvious when i reviewed them today and the more i think about them the more irresistibly they force my assent to them dont you think that this is a sign that they are genuine and that they proceed from nature and are in accordance with right reason truth and beauty have this in common they both show to advantage when looked at closely and carefully the false glitter of error and heavy makeup cant endure being looked at for too long or from too close up i admit there is a great deal in what you say and i am as convinced as anyone could be of the truth of those strange consequences that you argued for yesterday so long as i keep in mind the reasonings that lead to them but when those arguments are out of my thoughts my mind goes the other way there seems to be something so satisfactory natural and intelligible in the modern way of explaining things that i confess that i dont know how to reject it i dont know what way you mean i mean the modern way of accounting for our sensations or ideas how does it do that it is supposed that the mind resides in some part of the brain from which the nerves originate spreading out from there to all parts of the body that outer objects act in different ways on the senseorgans starting up certain vibrations in the nerves that the nerves pass these vibrations along to the brain where the mind is located and that the mind is variously affected with ideas according to the various impressions or traces the vibrations make in the brain and call you this an explanation of how we are affected with ideas why not philonous have you any objection to it i need to know first whether i have rightly understood your modern hypothesis according to it certain traces in the brain are the causes or occasions of our ideas the special meaning of occasion that is at work here will be explained on page it doesnt matter in the mean time tell me please do you mean by the brain a sensible thing what else do you think i could possibly mean sensible things are all immediately perceivable and things that are immediately perceivable are ideas and these exist only in the mind this much if i am not mistaken you have long since agreed to i dont deny it so the brain that you speak of being a sensible thing exists only in the mind i would like to know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that one idea or thing existing in the mind occasions all the other ideas and if you do think this how do you account for the origin of that primary idea or brain itself i dont explain the origin of our ideas by the brain which is perceivable to sense because it is as you say only a combination of sensible ideas i am talking about another brain which i imagine but arent imagined things just as much in the mind as perceived things are i must admit that they are so the difference between perceiving and imagining isnt important you have been accounting for ideas by certain motions or impressions in the brain that is by some alterations in an ideaand it doesnt matter whether it is sensible or imaginable i begin to suspect my hypothesis apart from spirits our own ideas are the only things we know or conceive so when you say that all ideas are occasioned by impressions in the brain do you conceive this brain or not if you do then you talk of ideas imprinted on an idea causing that same idea which is absurd if you dont conceive it you talk unintelligibly instead of forming a reasonable hypothesis i can now see clearly that it was a mere dream there is nothing in it its no great loss for after all this way of explaining things as you called it could never have satisfied any reasonable man what connection is there between a vibration in the nerves and sensations of sound or colour in the mind how could one possibly cause the other but i could never have seen it as being so empty as it now seems to be well then are you finally satisfied that no sensible things have a real existence and that you are in truth a complete sceptic it is too plain to be denied look arent the fields covered with a delightful green isnt there something in the woods and groves in the rivers and clear springs that soothes delights transports the soul at the view of the wide and deep ocean or some huge mountain whose top is lost in the clouds or of an old gloomy forest arent our minds filled with a pleasing horror even in rocks and deserts isnt there an agreeable wildness it is such a sincere pleasure to see earths natural beauties doesnt she preserve and renew our enjoyment of them by intermittently drawing the veil of over her face and doesnt she change her dress with the seasons how aptly the elements are disposed what variety and usefulness even in the lowest things that nature produces what delicacy what beauty what complexity of organization in the bodies of animals and plants how finely all things are suited to their particular ends and also to their roles as appropriate parts of the whole and while they mutually aid and support dont they also display each other in a better light raise now your thoughts from this globe of earth to all those glorious glittering objects that adorn the high arch of heaven the motion and situation of the planetsarent they admirably orderly have those globes ever been known to stray in their repeated journeys through pathless space doesnt each of them sweep out the same area between itself and the sun in any two equal periods of time so fixed and unchanging are the laws by which the unseen author of nature runs the universe how vivid and radiant is the shine of the fixed stars how magnificent and rich the careless profusion with which they seem to be scattered throughout the whole vault of the sky yet the telescope brings into view a new host of stars that escape the naked eye here they seem to be nearby and small but a closer view through a telescope shows them to be immense orbs of light at various distances sunk deep in the abyss of space now you must call imagination to your aid so as to get some imaginative picture of things you cant actually see our feeble limited senses cant pick out innumerable worlds planets revolving round the central fires suns in each of which the energy of an allperfect mind is displayed in endless forms so those are things you must simply imagine but neither sense nor imagination is big enough to take in the boundless extent of the universe with all its glittering furniture with all the hard work that we give to those two faculties exerting and straining each of them to its utmost reach theres always a vast surplus left ungrasped yet all the vast bodies that make up this mighty universe however distant they may be are by some secret mechanismsome divine power and artificelinked in a mutual dependence and interconnection with each other and with this earth which almost slipped out of my thoughts getting lost in the crowd of worlds isnt the whole system immense beautiful more glorious than we can say or think then how should we treat those philosophers who want to deprive these noble and delightful scenes of all reality how should we think of principles implying that all the visible beauty of the creation is a false imaginary glare to put it bluntly can you expect this scepticism of yours not to be thought extravagantly absurd by all reasonable people other men may think as they please but you have nothing to reproach me with my comfort is that you are as much a sceptic as i am there hylas i beg leave to differ from you what having along agreed to the premises are you now denying the conclusion and leaving me to maintain by myself these paradoxes that you led me into this surely isnt fair i deny that i agreed with you in those views that led to scepticism you indeed said that the reality of sensible things consisted in an absolute existence out of the minds of spirits or distinct from their being perceived and under the guidance of this notion of reality you are obliged to deny that sensible things have any real existence that is according to your own definition on page you declare yourself to be a sceptic but i didnt say and didnt think that the reality of sensible things should be defined in that manner to me it is evident for the reasons you agree to that sensible things cant exist except in a mind or spirit from this i conclude not that they have no real existence but thatseeing they dont depend on my thought and have an existence distinct from being perceived by methere must be some other mind in which they exist as sure as the sensible world really exists therefore so sure is there an infinite omnipresent spirit who contains and supports it what this is no more than i and all christians holdand indeed all nonchristians who believe there is a god and that he knows and understands everything yes but heres the difference men commonly believe that all things are known or perceived by god because they believe in the existence of a god whereas for me the order of reasons is reversed i immediately and necessarily conclude the existence of a god because all sensible things must be perceived by him as long as we all believe the same thing what does it matter how we come by that belief but we dont believe the same thing philosophers hold that god perceives all corporeal things but they attribute to such things an absolute existence independently of their being perceived by any mind whatever and i dont besides isnt there a difference between saying there is a god therefore he perceives all things and saying sensible things do really exist if they really exist they must be perceived by an infinite mind therefore there is an infinite mind or god this provides you with a direct and immediate proof from a most evident premise of the existence of a god theologians and philosophers had proved beyond all controversy from the beauty and usefulness of the various parts of the creation that it was the workmanship of god but some of us have the advantage that we can prove the existence of an infinite mind from the bare existence of the sensible world without getting help from astronomy and natural philosophy and without bringing in facts about how wonderfully the parts of the world relate to one another what gives us this advantage is just the simple thought that the sensible world is what we perceive by our various senses that nothing is perceived by the senses except ideas and that no idea and no thing of which an idea is a copy can exist otherwise than in a mind with that at your disposal you can now oppose and baffle the most strenuous advocate for atheism without any laborious search into the sciences without any sophisticated reasoning and without tediously long arguments this single reflection on impossibility that the visible world or any part of iteven the most lowgrade and shapeless part of itshould exist outside a mind is enough to overthrow the whole system of atheism it destroys those miserable refuges of the atheist the eternal succession of unthinking causes and effects or the chance coming together of atomsthose wild fantasies of vanini hobbes and spinoza let any one of those supporters of impiety look into his own thoughts and see if he can conceive how so much as a rock a desert a chaos or a confused jumble of atomshow anything at all either sensible or imaginablecan exist independently of a mind and he need go no further to be convinced of his folly can anything be fairer than to let the disagreement be settled by the outcome of such a test leaving it to the atheist himself to see if he can conceive even in thought the state of affairs that he holds to be true in fact it is undeniable that there is something highly serviceable to religion in the position you are taking but dont you think it looks very like the view of some eminent recent philosophersnotably malebranchethat we see all things in god i would gladly know about that please explain it to me they think that because the soul or mind is immaterial it cant be united with material things so as to perceive them in themselves but that it perceives them through its union with the substance of god because that is a spiritual substance it is purely intelligible that is capable of being the immediate object of a human minds thought furthermore gods essence contains perfections corresponding to each created thing and this correspondence enables those perfections to represent created things to the human mind i dont understand how our ideas which are entirely passive and inert can be or be like any part of the essence of god who is indivisible never passive always active this hypothesis is open to many other obvious objections but i shall only add that in making a created world exist otherwise than in the mind of a spirit the hypothesis of malebranche is liable to all the absurdities of the more usual views added to which it has a special absurdity all its own namely that it makes the material world serve no purpose if it is valid to argue against other hypotheses in the sciences that they suppose nature or the divine wisdom to make something for no purpose or to employ tedious roundabout methods to get a result which could have been achieved much more easily and swiftly what are we to think of this hypothesis which supposes that the whole world was made for no purpose but dont you also hold that we see all things in god if im not mistaken your thesis comes near to that few men think but all insist on having opinions which is why mens opinions are superficial and confused it isnt surprising that doctrines which in themselves are ever so different should nevertheless be confused with one another by people who dont think hard about them so i shant be surprised if some men imagine that i run into the wild fantasies of malebranche though in truth i am very remote from them he builds on the most abstract general ideas which i entirely disclaim he asserts an absolute external world which i deny he maintains that we are deceived by our senses and dont know the real natures or the true forms and shapes of extended things of all which i hold the direct contrary so that overall there are no principles more fundamentally opposite than his and mine i have to say that i entirely agree with what the holy scripture says that in god we live and move and have our being but i am far from believing that we see things in his essence in the manner you have presented here is my view in a nutshell it is evident that the things i perceive are my own ideas and that no idea can exist except in a mind it is equally obvious that these ideas or things perceived by meor things of which they are copiesexist independently of my mind because i know that i am not their author it being out of my power to choose what particular ideas i shall experience when i open my eyes or ears so they must exist in some other mind who wills that they be exhibited to me the things i immediately perceive i repeat are ideas or sensations call them what you will but how can any idea or sensation exist in or be produced by anything other than a mind or spirit that really is inconceivable and to assert something that is inconceivable is to talk nonsense isnt it without doubt on the other side it is very conceivable that ideas or sensations should exist in and be produced by a spirit because this is just what i experience daily in myself when i perceive countless ideas and by an act of my will can form a great variety of them raising them up in my imagination though i have to say that these creatures of my imagination are not as distinct strong vivid and permanent as are the ones i perceive through my senses which latter are called real things from all this i conclude that there is a mind that affects me every moment with all the sensible impressions i perceive and from the variety order and manner of these impressions i conclude that the author of them is wise powerful and good beyond anything i can comprehend please get this straight i do not sayas malebranche doesthat i see things by perceiving something that represents them in the intelligible essence of god i dont even understand that what i say is this the things i perceive are known by the understanding and produced by the will of an infinite spirit isnt all this very plain and evident is there anything more in it than what a little observation of our own minds and what happens in them not only enables us to conceive but also obliges us to assent to i think i understand you very clearly and i admit that the proof you give of a deity is as convincing as it is surprising but granting that god is the supreme and universal cause of all things mightnt there be a third kind of thing besides spirits and ideas may we not admit a subordinate and limited cause of our ideas in a word may there not for all that be matter how often must i teach you the same thing you agree that the things immediately perceived by sense exist nowhere outside the mind but everything that is perceived by sense is perceived immediately therefore there is nothing sensible or perceivable that exists outside the mind so the matter that you still insist on is presumably meant to be something intelligiblesomething that can be discovered by reason and not by the senses you are in the right pray let me know what reasoning your belief in matter is based on and what this matter is in your present sense of the word i find myself affected with various ideas which i know i havent caused and they couldnt cause themselves or cause one another nor could they exist on their own because they are wholly inactive transient dependent beings so they have some cause other than me and other than themselves all i claim to know about this is that it is the cause of my ideas and this thing whatever it is i call matter tell me hylas is everyone free to change the current proper meaning of a common word in any language for example suppose a traveller told you that in a certain country men can pass unhurt through the fire and when he explained himself you found that he meant by fire what others call water or suppose he said that there are trees that walk on two legs meaning men by the term trees would you think this reasonable no i should think it very absurd common custom is the standard of correctness in language and deliberately to speak improperly is to pervert the use of speech and cant achieve anything except to prolong and multiply disputes when there is no real difference of opinion and doesnt matter in the common current meaning of the word signify an extended solid movable unthinking inactive substance it does and hasnt it been made evident that no such substance can possibly exist and even if it did exist how can something inactive be a cause and how can something unthinking be a cause of thought you are free to give the word matter a meaning that is contrary to its ordinary one and to tell me that you understand by matter an unextended thinking active being which is the cause of our ideas but this is just playing with words committing the very fault that you have just now rightly condemned i dont find fault with your reasoning in that you infer a cause from the phenomena but i deny that the cause that reason allows you to infer can properly be called matter there is indeed something in what you say but i am afraid you dont properly grasp what i mean i wouldnt want you to take me to be denying that god or an infinite spirit is the supreme cause of all things all i am arguing is that subordinate to the supreme agent or cause there is a cause of a limited and lower kind which concurs in goes along with the production of our ideas not by the action proper to spirits namely acts of will but by the action proper to matter namely motion you keep relapsing into your old exploded notion of a movable and consequently extended substance existing outside the mind what have you already forgotten what you were convinced of do you want me to repeat everything i have said about this really this isnt arguing fairly still to assume the existence of something that you have so often admitted not to exist but letting that go i ask arent all your ideas perfectly passive and inert including no kind of action in them they are and are sensible qualities anything else but ideas how often have i agreed that they are not but isnt motion a sensible quality it is consequently it is no action i agree with you and indeed it is obvious that when i move my finger it remains passive but my will that produced the motion is active now i want to know in the first place whether given that motion is not action you can conceive any action other than volition in the second place whether to say something and conceive nothing is not to talk nonsense and lastly whether having considered the premises you dont see that it is highly absurd and unreasonable to suppose that our ideas have any efficient or active cause other than spirit i give up the point entirely but although matter may not be a cause what blocks it from being an instrument subservient to the supreme agent in the production of our ideas an instrument you say please tell me about the shape springs wheels and motions of that instrument i dont claim to be able to do that because both this substance and its qualities are entirely unknown to me what so you think it is made up of unknown parts and has unknown motions and an unknown shape i dont think it has any shape or motion at all because you have convinced me that no sensible qualities can exist in an unperceiving substance but what notion can we possibly have of an instrument that has no sensible qualities not even extension i dont claim to have any notion of it and what reason do you have to think that this unknown and inconceivable something does exist is it that you think god cannot act as well without it or that you find by experience that some such thing is at work when you form ideas in your own mind you are always nagging me for reasons for what i believe what reasons do you have for not believing it for me seeing no reason for believing something is a sufficient reason for not believing it but setting aside reasons for believing you will not so much as let me know what it is you want me to believe since you say you have no sort of notion of it i beg you to consider whether it is like a philosopher or even like a man of common sense to claim to believe you know not what and you know not why hold on philonous when i tell you that matter is an instrument i dont mean absolutely nothing admittedly i dont know what the particular kind of instrument it is but still i have some notion of instrument in general which i apply to it but what if it should turn out that even the most general notion of instrument understood as meaning something distinct from cause contains something that makes the use of an instrument inconsistent with the divine attributes show me that and i shall give up the point i shall now do so what do you mean by the general nature or notion of instrument the general notion is made up of what is common to all particular instruments dont all instruments have this in common they are used only in doing things that cant be performed by the mere act of our wills thus for instance i never use an instrument to move my finger because it is done by a volition but i would use an instrument if i wanted to remove part of a rock or tear up a tree by the roots do you agree with this or can you show any example where an instrument is used in producing an effect which immediately depends on the will of the agent i admit that i cant well then how can you suppose that an allperfect spirit on whose will all things absolutely and immediately depend would need an instrument in his operations or that he would use one if he didnt need it thus it seems to me you have to admit that it would be incompatible with the infinite perfection of god for him to use a lifeless inactive instrument such as matter is supposed to be that is your own statements oblige you to give up the point no answer to that comes readily to mind there is an answer that should come to your mind you should be ready to admit to the truth when it has been fairly proved to you i shall state the proof again we beings whose powers are finite are forced to make use of instruments and the use of an instrument shows that the agent is limited by rules that were prescribed by someone else and not by him and that he cannot get what he wants except in suchandsuch a way and in suchandsuch conditions this seems clearly to imply that the supreme unlimited agent uses no tool or instrument at all an omnipotent spirit has only to will that something happen and it happens straight off without the use of any means when means are employed by inferior agents like you and me it isnt because of any real causal power that is in them any necessary fitness to produce the desired effect rather it is to comply with the laws of nature or those conditions prescribed to us by god the first cause who is himself above all limitation or prescription whatsoever i will no longer maintain that matter is an instrument but dont take me to be giving up on its existence because despite everything you have said it may still be an occasion how many shapes is your matter to take how often must it be proved not to exist before you are content to let it go by all the laws of debate i am entitled to blame you for so frequently changing the meaning of the principal term matter but i shant press that point instead i ask you this having already denied matter to be a cause what do you mean when you affirm that it is an occasion and when you have shown what you mean by occasion then please show me what reason leads you to believe there is such an occasion of our ideas as to the first point by occasion i mean an inactive unthinking being at the presence of which god causes ideas in our minds and what may be the nature of that inactive unthinking being i know nothing of its nature proceed then to the second point and give me some reason why we should believe in the existence of this inactive unthinking unknown thing when we see ideas produced in our minds in an orderly and constant manner it is natural to think they have some fixed and regular occasions at the presence of which they are excited you acknowledge then that god alone is the cause of our ideas and that he causes them in the presence of those occasions that is what i think no doubt god perceives the things that you say are present to him certainly otherwise they couldnt provide him with occasions of acting without insisting now on your making sense of this hypothesis or on your answering all the puzzling questions and difficulties that beset it i merely ask isnt the order and regularity found in the series of our ideasthat is the course of naturesufficiently explained by the wisdom and power of god doesnt it take away from gods wisdom and power to suppose that any unthinking substance influences or directs him concerning what to do and when to do it even if i granted you all that you contend for regarding matter as gods occasion for acting would you get the result you want the point of the last question is that its hard to see how the external or absolute existence of an unthinking substance distinct from its being perceived can be inferred from there being certain things perceived by the mind of god which are to him the occasion of producing ideas in us i am utterly at a loss about what to think this notion of occasion now seems to be just as groundless as the rest dont you at last see that in all these different senses of matter you have only been supposing you know not what for no reason and to no purpose i freely admit to having become less fond of my notions since you have examined them in such precise detail but still i think i have some confused perception that there is such a thing as matter either you perceive the existence of matter immediately or you perceive it mediately if immediately please tell me by which of the senses you perceive it if mediately let me know what reasoning you employ to infer it from things that you do perceive immediately so much for the perception then for the matter itself i ask whether it is object substratum cause instrument or occasion you have already argued for each of these shifting your notions and making matter appear first in one guise and then in another and each thing you have offered has been disapproved and rejected by yourself if you have anything new to advance i would gladly hear it i think i have already offered all i had to say on those topics i am at a loss what more to urge and yet youre reluctant to part with your old prejudice but to make it easier for you to drop it i ask you to consideras well as all my other pointsthe question of how you could possibly be affected by matter if it did exist and the question of whether it would make any difference to the ideas you experienceand thus make any difference to your reasons to believe in its existenceif matter didnt exist i agree that it is possible we might perceive all things just as we do now without there being any matter in the world and in answer to your first question i cant conceive how matterif there is such a thingcould produce any idea in our minds and i also admit that you have entirely satisfied me that it is impossible for there to be such a thing as matter in any of the previous senses of the term but still i cant help supposing that there is matter in some sense or other i dont claim to settle what sense that is i dont demand that you define exactly the nature of that unknown being just tell me whether it is a substance and if it is whether you can suppose a substance without qualities and if on the other hand you suppose it to have qualities please tell me what those qualities are or at least what it means to say that matter supports them we have already argued on those points i have no more to say about them but to head off any further questions let me tell you that i now understand by matter neither substance nor accident thinking nor extended being neither cause instrument nor occasion but something entirely unknown different from all those it seems then that you include in your present notion of matter nothing but the general abstract of idea of entity or thing nothing else except that i add to this general idea of thing the negation of all those particular things qualities or ideas that i perceive imagine or in any way apprehend where please do you suppose that this unknown matter exists oh philonous now you think you have entangled me for if i say it exists in some place you will infer that it exists in the mind since we agree that place or extension exists only in the mind but i am not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know where it exists but i am sure it doesnt exist in a place there is a negative answer for you and such answers are all you can expect to get for all your remaining questions about matter since you wont tell me where it exists please inform me about how you suppose it to exist or what you mean by saying that it exists it neither thinks nor acts neither perceives nor is perceived but what positive content is there in your abstracted notion of its existence when i look into it carefully i dont find that i have any positive notion or meaning at all i tell you again i am not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know what is meant by its existence or how it exists keep up this frankness good hylas and tell me sincerely whether you can form a distinct idea of entity in general abstracting from and excluding all thinking and corporeal beings all particular things whatsoever hold on let me think a littlei confess philonous i dont find that i can at first glance i thought i had some dilute and airy notion of pure entity in abstract but when i focussed on it it vanished the more i think about it the more am i confirmed in my wise decision to give only negative answers to your questions and not to claim the slightest positive knowledge or conception of matter its where its how its entity or anything about it so when you speak of the existence of matter you have no notion in your mind none at all here is where i think we have got to please tell me if i am wrong you attributed existence outside the mind first to the immediate objects of our perceptions this came from your belief in material substance then to their archetypesthe things of which they are copies then to their causes then to instruments then to occasions and lastly to something in general which on examination turns out to be nothing so matter comes to nothing what do you think hylas isnt this a fair summary of your whole proceeding be that as it may yet i still insist that our not being able to conceive a thing is no argument against its existence i freely grant that the existence of a thing that is not immediately perceived may reasonably be inferred from a cause effect operation sign or other circumstance and that it would be absurd for any man to argue against the existence of that thing from his having no direct and positive notion of it but where there is nothing of all this where neither reason nor revelation induces us to believe in the existence of a thing we dont have even a relative notion of it what is offered is so abstract that it rises above the distinction between perceiving and being perceived between spirit and idea and lastly not even the most inadequate or faint idea of it is claimed to exist where all this is the case i shant indeed draw any conclusion against the reality of any notion or against the existence of anything but i shall infer that you mean nothing at all that you are using words to no purpose without any design or meaning whatsoever and i leave it to you to consider how such mere jargon should be treated to be frank philonous your arguments seem in themselves unanswerable but their effect on me has not been enough to produce that total conviction that wholehearted agreement that comes with demonstration rigorous knockdown proof i find myself still relapsing into an obscure surmise of somethingorother that i call matter but dont you realize hylas that two things must cooperate to take away all doubts and produce a complete mental assent however clear the light is in which a visible object is set it wont be distinctly seen if there is any imperfection in the vision or if the eye is not directed towards it and however solid and clearly presented a demonstration is yet if there is also prejudice or wrong bias in the understanding can it be expected all at once to see the truth clearly and adhere to it firmly no for that to happen time and effort are needed the attention must be awakened and held by frequent repetition of the same thingoften in the same light often in different lights i have said it already and find i must still repeat it to get you to accept it when you claim to accept you dont know what for you dont know what reason and for you dont know what purpose you are taking extraordinary liberties can this be parallelled in any art or science any sect or profession of men or is there anything so shamelessly groundless and unreasonable to be met with even in the lowest of common conversation but you persist in saying matter may exist without knowing what you mean by matter or what you mean by saying that it exists what makes this especially surprising is the fact that its something you have just decided to say you arent led to it by any reasons at all for i challenge you to show me something in nature that needs matter to explain or account for it the reality of things cant be maintained without supposing the existence of matter dont you think this is a good reason why i should be earnest in its defence the reality of things what things sensible or intelligible sensible things my glove for example that or any other thing perceived by the senses let us fix on one particular thing isnt it a sufficient evidence to me of the existence of this glove that i see it and feel it and wear it and if it isnt how could i be assured of the reality of this thing which i actually see in this place by supposing that some unknown thing which i never did or can see exists in an unknown manner in an unknown place or in no place at all how can the supposed reality of something intangible be a proof that anything tangible really exists or of something invisible that any visible thing really exists put generally how can the supposed reality of something imperceptible be a proof of the existence of a perceptible thing explain this and i shall think that nothing is too hard for you overall i am content to admit that the existence of matter is highly improbable but i dont see that it is directly and absolutely impossible even if matter is granted to be possible that doesnt give it a claim to existence any more than a golden mountain or a centaur which are also possible i admit that but still you dont deny that it is possible and something that is possible may for all you know actually exist i do deny it to be possible and i think i have proved that it isnt from premises that you have conceded in the ordinary sense of the word matter is anything more implied than an extended solid shaped movable substance existing outside the mind and havent you admitted over and over that youve seen evident reason for denying the possibility of such a substance true but that is only one sense of the term matter but isnt it the only proper genuine commonly accepted sense and if matter in such a sense is proved impossible may it not be thought with good grounds to be absolutely impossible otherwise how could anything be proved impossible indeed how could there be any proof at all of anything to a man who feels free to unsettle and change the common meanings of words i thought philosophers might be allowed to speak more accurately than common people do and were not always confined to the common meaning of a term but the meaning i have stated is the common accepted sense among philosophers anyway setting that point aside havent i let you take matter in whatever sense you pleased and havent you used this privilege to the utmost extent sometimes entirely changing the meaning at others leaving out or putting into the definition of matter whatever at that moment best served your purposes contrary to all the known rules of reason and logic and hasnt this shifting unfair method of yours spun out our dispute to an unnecessary length matter having been scrutinised in each particular one of those senses and by your own admission refuted in each of them and can any more be required to prove the absolute impossibility of a thing than to prove it to be impossible in every particular sense that you or anyone else understands it in i am not so thoroughly satisfied that you have proved the impossibility of matter in the last most obscure abstracted and indefinite sense when is a thing shown to be impossible when an inconsistency is demonstrated between the ideas contained in its definition but where there are no ideas no contradiction between ideas can be demonstrated i agree with you now consider the sense of the word matter that you have just called obscure and indefinite by your own admission it is obvious that this includes no idea at all no senseexcept an unknown sense which is the same thing as none so you cant expect me to prove an inconsistency between ideas where there are no ideas or to prove the impossibility of matter taken in an unknown sense that is in no sense at all i aimed only to show that you meant nothing and i got you to admit that so that in all your various senses you have been shown to mean nothing at all or if something then an absurdity if this isnt sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing i wish you would tell me what is i admit that you have proved that matter is impossible nor do i see what else can be said in defence of it but when i give up matter i come to suspect all my other notions for surely none could be more seemingly evident than this once was yet it now seems as false and absurd as it previously seemed true but i think we have discussed the point enough for the present i would like to spend the rest of today running over in my thoughts the various parts of this mornings conversation and ill be glad to meet you again here tomorrow at about the same time ill be here the third dialogue philonous tell me hylas what has come of yesterdays meditation has it confirmed you in the views you held when we parted or has it given you cause to change your opinion hylas truly my opinion is that all our opinions are equally useless and uncertain what we approve today we condemn tomorrow we make a fuss about knowledge and spend our lives in the pursuit of it yet all the time alas we know nothing and i dont think we can ever know anything in this life our faculties are too narrow and too few nature certainly never intended us for speculation for the pursuit of true theories what you say we can know nothing hylas there isnt one single thing in the world whose real nature we can know are you going to tell me that i dont really know what fire or water is you may indeed know that fire appears hot and water fluid but that is merely knowing what sensations are produced in your own mind when fire or water is applied to your senseorgans you are utterly in the dark as to their internal constitution their true and real nature dont i know that this is a real stone that im standing on and that what i see before my eyes is a real tree know no it is impossible that you or any man alive should know it all you know is that you have such and such an idea or appearance in your own mind but what does that have to do with the real tree or stone i tell you the colour shape and hardness that you perceive arent the real natures of those things or in the least like them the same may be said of all other real things or corporeal substances that make up the world none of them has in itself anything like the sensible qualities that we perceive so we shouldnt claim to affirm or know anything about them as they are in their own nature but surely hylas i can distinguish gold for example from iron how could i do that if i didnt know what either truly was believe me philonous you can only distinguish between your own ideas that yellowness that weight and other sensible qualitiesdo you think that they are really in the gold they are only relations to the senses and have no absolute existence in nature and in claiming to distinguish the species of real things on the basis of the appearances in your mind you may be acting as foolishly as someone who inferred that two men were of a different species because their clothes were of different colours it seems then that we are fobbed off with the appearances of things and false appearances at that the food i eat and the clothes i wear have nothing in them that is like what i see and feel just so but isnt it strange that everyone should be thus deceived and be so foolish as to believe their senses and yet men i dont know how eat and drink and sleep and get on with their lives as comfortably and conveniently as if they really knew the things they have to deal with they do so but you know ordinary practical affairs dont require precise theoretical knowledge so the common people can retain their mistakes and yet manage to bustle through the affairs of life but philosophers know better things you mean they know that they know nothing that is the very peak and perfection of human knowledge but are you serious about all this hylas are you really convinced that you know nothing real in the world if you were going to write wouldnt you call for pen ink and paper like anyone else and wouldnt you know what it was you were calling for how often must i tell you that i dont know the real nature of any single thing in the universe it is true that i sometimes use pen ink and paper but i declare positively that i dont know what any of them is in its own true nature and the same is true with regard to every other corporeal thing furthermore we are ignorant not only of the true and real nature of things but even of their existence it cant be denied that we perceive certain appearances or ideas but it cant be concluded from this that bodies really exist indeed now that i think about it my former concessions oblige me to declare that it is impossible that any real corporeal thing should exist in nature you amaze me was ever anything more wild and extravagant than the notions you now maintain isnt it evident that you are led into all these extravagances by the belief in material substance thats what makes you dream of those unknown natures in every thing it is what leads you to distinguish the reality of things from their sensible appearances it is to this that you are indebted for being ignorant of what everyone else knows perfectly well nor is this all you are ignorant not only of the true nature of every thing but of whether any thing really exists or whether there are any true natures at all because you attribute to your material beings an absolute or external existence and suppose that their reality consists in that as you are eventually forced to admit that such an existence means either a direct contradiction or nothing at all it follows that you are obliged to pull down your own hypothesis of material substance and positively to deny the real existence of any part of the universe and so you are plunged into the deepest and most deplorable scepticism that anyone ever suffered from tell me hylas isnt that what has happened yes it is material substance was no more than an hypothesis and a false and groundless one too i will no longer waste my breath defending it but whatever hypothesis you advance whatever system you introduce in place of it i am sure it will appear every bit as false if you allow me to question you about it allow me to treat you as you have me and ill lead you through as many perplexities and contradictions to the very same state of scepticism that i myself am in at present i assure you hylas i dont claim to formulate any hypothesis at all i have the common mans frame of mind i am simple enough to believe my senses and to leave things as i find them heres what i think in plain words the real things are the very things i see and feel and perceive by my senses i know these and because i find that they satisfy all the needs and purposes of life i have no reason to worry about any other unknown beings a piece of sensible perceptible bread for instance would appease my hunger better than ten thousand times as much of that insensible unintelligible real bread you speak of it is also my opinion that colours and other sensible qualities are in the objects i cant for the life of me help thinking that snow is white and fire hot you indeed who by snow and fire mean certain external unperceived unperceiving substances are right to deny whiteness or heat to be qualities inherent in them but i who understand by snow and fire the things i see and feel am obliged to think as other folk do and as i am no sceptic about the nature of things i am not a sceptic either about their existence that a thing should be really perceived by my senses and at the same time not really exist is to me a plain contradiction since i cannot abstract even in thought the existence of a sensible thing from its being perceived wood stones fire water flesh iron and other such things that i name and talk about are things that i know and i wouldnt have known them if i hadnt perceived them by my senses and things perceived by the senses are immediately perceived and things that are immediately perceived are ideas and ideas cant exist outside the mind so it follows that the existence of things i perceive by my senses consists in being perceived when they are actually perceived therefore there can be no doubt about their existence away then with all that scepticism all those ridiculous philosophical doubts what a joke is it for a philosopher to question the existence of sensible things until it is proved to him from the truthfulness of god or to claim that our knowledge about this falls short of the knowledge we have of things that are obviously selfevident or rigorously proved i might as well doubt my own existence as the existence of the things that i actually see and feel not so fast philonous you say that you cant conceive how sensible things should exist outside the minddont you i do supposing you were annihilated cant you conceive it to be possible that things perceivable by sense might still exist i can but then it must be in another mind when i say that sensible things cant exist out of the mind i dont mean my mind in particular but all minds now they clearly have an existence exterior to my mind since i find by experience that they are independent of it there is therefore some other mind in which they exist during the intervals between the times when i perceive them as likewise they did before my birth and would do after my supposed annihilation and as the same is true with regard to all other finite created minds it necessarily follows that there is an omnipresent eternal mind which knows and comprehends all things and lets us experience them in a certain manner according to rules that he himself has ordained and that we call the laws of nature although comprehends can mean understands here it probably means includesall things are known by and are in the mind of god tell me philonous are all our ideas perfectly inert beings or have they any agency included in them they are altogether passive and inert and isnt god an agent a being purely active i agree so an idea cannot be like god or represent his nature it cannot if you have no idea of the mind of god how can you conceive it to be possible that things exist in his mind that is if you have no idea of his mind how can you have any thought about his mind on the other hand if you can have a thought about the mind of god without having an idea of him then why cant i conceive the existence of matter without having an idea of it i acknowledge that strictly speaking i have no idea either of god or any other spirit for these being active cant be represented by things that are perfectly inert as our ideas are still even though i have no idea of myself because i am a spirit or thinking substance i know that i exist i know this indeed as certainly as i know that my ideas exist i also know what i mean by the terms i and myself and i know this immediately or intuitively though i dont perceive it as i perceive a triangle a colour or a sound the mind spirit soul is the indivisible and unextended thing that thinks acts and perceives it is indivisible because it is unextended and it is unextended because the only extended shaped movable things are ideas and something that perceives ideas and that thinks and wills clearly cant itself be an idea ideas are inactive things that are perceived and spirits are things of a totally different sort so i deny that my soul is an idea or like an idea however my soul can be said to furnish me with an idea of god in a broad sense of the word ideathat is an image or likeness of god though indeed an extremely inadequate one i get my notion of god by reflecting on my own soul heightening its powers and removing its imperfections my basic thought of god therefore is the thought of a thing that is like me except and so on so although i have no inert idea of god in my mind i do have in myself a kind of active image of him because i myself am an image likeness of him and though i dont perceive him by sense still i have a notion of him which is to say that i know him by reflection and reasoning i immediately know my own mind and my own ideas and these give me in an indirect way a grasp of the possibility that other spirits and ideas exist further from the fact that i exist and the fact that i find that my ideas of sense arent caused by me i reason my way to the unavoidable conclusion that a god exists and that all created things exist in his mind so much for your first question by this time you can probably answer your second question for yourself i have shown that there are four different ways in which things can come before the mind and none of them is a way in which matter could come before your mind i you dont perceive matter by mentally representing it as you do an inactive being or idea ii nor do you know it as you know yourself by an act of mentally attending to yourself iii you dont understand it indirectly through a resemblance between it and either your ideas or yourself and iv you dont bring it into your mind by reasoning from what you know immediately all of this makes the case of matter widely different from that of god because your knowledge of him involves iii and iv you say that your own soul supplies you with a kind of idea or image of god but you admit that strictly speaking you have no idea of your soul you even assert that spirits are utterly different in kind from ideas which means that no idea can be like a spirit which implies that there can be no idea of a spirit so you have no idea of spiritual substance yet you insist that spiritual substance exists on the other hand from your having no idea or notion of material substance you infer that material substance doesnt exist is that fair to be consistent you should either admit matter or reject spirit what do you say to this my answer falls into three parts i dont deny the existence of material substance merely because i have no notion of it but because the notion of it is inconsistentto have a notion of it would involve a selfcontradiction for all i know to the contrary there may exist many things of which none of us has or can have any idea or notion whatsoever but such things must be possible ie nothing inconsistent must be included in their definition although we believe in the existence of some things that we dont perceive we oughtnt to believe that any particular thing exists without some reason for thinking so but i have no reason for believing in the existence of matter i have no immediate intuition of it and i cant infer itrigorously or even by probable inferencefrom my sensations ideas notions actions or passions in contrast with this i undeniably know by reflection the existence of myself that is my own soul mind or source of thought you will forgive me if i repeat the same things in answer to the same objections the notion or definition of material substance includes an obvious inconsistency and that is not so for the notion of spirit that ideas should exist in something that doesnt perceive or be produced by something that doesnt act is inconsistent but there is no inconsistency in saying that a perceiving thing is the subject of ideas or that an active thing causes them i concede that the existence of other finite spirits is not immediately evident to us nor have we any way of rigorously proving it but that doesnt put such spirits on a level with material substances because there are the following three differences it is inconsistent to suppose there is matter but not to suppose there are finite spirits there is no argument for matter while there are probable reasons in favour of spirits there are no signs or symptoms that make it reasonable to believe in matter but we see signs and effects indicating that there are other finite agents like ourselves although i dont have an idea of spirit if idea is used strictly i do have a notion of it i dont perceive it as an idea or by means of an idea but i know it by reflection on myself despite all that you have said it seems to me that according to your own way of thinking and by your own principles you should conclude that you are only a system of floating ideas without any substance to support them words shouldnt be used without a meaning and as there is no more meaning in spiritual substance than in material substance the former is to be exploded as well as the latter how often must i repeat it i know or am conscious of my own existence and i know that i myself am not my ideas but something elsea thinking active principle here force or source of energy which perceives knows wills and operates on ideas i know that i one and the same self perceive both colours and sounds that a colour cannot perceive a sound nor a sound a colour and therefore that i am one individual thing distinct from colour and sound and for the same reason distinct from all other sensible things and inert ideas but i am not in the same way conscious of either the existence or the essence of matter on the contrary i know that nothing inconsistent can exist and that the existence of matter implies an inconsistency furthermore i know what i mean when i assert that there is a spiritual substance or support of ideas that is that a spirit knows and perceives ideas but i dont know what people mean when they say that an unperceiving substance contains and supports either ideas or items of which ideas are copies so there is no significant likeness between spirit and matter i admit to being satisfied about this but do you seriously think that the real existence of sensible things consists in their being actually perceived if so how does it come about that all mankind distinguish between them ask the first man you meet and hell tell you that to be perceived is one thing and to exist is another i am content hylas to appeal to the common sense of the world for the truth of my view ask the gardener why he thinks that cherry tree over there exists in the garden and he will tell you because he sees and feels itin short because he perceives it by his senses ask him why he thinks there is no orangetree there and he will tell you because he doesnt perceive one when he perceives something by sense he terms it a real thing and says that it exists and anything that isnt perceivable he says doesnt exist yes philonous i agree that the existence of a sensible thing consists in being perceivable but not in being actually perceived and what is perceivable but an idea and can an idea exist without being actually perceived these are points long since agreed between us however true your view is you must admit that it is shocking and contrary to the common sense of men ask your gardener whether that tree has an existence out of his mind what answer do you think he would give you the same answer that i would give namely that it does exist out of his mind but then surely to a christian it cant be shocking to say that the real tree existing outside his mind is truly known and comprehended by that is exists in the infinite mind of god probably the gardener wont at first glance be aware of the direct and immediate proof there is of thisnamely that the very existence of a tree or any other perceptible thing implies a mind that contains it but the point itself is one that he cant deny what is at issue between the materialists and me is not whether things have a real existence outside the mind of this or that person but whether they exist outside all minds having an existence that doesnt involve being perceived by god some heathens and philosophers have indeed affirmed this but anyone whose notions of god are appropriate to the holy scriptures will think differently but how according to your views do real things differ from chimeras formed by the imagination or the visions of a dream since according to you they are all equally in the mind the ideas formed by the imagination are faint and indistinct also they are entirely dependent on the will but the ideas perceived by sensethat is real thingsare more vivid and clear and they dont in that way depend on our will because they are imprinted on our mind by a spirit other than us so theres no danger of mixing up these real things with the foregoing ideas formed by the imagination and equally little danger of failing to distinguish them from the visions of a dream which are dim irregular and confused and even if dreams were very lively and natural they could easily be distinguished from realities by their not being coherently connected with the preceding and subsequent episodes of our lives in short whatever method you use to distinguish things from chimeras is obviously available to me too for any such method must i presume be based on some perceived difference and i dont want to deprive you of any one thing that you perceive but still philonous you hold that there is nothing in the world but spirits and ideas you must admit that this sounds very odd i agree that the word idea not being commonly used for thing sounds a little peculiar i used it because it implies a necessary relation to the mind and it is now commonly used by philosophers to stand for the immediate objects of the understanding but however odd the proposition may sound in words theres nothing very strange or shocking in what it means which in effect amounts merely to this that there are only perceiving things and perceived things or that every unthinking being is necessarilyfrom the very nature of its existenceperceived by some mind if not by any finite created mind then certainly by the infinite mind of god in whom we live and move and have our being is this as strange as to say that sensible qualities arent in the objects or that we cant be sure of the existence of things or know anything of their real natures although we see and feel them and perceive them by all our senses dont we have to infer from this that there are no such things as physical or corporeal causes but that a spirit is the immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature can there be anything more extravagant than this yes there can it is infinitely more extravagant to say that an inert thing operates on the mind and an unperceiving thing causes our perceptions anyway the view that you for some reason find so extravagant is no more than the holy scriptures assert in a hundred places in them god is represented as the sole and immediate cause of all those effects that some heathens and philosophers customarily attribute to nature matter fate or some such unthinking agent there is no need for me to support this with particular citationsscripture is full of it you arent aware philonous that in making god the immediate cause of all the motions in nature you make him the author of murder sacrilege adultery and the like heinous sins in answer to that i remark first that a persons guilt is the same whether he performs an action with or without an instrument so if you think that god acts through the mediation of an instrument or occasion called matter you make him the author of sin just as much as i do through my view that he is immediate agent in all those operations that common people ascribe to nature i further remark that sin or wickedness does not consist in the outward physical action or movement but in something internalthe wills departing from the laws of reason and religion this is clearly so from the fact that killing an enemy in a battle or putting a criminal legally to death is not thought sinful although the outward acts are exactly the same as in murder sin therefore doesnt consist in the physical action so making god an immediate cause of all such actions isnt making him the author of sin lastly i have nowhere said that god is the only agent who produces all the motions in bodies true i have denied there are any agents other than spirits but this is quite consistent with assigning to thinking rational beings the use of limited powers in the production of motions these powers are indeed ultimately derived from god but they are immediately under the direction of the beings own wills and that is sufficient to entitle them to all the guilt of their actions but denying matter philonous or corporeal substance there is the sticking point you can never persuade me that this isnt in conflict with the universal sense of mankind if our dispute were to be settled by majority vote i am confident that you would surrender without counting the votes i would like both our positions to be fairly stated and submitted to the judgment of men who had plain common sense without the prejudices of a learned education let me be represented as one who trusts his senses who thinks he knows the things he sees and feels and has no doubts about their existence and you fairly present yourself armed with all your doubts your paradoxes and your scepticism and i shall willingly accept the decision of any unbiased person to me it is obvious that spirit is the only substance in which ideas can exist and everyone agrees that the objects we immediately perceive are ideas and noone can deny that sensible qualities are objects that we immediately perceive it is therefore evident there cant be any substratum of those qualities they can exist in a spirit not as qualities of it but as things perceived by it so i deny that there is any unthinking substratum of the objects of sense and that is the meaning of my denial that there is any material substance but if by material substance is meant only sensible body that which is seen and felt and i dare say that unphilosophical people mean no more then i am more certain of matters existence than you or any other philosopher claim to be if there is anything that turns people in general off from the views that i support it is the mistaken idea that i deny the reality of sensible things but it is you who are guilty of that not i so what they are really hostile to are your notions not mine i do therefore assertas something i am as certain of as i am of my own existencethat there are bodies or corporeal substances meaning the things i perceive by my senses most people will agree with this and will neither think nor care about the fate of those unknown natures and essences that some men are so fond of what do you say to this since according to you men judge the reality of things by their senses how can a man be mistaken in thinking that the moon is a plain shining surface about a foot in diameter or that a square tower seen at a distance is round or that an oar with one end in the water is crooked he is mistaken not with regard to the ideas he actually perceives but in what he infers from his present perceptions thus in the case of the oar what he immediately perceives by sight is certainly crooked and to that extent he is right but if he infers from this that when he takes the oar out of the water he will see the same crookedness or that it will affect his sense of touch as crooked things usually do in that he is mistaken likewise if from what he perceives in one place he infers that if he moves closer to the moon or tower he will still experience similar ideas he is mistaken but his mistake lies not in what he perceives immediately and at present for it is a manifest contradiction to suppose he could err about that but in the wrong judgment he makes concerning the ideas he thinks to be connected with the ones he immediately perceives or concerning the ideas thatjudging by what he perceives at presenthe thinks would be perceived in other circumstances the case is the same with regard to the copernican system we dont perceive any motion of the earth while we are standing on it but it would be wrong to infer from this that if we were placed at as great a distance from earth as we are now from the other planets we would not then perceive the earths motion i understand you and i have to admit that what you say is plausible enough still let me remind you of something tell me philonous werent you formerly as sure that matter exists as you are now that it does not i was but here lies the difference before my confidence was uncritically based on prejudice but my confidence now after enquiry rests on evidence after all it seems that our dispute is about words rather than things we agree in the thing but differ in the name it is obvious that we are affected with ideas from outside ourselves and it is equally obvious that there must be powers outside the mind corresponding to those ideas i dont say resembling them and as these powers cant exist by themselves we have to postulate some subject of themsome thing that has the powerswhich i call matter and you call spirit this is all the difference hylas is that powerful being or subject of powers extended it isnt but it has the power to cause the idea of extension in you in itself therefore it is unextended i grant it is it not also active without doubt otherwise how could we attribute powers to it now let me ask you two questions first does it conform to the usage of philosophers or of nonphilosophers to give the name matter to an unextended active being second isnt it ridiculously absurd to misapply names contrary to the common use of language well then let it not be called matter since you insist but some third nature distinct from matter and spirit for what reason do you have to call it spirit doesnt the notion of spirit imply that it is thinking as well as active and unextended my reason is as follows i want to have some notion or meaning in what i say but i have no notion of any action other than volition and i cant conceive of volition as being anywhere but in a spirit so when i speak of an active being i am obliged to mean a spirit besides it is quite obvious that a thing that can impart ideas to me must have ideas in itself and if a thing has ideas surely it must be a spirit i shall state the case differently to enable you to understand the point still more clearly if that is possible i assert as you do that since we are affected from outside ourselves we must accept that there are powers outside us in some being that is distinct from ourselves up to here we are in agreement but then we differ about what kind of powerful being it is i say it is spirit you say that it is matter or else some third kind of thingi dont know of what kind and nor do you here is how i prove it to be spirit from the effects i see produced i infer that there are actions so there are volitions so there must be a will again the things i perceive or things they are copied from must exist outside my mind but because they are ideas neither they nor things they are copied from can exist otherwise than in an understanding there is therefore an understanding but will and understanding constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit the powerful cause of my ideas is therefore something that it is strictly proper to call a spirit i suppose you think you have made the point very clear little suspecting that what you propose leads directly to a contradiction it is an absurdity to imagine any imperfection in god is it not without doubt to suffer pain is an imperfection it is are we not sometimes affected with pain and discomfort by some being other than ourselves we are and havent you said that that being is a spirit and is not that spirit god i agree but you have asserted that any ideas that we perceive from outside ourselves are in the mind that affects us it follows that the ideas of pain and discomfort are in god or in other words god suffers pain that is to say that there is an imperfection in the divine nature which you agreed was absurd so you are caught in a plain contradiction i dont question that god knows or understands all things including knowing what pain is he even knows every sort of painful sensation and what it is for his creatures to suffer pain but i positively deny that god though he knows and sometimes causes painful sensations in us can himself suffer pain we who are limited and dependent spirits are liable to sensory impressionscaused by an external agent and produced against our willsthat are sometimes painful and distressing but god cannot suffer anything or be affected with any painful sensation or indeed with any sensation at all because no external being can affect him he perceives nothing by sense as we do his will is absolute and independent causing all things and incapable of being thwarted or resisted by anything we are chained to a body that is to say our perceptions are connected with bodily motions by the law of our nature we undergo changes in our minds with every alteration in the nervous parts of our sensible perceptible body this sensible body is really nothing but a complex of qualities or ideas that have no existence other than through being perceived by a mind so that this connection of sensations with bodily motions comes down to a mere correspondence in the order of nature between two sets of ideas or immediately perceivable thingsthe set of ideas perceived by someones mind and the set constituting his body in contrast with this god is a pure spirit disengaged from all such correspondences or linkages according to laws of nature no bodily motions are accompanied by sensations of pain or pleasure in his mind to know everything knowable is certainly a perfection but to endure or suffer or feel anything through the senses is an imperfection the former i repeat fits god but not the latter god knows or has ideas but his ideas arent conveyed to him by sense as ours are what led you to think you saw an absurdity where really there is none was your failure to attend to this obvious difference between god and his creatures there is a well established scientific result which implies the existence of matter and you have ignored it throughout all this you havent considered the fact that the quantity of matter has been demonstrated rigorously proved to be proportional to the gravity of bodies and what can stand up against the force of a demonstration let me see how you demonstrate that point i lay it down for a principle that the quantities of motion in bodies are directly proportional to their velocities and the quantities of matter contained in them when the velocities of two bodies are equal therefore their quantities of motion are directly proportional to the quantity of matter in each but it has been found by experience that all bodies not counting small inequalities arising from the resistance of the air fall with an equal velocity and so the motion of falling bodies and consequently their gravity which is the cause or source of that motion is proportional to the quantity of matter they contain which is what i was to demonstrate you lay it down as a selfevident principle that the quantity of motion in any body is proportional to the velocity and matter taken together and this is used to prove a proposition from which the existence of matter is inferred isnt this arguing in a circle in the premise i only mean that the motion is proportional to the velocity jointly with the extension and solidity so i dont need to use the term matter in the premise but even if this is true it doesnt imply that gravity is proportional to matter in your philosophical sense of the word to get that conclusion you have to take it for granted in your premise that your unknown substratum or whatever else you call it is proportional to those sensible qualities velocity and quantity of motion but to suppose that is plainly assuming what was to be proved i readily grant that there is size and solidity or resistance perceived by the senses and i shant dispute the claim that gravity is proportional to those qualities what i do deny is that these qualities as perceived by us or the powers producing them exist in a material substratum you affirm this but despite your demonstration you havent yet proved it i shant press that point any further do you expect though to persuade me that natural scientists have been dreaming all through the years what becomes of all their hypotheses and explanations of the phenomena which presuppose the existence of matter what do you mean by the phenomena i mean the appearances that i perceive by my senses and the appearances perceived by the sensesarent they ideas i have told you so a hundred times therefore to explain the phenomena is to show how we come to be affected with ideas in the particular manner and order in which they are imprinted on our senses is it not it is now if you can prove that any scientist has explained the production of any one idea in our minds with the help of matter i shall capitulate and regard all that i have said against matter as nothing but if you cant you will get nowhere by urging the explanation of phenomena it is easy to understand that a being endowed with knowledge and will should produce or display ideas but i can never understand how a being that is utterly destitute of knowledge and will could produce ideas or in any way to affect a mind even if we had some positive conception of matter knew its qualities and could comprehend its existence it would still be so far from explaining things that it would itself be the most inexplicable thing in the world from all this however it doesnt follow that scientists have been doing nothing for by observing and reasoning about connections of ideas they discover the laws and methods of nature which is a useful and interesting branch of knowledge all the same can it be supposed god would deceive all mankind do you imagine that he would have induced the whole world to believe in the existence of matter if there was no such thing i dont think you will affirm that every widespread opinion arising from prejudice or passion or thoughtlessness may be blamed on god as the author of it we arent entitled to lay at his door an opinion of ours unless either he has shown it to us by supernatural revelation or it is so evident to our natural faculties which were formed and given to us by god that we couldnt possibly withhold our assent from it but where is the supernatural revelation of matter or where is the evidence that compels us to believe in it indeed what is the evidence that matter taken for something distinct from what we perceive by our senses is thought to exist by all mankind or indeed by any except a few philosophers who dont know what they are saying your question presupposes that these points are clear when you have made them so i shall regard myself as obliged to give you another answer in the meantime let it suffice that i tell you that i dont suppose that god has deceived mankind at all but the novelty philonous the novelty there lies the danger new notions should always be discouraged they unsettle mens minds and nobody knows what they will lead to i cant imagine why rejecting a notion that has no basis in sense or in reason or in divine authority should be thought to unsettle mens hold on beliefs that are grounded on all or any of these i freely grant that new opinions about government and religion are dangerous and ought to be discountenanced but is there any such reason why they should be discouraged in philosophy making anything known that was unknown before introduces a new opinion and if all such new opinions had been forbidden what a notable progress men would have made in the arts and sciences but it isnt my concern to plead for novelties and paradoxes that the qualities we perceive are not in the objects that we mustnt believe our senses that we know nothing of the real nature of things and can never be assured even that they exist that real colours and sounds are nothing but certain unknown shapes and motions that motions are in themselves neither swift nor slow that bodies have absolute extensions without any particular size or shape that a stupid thoughtless and inactive thing operates on a spirit that the tiniest particle of a body contains countless extended parts these are the novelties these are the strange notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted judgment of all mankind and having once been accepted embarrass the mind with endless doubts and difficulties and it is against these and their like that i try to vindicate common sense it is true that in doing this i may have to express myself in some roundabout ways and to use uncommon turns of speech but once my notions are thoroughly understood what is strangest in them will be found to come down merely to this it is absolutely impossible and a plain contradiction to suppose that any unthinking being should exist without being perceived by a mind and if this view is found to be strange it is a shame that it should be so in our age and in a christian country i shant question what you say about the difficulties that other opinions may be liable to but it is your business to defend your own opinion can anything be more obvious than that you support changing all things into ideas yes you who are not ashamed to charge me with scepticism this is so obvious that there is no denying it you have me wrong what i support is not changing things into ideas but rather ideas into things since those immediate objects of perception which you say are only appearances of things are what i take to be the real things themselves things say what you like its certain that all you leave us with are the empty forms of things their mere outsides that strike the senses what you call the empty forms and outsides of things seem to me to be the things themselves and they arent empty or incomplete except on your supposition that matter is an essential part of all bodily things so you and i agree that we perceive only sensible forms but we differ in that you maintain them to be empty appearances while i think they are real beings in short you dont trust your senses i do trust mine you say that you believe your senses and you seem to congratulate yourself on agreeing with common people about this according to you therefore the true nature of a thing is discovered by the senses if so what is the source of the sensory disagreement that we experience why do different ways of perceivingeg sight and touchindicate different shapes for the same object and if the true nature of a body can be discovered by the naked eye why should a microscope enable us to know it better strictly speaking hylas we dont see the same object that we feel and the object perceived through the microscope isnt the same one that was perceived by the naked eye but if every variation were thought sufficient to constitute a new kind or new individual language would be made useless by the sheer number of names or by confusions amongst them therefore to avoid this and other inconveniences youll easily see what they are if you think about it men in their thought and language treat as one thing a number of ideas that are observed to have some connection in nature either occurring together or in sequence although the ideas are certainly distinct from one another because they are perceived through different senses or through one sense at different times or in different circumstances so when i see a thing and then proceed to examine it by my other senses im not trying to understand better the same object that i had seen that cant be what i am doing because the object of one sense cant be perceived by the other senses and when i look through a microscope it isnt so as to perceive more clearly what i had already perceived with my bare eyes because the objects perceived in these two ways are quite different from one another in each case all i want is to know what ideas are connected together and the more a man knows of the connection of ideas the more he is said to know of the nature of things if our ideas are variable and our senses are not always affected with the same appearanceswhat of it it doesnt follow that they arent to be trusted or that they are inconsistent either with themselves or with anything else except for your preconceived notion that each name stands for i know not what single unchanged unperceivable real nature a prejudice that seems to have arisen from a failure to understand the common language that people use when speaking of several distinct ideas as united into one thing by the mind there is reason to suspect that other erroneous views of the philosophers are due to the same source they founded their theories not so much on notions as on words which were invented by the common people merely for convenience and efficiency in the common actions of life without any regard to theories i think i follow you you hold that the ideas we perceive by our senses are not real things but images or copies of them so our knowledge is real only to the extent that our ideas are the true representations of those originals but as these supposed originals or real things are in themselves unknown we cant know how far our ideas resemble them or indeed whether they resemble them at all so we cant be sure that we have any real knowledge furthermore while the supposed real things remain unchanged our ideas keep changing so they cant all be true copies of the real things and if some are and others are not we cant tell which are which this plunges us yet deeper into uncertainty again when we think about it we cant conceive how any idea or anything like an idea could have an absolute existence out of any mind from which it follows according to your views that we cant conceive how there should be any real thing in nature because you say that real things are like ideas the result of all this is that we are hopelessly lost in scepticism now let me ask you four questions first doesnt all this scepticism arise from your relating ideas to certain absolutely existing unperceived substances as their originals secondly are you informed either by sense or reason of the existence of those unknown originals and if you are not isnt it absurd to suppose that they exist thirdly when you look into it do you find that there is anything distinctly conceived or meant by the absolute or external existence of unperceiving substances lastly having considered the premises that i have put to you isnt it wisest to follow nature trust your senses lay aside all anxious thoughts about unknown natures or substances and join the common people in taking the things that are perceived by the senses to be real things just now i am not inclined to answer your questions i would much rather see how you can answer mine arent the objects perceived by one persons senses also perceivable by others who are present if there were a hundred more people here they would all see the garden the trees and flowers as i see them but they dont experience in the same way the ideas that i form in my imagination doesnt this make a difference between the former sort of objects and the latter i agree that it does and i have never denied that the objects of sense are different from those of imagination but what would you infer from this you cant say that sensible objects exist unperceived because they are perceived by many people i admit that i cant make anything of that objection of mine but it has led me to another isnt it your opinion that all we perceive through our senses are the ideas existing in our minds it is but the idea that is in my mind cant be in yours or in any other mind so doesnt it follow from your principles that no two people can see the same thing and isnt this highly absurd if the term same be given its common meaning it is certain and not at all in conflict with the principles i maintain that different persons may perceive the same thing and that the same thing or idea can exist in different minds the meanings of words are assigned by us and since men customarily apply the word same where no distinction or variety is perceived and i dont claim to alter their perceptions it follows that as men have sometimes said several people saw the same thing they may continue to talk like that in similar situations without deviating either from correctness of language or the truth of things but if the term same is used in a meaning given to it by philosophers who claim to have an abstracted notion of identity then in that sense it may or may not be possible for different people to perceive the same thingdepending on their various definitions of this notion for it isnt yet agreed what that philosophical identity consists in but whether philosophers shall think fit to call a thing the same or not is of small importance i think let us suppose a group of men together all having the same faculties and consequently affected in similar ways by their senses but with no use of language there is no doubt that they would agree in their perceptions but when they came to the use of speech they might go different ways in their use of same some of them impressed by the uniformness of what was perceived might speak of the same thing while others struck by the diversity of the people whose perceptions were in question might speak of different things but cant anyone see that all the dispute is about a wordnamely a dispute over whether what is perceived by different people can have the term same applied to it or suppose a house whose outer walls remain unaltered while the rooms are all pulled down and new ones built in their place if you were to say that we still have the same house and i said it wasnt the same wouldnt we nevertheless perfectly agree in our thoughts about the house considered in itself wouldnt all the difference consist in a sound if you were to say that in that case we do differ in our notions because your idea of the house includes the simple abstracted idea of identity whereas mine does not i would tell you that i dont know what you mean by that abstracted idea of identity and i would invite you to look into your own thoughts and make sure that you understood yourselfwhy so silent hylas arent you satisfied yet that men can dispute about identity and nonidentity without any real difference in their thoughts and opinions apart from names take this further thought with you that this point still stands whether matter exists or not for the materialists themselves admit that what we immediately perceive by our senses are our own ideas so your difficultythat no two see the same thingholds as much against the materialists as against me but they suppose that an idea represents and copies an external thing and they can say truly that several people perceive the same thing meaning that their ideas all copy a single external thing you earlier gave up on those things that ideas were said to copy but let that pass anyway on my principles also you can suppose that ideas are copies of something external by which i mean external to ones own mind though indeed it must be supposed to exist in that mind which includes all things this thingthatiscopied serves all the ends of identityproviding a basis for saying they perceived the same thingas well as if it existed out of a mind and i am sure you wont say that it is less intelligible than the other you have indeed clearly satisfied me that there is basically no difficulty in this point or that if there is it counts equally against both opinions but something that counts equally against two contradictory opinions cant be a disproof of either of them i agree but after all philonous when i consider the substance of what you say against scepticism it amounts to no more than this we are sure that we really see hear feel in a word we are sure that we are affected with sensible impressions and what more should we be concerned with i see this cherry i feel it i taste it and i am sure nothing cannot be seen or felt or tasted so the cherry is not nothing and it is therefore real take away the sensations of softness moisture redness tartness and you take away the cherry since it is not a thing distinct from sensations a cherryi repeatis nothing but a heap of sensible impressions or ideas perceived by various senses these ideas are united into one thing or have one name given to them by the mind because they are observed to accompany each other thus when the palate is affected with a certain taste the sight is affected with a red colour the sense of touch with roundness softness etc and when i see and feel and taste in certain particular ways i am sure that the cherry exists or is real because i dont think its reality is anything apart from those sensations but if by the word cherry you mean an unknown nature distinct from all those sensible qualities and by its existence you mean something distinct from its being perceived then indeed i agree that neither you nor i nor anyone else can be sure that it exists but what would you say philonous if i brought the very same reasons against the existence of sensible things in a mind that you have offered against their existing in a material substratum when i see your reasons ill tell you what i have to say to them is the mind extended or unextended unextended without doubt do you say the things you perceive are in your mind they are again have i not heard you speak of sensible impressions i believe you may have explain to me now philonous how there can possibly be room for all those trees and houses to exist in your mind can extended things be contained in something that has no size because it is unextended and are we to imagine impressions made on a thing that has no solidity obviously not you cant say that objects are in your mind as books are in your study or that things are impressed or imprinted on your mind as the shape of a seal is imprinted on wax in what sense therefore are we to understand those expressions explain this to me if you can and i shall then be able to answer all those questions you earlier put to me about my substratum come on hylas when i speak of objects as existing in the mind or imprinted on the senses i dont mean these in the crude literal sense as when bodies are said to exist in a place or a seal to make an impression on wax i mean only that the mind comprehends or perceives them and that it is affected from outside or by some being other than itself this is my explanation of your difficulty i would like to know how it can help to make intelligible your thesis of an unperceiving material substratum no if thats all there is to it i admit that i dont see what use can be made of it but are you not guilty of some misuse of language in this none at all i have merely followed what is authorized by common custom which as you know is what sets the rules for language for nothing is more usual than for philosophers to speak of the immediate objects of the understanding as things existing in the mind and this fits with the general analogy of language most mental operations are signified by words borrowed from sensible things as can be seen in the terms comprehend contain understand reflect bounce back look inward discourse etc when these are applied to the mind they must not be taken in their crude original sense the word discourse comes from latin meaning run to and fro and in berkeleys day it could mean reasoning you have i admit satisfied me about this but there still remains one great difficulty which i dont see how you can overcome indeed it is of such importance that even if you can solve all others if you cant find a solution for this difficulty you mustnt expect to make a convert out of me let me know this mighty difficulty the scriptural account of the creation appears to me to be utterly incompatible with your notions moses tells us of a creation a creation of what of ideas no certainly but of things of real things solid corporeal substances get your principles to conform with this and i shall perhaps agree with you about them in general moses mentions the sun moon and stars earth and sea plants and animals i dont question that all these do really exist and were in the beginning created by god if by ideas you mean fictions and fancies of the mind then the sun moon etc are no ideas if by ideas you mean immediate objects of the understanding or sensible things that cant exist unperceived or out of a mind then those things are ideas but it matters little whether you call them ideas or not that difference is only about a name and whether that name be retained or rejected the sense the truth and reality of things continues the same in common talk the objects of our senses are not called ideas but things youll have no quarrel with me if you go on calling them things provided you dont attribute to them any absolute external existence so i accept that the creation was a creation of things of real things this isnt in the least inconsistent with my principles as is evident from what i have just been saying and would have been evident to you without that if you hadnt forgotten what i so often said before as for solid corporeal substances please show where moses makes any mention of them and if they should be mentioned by him or any other inspired writer it would still be up to you to show that in such texts those words were not used in the common meaning as referring to things falling under our senses but in the philosophical meaning as standing for matter or an unknown something with an absolute mindindependent existence when you have proved these points then and not till then you may bring the authority of moses into our dispute it is useless to dispute about a point that is so clear i am content to refer it to your own conscience cant you see that your views conflict in a special way with moses account of the creation if the first chapter of genesis can be given any possible sense that makes it square with my principles as well as with any others then that chapter has no special conflict with mine and any such sense can be conceived by you because you believe what i believe all you can conceive apart from spirits are ideas and their existence i dont deny and you like me dont claim that they exist outside the mind please let me see any sense in which you can understand that chapter why i imagine that if i had been present at the creation i would have seen things come into existencethat is become perceptiblein the order described by moses i have always believed moses account of the creation and i dont find that my manner of believing it has altered in any way when things are said to begin or end their existence we mean this with regard not to god but to his creatures all objects are eternally known by god or the same thing have an eternal existence in his mind but when things that were previously imperceptible to creatures are by a decree of god made perceptible to them then are they said to come into existence in the sense that they begin a relative existence with respect to created minds so when i read moses account of the creation i understand that the various parts of the world gradually became perceivable to finite spirits that were endowed with proper faculties so that when such spirits were present the things were in truth perceived by them this is the literal obvious sense suggested to me by the words of the holy scripture and in it there is no mention and no thought of substratum instrument occasion or absolute existence and if you look into it i am sure you will find that most plain honest men who believe the creation never think of those things any more than i do what metaphysical sense you may understand the creation story in only you can tell but philonous you seem not to be aware of a terrific problem confronting you arising from the fact that according to you created things in the beginning had only a relative existence and thus a hypothetical existence that is to say they existed if there were men to perceive them you dont allow them any actuality of absolute existence that would have enabled god to create them and not taken the further step of creating men so dont you have to say that its plainly impossible that inanimate things were created before man was and isnt this directly contrary to moses account in answer to that i say first created beings might begin to exist in the mind of other created intelligences besides men to prove any contradiction between moses account and my notions you must first show that there was no other order of finite created spirits in existence before men for my second reply let us think of the creation as it was at the end of the fourth day a collection of plants of all sorts produced by an invisible power in a desert where nobody was present i say that this way of thinking about the creation is consistent with my principles since they deprive you of nothing sensible and nothing imaginable that it exactly suits with the common natural uncorrupted notions of mankind that it brings out the dependence of all things on god and consequently has all the good effect or influence which that important article of our faith could possibly have in making men humble thankful and resigned to their creator i say furthermore that in this naked conception of things with words stripped off you wont find any notion of what you call the actuality of absolute existence you may indeed raise a dust with those terms and so pointlessly lengthen our dispute but i beg you to look calmly into your own thoughts and then tell me if they arent useless and unintelligible jargon i admit that i have no very clear notion annexed to them but what do you say to this dont you make the existence of sensible things consist in their being in a mind and werent all things eternally in the mind of god didnt they therefore exist from all eternity according to you how could something that was eternal be created in time can anything be clearer or better reasoned than this dont you also think that god knew all things from eternity i do consequently they always had an existence in the divine intellect this i acknowledge by your own admission therefore nothing is new nothing begins to be in respect of the mind of god so we are agreed on that point then what are we to make of the creation cant we understand it to have been entirely in respect of finite spirits on that understanding of it things with regard to us can properly be said to begin their existence or be created when god decreed they should become perceptible to intelligent creatures in the order and manner which he then established and which we now call the laws of nature you may call this a relative or hypothetical existence if you please but so long as it supplies us with the most natural obvious and literal sense of moses history of the creation so long as it answers all the religious ends of that great article of faith in a word so long as you can assign no other sense or meaning in place of it why should we reject this is it to comply with a ridiculous sceptical desire to make everything nonsense and unintelligible i am sure you cant say it is for the glory of god for even if it were possible and conceivable that the physical world should have an absolute existence outside the mind of god as well as of the minds of all created spirits how could this display either the immensity or the omniscience of the deity or the necessary and immediate dependence of all things on him wouldnt it indeed seem rather to detract from those attributes well let us look into this decree of gods that things should become perceptible isnt it clear philonous that either god carried out that decree from all eternity or at some particular time he began to will what he hadnt actually willed before but only planned to will if the former then there could be no creation or beginning of existence for finite things if the latter then we must think that something new happened to god which implies a sort of change and all change points to imperfection please think what you are doing isnt it obvious that this objection counts equally against a creation in any sense indeed that it counts against every other act of gods that we can discover by the light of nature we cant conceive any act of gods otherwise than as performed in time and having a beginning god is a being of transcendent and unlimited perfections so finite spirits cant understand his nature it isnt to be expected therefore that any man whether materialist or immaterialist should have exactly correct notions of the deity his attributes and his ways of doing things so if you want to infer anything against me your difficulty mustnt be drawn from the inadequateness of our conceptions of the divine nature which is unavoidable on any system it must rather come from my denial of matter of which there isnt one word said or hinted in what you have just objected i have to agree that the only difficulties you have to clear up are ones that arise from the nonexistence of matter and are special to that thesis you are right about that but i simply cant bring myself to think there is no such special conflict between the creation and your opinion though i am not clear about where exactly it is what more do you want dont i acknowledge a twofold state of things the one copied or natural the other copiedfrom and eternal the former was created in time the latter existed from everlasting in the mind of god isnt this in harmony with what theologians generally say is anything more than this necessary in order to conceive the creation but you suspect some special conflict though you cannot locate it to take away all possibility of doubt about all this just consider this one point either you cant conceive the creation on any hypothesis whatsoever in which case you have no ground for dislike or complaint against my thesis in particular or you can conceive the creation and in that case why not conceive it on my principles since that would not take away anything conceivable my principles have all along allowed you the full scope of sense imagination and reason so anything that you could previously apprehend either immediately by your senses or mediately by inferences from your senses anything you could perceive imagine or understand remains still with you on my principles if therefore the notion you have of the creation by other principles is intelligible you still have it on mine if it isnt intelligible i dont think it is a notion at all and so the loss of it is no loss and indeed it seems to me quite clear that the supposition of mattersomething perfectly unknown and inconceivablecant enable us to conceive anything and i hope i dont need to prove to you that the inference from the creation is inconceivable without matter to matter exists is no good if the existence of matter doesnt make the creation conceivable i admit philonous you have almost satisfied me on this point of the creation i wonder why you arent entirely satisfied you tell me indeed of an inconsistency between moses history and immaterialism but you dont know where it lies is this reasonable hylas can you expect me to solve a difficulty without knowing what it is but setting that aside wouldnt anyone think you are sure that the received notions of materialists are consistent with holy scripture and so i am ought the historical part of scripture to be understood in a plain obvious sense or in a sense that is metaphysical and out of the way in the plain sense doubtless when moses speaks of plants earth water etc as having been created by god dont you think that what this suggests to every unphilosophical reader are the sensible things commonly signified by those words i cant help thinking so and doesnt the doctrine of materialists deny a real existence to all ideas that is all things perceived by sense i have already agreed to this according to them therefore the creation was not the creation of sensible things that have only a relative existence but of certain unknown natures that have an absolute existenceso that they could exist even if there were no spirit to perceive them true isnt it evident therefore that the friends of matter destroy the plain obvious sense of moses with which their notions are utterly inconsistent and instead of it force on us i know not what something equally unintelligible to themselves and me i cant contradict you moses tells us of a creation a creation of what of unknown essences of occasions or substratums no certainly but of things that are obvious to the senses you must first reconcile this with your notions if you want me to be reconciled to them i see you can attack me with my own weapons then as to absolute existence was there ever known a more povertystricken notion than that it is something so abstracted and unintelligible that you have frankly admitted to being unable to conceive it much less to explain anything with its help but even if we allow that matter exists and that the notion of absolute existence is as clear as daylight has this ever been known to make the creation more credible on the contrary hasnt it provided the atheists and infidels down through the centuries with their most plausible argument against a creation this thesis a corporeal substance which has an absolute existence outside the minds of spirits was produced out of nothing by the mere will of a spirit has been seen as so contrary to all reason so impossible and absurd that not only the most celebrated among the ancients but even a variety of modern and christian philosophers have thought matter not to have been created at all but to have existed for ever along with god put these points together and then judge whether materialism disposes men to believe in the creation of things i admit philonous that i dont think it does this creation objection is the last one i can think of and i have to admit that you have sufficiently answered it along with the rest all that remains for me to overcome is a sort of unaccountable resistance that i find in myself towards your notions when a man is swayed to one side of a question without knowing why dont you think that this must be the effect of prejudice which always accompanies old and rooted notions in this respect indeed i cant deny that the belief in matter has very much the advantage over the contrary opinion in the minds of educated men i admit that that seems to be right well then as a counterbalance to this weight of prejudice let us throw into the scale the great advantages that arise from the belief in immaterialism in regard to both religion and human learning the existence of a god and the imperishable nature of the soul those great articles of religion arent they proved with the clearest and most immediate evidence when i say the existence of a god i dont mean an obscure general cause of things of which we have no conception but god in the strict and proper sense of the word a being whose spirituality omnipresence providence omniscience infinite power and goodness are as conspicuous as the existence of sensible things of which despite the fallacious claims and pretended doubts of sceptics there is no more reason to doubt than of our own existence then with relation to human knowledge in natural science what intricacies what obscurities what contradictions has the belief in matter led men into to say nothing of the numberless disputes about its extent continuity homogeneity gravity divisibility etc dont they claim to explain everything in terms of bodies operating on bodies according to the laws of motion and yet can they understand how one body might move another furthermore even if there were no difficulty in reconciling the notion of an inert being such as matter with the notion of a cause or in conceiving how a quality might pass from one body to another this being one theory about how one body can move another namely by passing some motion along to it yet by all their strained thoughts and extravagant suppositions have the materialists been able to understand the mechanical production of any one animal or plant body can they through the laws of motion account for sounds tastes smells or colours or for the regular course of events have they through physical principles accounted for the intricate ways in which even the most inconsiderable parts of the universe hang together if on the other hand we set aside matter and corporeal causes and admit only the effectiveness of an allperfect mind dont all the effects of nature become easy and intelligible if the phenomena are nothing but ideas the choice is obvious god is a spirit but matter is unintelligent and unperceiving if the phenomena point to an unlimited power in their cause god is active and omnipotent but matter is an inert mass if the order regularity and usefulness of the effects of nature can never be sufficiently admired god is infinitely wise and provident but matter doesnt have plans and designs these surely are great advantages in physics not to mention that the belief in a distant god naturally disposes men to be slack in their moral actions which they would be more cautious about if they thought god to be immediately present and acting on their minds without the interposition of matter or unthinking second causes then in metaphysics what difficulties concerning thinghood in the abstract substantial forms hylarchic principles plastic natures substance and accident principle of individuation the possibility of matters thinking the origin of ideas the question of how two independent substances as widely different as spirit and matter could act on each other what difficulties i say and what endless treatises concerning these and countless other similar points do we escape by supposing only spirits and ideas even mathematics becomes much easier and clearer if we take away the absolute existence of extended things the most shocking paradoxes and intricate speculations in the mathematical sciences depend on the infinite divisibility of finite extended things and that depends on the supposition of absolutely existing extended things but what need is there to insist on particular sciences isnt the opposition to all systematic knowledge whatsoeverthat frenzy of the ancient and modern scepticsbuilt on the same foundation can you produce so much as one argument against the reality of bodies or on behalf of that professed utter ignorance of their natures which doesnt presuppose that their reality consists in an external absolute existence once that presupposition is made the objections from the change of colours in a pigeons neck or the broken appearance of an oar in the water do have weight but objections like those vanish if we dont maintain the existence of absolute external originals but place the reality of things in ideas although these ideas are fleeting and changeable they are changed not at random but according to the fixed order of nature for it is thatthe orderliness of our sequences of ideasthat the constancy and truth of things consists in that is what secures all the concerns of life and distinguishes what is real from the irregular visions of the imagination i agree with everything youve just said and must admit that nothing can incline me to embrace your opinion more than the advantages that i see come with it i am by nature lazy and this accepting immaterialism would greatly simplify knowledge what doubts what hypotheses what labyrinths of confusion what fields of disputation what an ocean of false learning can be avoided by that single notion of immaterialism is there now anything further to be done you may remember that you promised to accept whatever opinion appeared on examination to be the most agreeable to common sense and furthest from scepticism this by your own admission is the opinion that denies matter or the absolute existence of bodily things and we have gone further this opinion has been proved in several ways viewed from different angles pursued in its consequences and defended against all objections to it can there be a greater evidence of its truth or could it have all the marks of a true opinion and yet be false i admit that right now i am entirely satisfied in all respects but how can i be sure that i shall go on fully assenting to your opinion and that no new objection or difficulty will turn up tell me hylas when in other cases a point has been clearly proved do you withhold your assent on account of objections or difficulties it may be liable to when you are confronted with a mathematical demonstration rigorously valid proof do you hold out against it because of the difficulties involved in the doctrine of incommensurable quantities of the angle of contact of the asymptotes to curves or the like or will you disbelieve the providence of god because there are some particular things which you dont know how to reconcile with it if there are difficulties in immaterialism there are at the same time direct and evident proofs of it but for the existence of matter there isnt a single proof and there are far more numerous and insurmountable objections count against it anyway where are those mighty difficulties you insist on alas you dont know where or what they are theyre merely something that may possibly turn up in the future if this entitles you to withhold your full assent you should never assent to any proposition however free from objections it may be and however clearly and solidly demonstrated you have satisfied me philonous as armament against all future objections do bear in mind that something bearing equally hard on two contradictory opinions cannot be a proof against either of them so whenever any difficulty in immaterialism occurs to you see if you can find a solution for it on the hypothesis of the materialists dont be deceived by words but test your own thoughts and if you dont find it easier with the help of materialism it obviously cant be an objection against immaterialism if you had followed this rule all along you would probably have spared yourself much trouble in objecting because none of your objections conforms to the rule i challenge you to show one of your difficulties that is explained by matter indeed one that is not made even worse by supposing matter and consequently counts against materialism rather than for it in each particular case you should consider whether the difficulty arises from the nonexistence of matter if it doesnt then arguing from it to the falsity of immaterialism is arguing from a premise to a conclusion that has nothing to do with itno better than arguing from extension is infinitely divisible to god does not have foreknowledge and yet if you think back i believe you will find this to have been often if not always the case in our conversation be careful also not to argue by begging the question that is giving an argument that at the outset assumes the truth of the conclusion one is apt to say the unknown substances ought to be regarded as real things rather than the ideas in our minds and for all we know the unthinking external substance may operate as a cause or instrument in the production of our ideas but doesnt this assume that there are such external substances and isnt this begging the question but above all things you should beware of misleading yourself by that common fallacy which is called mistaking the questionthat is offering against one proposition an argument which really counts only against a quite different proposition you often talked as if you thought i maintained the nonexistence of sensible things whereas in truth noone can be more thoroughly assured of their existence than i am and it is you who doubtno it is you who positively denythat they exist everything that is seen felt heard or in any way perceived by the senses is a real being according to the principles i embrace but not according to the principles that used to be yours remember that the matter you used to defend is an unknown something if indeed it can even be called a something which is completely stripped of all sensible qualities and cant be perceived through the senses or grasped by the mind remember i say that your matter is not any object that is hard or soft hot or cold blue or white round or square etc for i affirm that all these things do exist though i do indeed deny that they exist in any way except by being perceived or that they exist out of all minds whatsoever think about these points consider them attentively and keep them in view otherwise you wont be clear about the state of the question and in that case your objections will always be wide of the mark and instead of counting against my views they may possibly be directed as more than once they have been against yours i have to admit philonous that nothing seems to have kept me from agreeing with you more than this same mistaking the question that you have just warned me against when you deny matter i am tempted at first glance to think that you are denying the things we see and feel but on reflection i find there is no ground for that how about keeping the word matter and applying it to sensible things this could be done without any change in your views and believe me it would reconcile your views to some people who are upset more by your use of words than by your opinions with all my heart retain the word matter and apply it to the objects of sense if you please but dont credit them with existing apart from being perceived i shant quarrel with you over a word matter and material substance are terms introduced by philosophers and as used by them they imply a sort of independence or an existence distinct from being perceived by a mind but common people dont use these terms or if they do it is to signify the immediate objects of sense so one would think that so long as the names of all particular things are retained and also such terms as sensible substance body and stuff the word matter would never be missed in common talk and in philosophical discourses it seems best to leave it out altogether since the use of that general confused termmore perhaps than any other one factorhas favoured and strengthened the depraved tendency of the mind towards atheism well now philonous since i am content to give up the notion of an unthinking substance exterior to the mind i think you should allow me the privilege of using the word matter as i please to signify a collection of sensible qualities existing only in the mind i freely grant that strictly speaking there is no other substance than spirit but i have been accustomed to the term matter for so long that i dont know how to get on without it to say there is no matter in the world is still shocking to me whereas to say there is no matter if by matter is meant an unthinking substance existing outside the mind but if by matter is meant some sensible thing whose existence consists in being perceived then there is matter comes across quite differently and this formulation will bring men to your notions with little difficulty for after all the controversy about matter in the strict sense of matter is not a dispute between you and ordinary folk it lies altogether between you and the philosophers whose principles are admittedly nowhere near so natural or so agreeable to the common sense of mankind and to holy scripture as yours are all our desires are directed towards gaining happiness or avoiding misery but what have happiness or misery joy or grief pleasure or pain to do with absolute existence or with unknown entities abstracted from all relation to us it is obvious that things concern us only insofar as they are pleasing or displeasing and they can please or displease only to the extent that they are perceived beyond that we are not concerned and in this respect you leave things as you found them but still there is something new in this doctrine of yours it is clear to me that i dont now think with the philosophers nor do i entirely think with the common people i would like to know where i stand nowto know precisely what you have added to my former notions or altered in them i dont claim to be a setterup of new notions all im trying to do is bring together and place in a clearer light a truth that used to be shared between the common people and the philosophers the former being of the opinion that the things they immediately perceive are the real things and the latter that the things they immediately perceive are ideas which exist only in the mind these two notions when put together constitute the substance of what i advance for a long time i have distrusted my senses i thought i saw things by a dim light and through false glasses now the glasses are removed and a new light breaks in on my understanding i am clearly convinced that i see things as they are and am no longer troubled about their unknown natures or absolute existence this is the state i find myself in at present though indeed i dont yet fully grasp the line of argument that brought me to it you set out on the same principles that academics sceptics in ancient greece cartesians and similar sects usually do and for a long time it looked as if you were advancing their philosophical scepticism but in the end your conclusions are directly opposite to theirs hylas look at the water of that fountain how it is forced upwards in a round column to a certain height at which it breaks and falls back into the basin from which it rose its ascent as well as its descent come from the same uniform law or principle of gravitation in just that way the same principles which at first view lead to scepticism then when pursued to a certain point bring men back to common sense alciphron or the minute philosopher a defence of the christian religion against the socalled freethinkers george berkeley contents first dialogue freethinking and the general good second dialogue the ethics of mandeville third dialogue the ethics of shaftesbury fourth dialogue the truth of theism fifth dialogue the utility of christianity sixth dialogue the truth of christianity seventh dialogue the truth of christianity i want to consider the various things that a freethinker can beatheist libertine fanatic scorner critic metaphysician fatalist scepticbut you shouldnt think that according to me every individual freethinker is all of these all i am saying is that each item on that list characterizes some freethinkers you may think that no freethinker is an atheist it has often been said that although there are admittedly some atheists who claim to be philosophical theorists noone is really an atheist as a matter of philosophical theory i know these things are said but i am well assured that one of the most noted writers against christianity in our times claims to have discovered a demonstration knockdown proof that there is no god if you take the trouble to consult conversation and books to inform yourself about the principles and tenets of our modern freethinkers im sure youll find that every item on my list is true to life i am not writing only against books dont think that the freethinking authors are being misrepresented if every notion of alciphron or lysicles is not found precisely in what the authors have written we can expect that a man in a private conversation will speak more openly than others write to improve on the hints given by authors of books and draw conclusions from their principles whatever they may claim i believe that all those who write either explicitly or by insinuation against the dignity freedom and immortality of the human soul can on that account be fairly accused of unsettling the principles of morality and destroying the means of making men rationally virtuous we can expect from that direction a lot that is harmful to the interests of virtue a certain admired writer has expressed the view that the cause of virtue is likely to suffer less from those who mock it than from those who tenderly nurse it because the nurses are apt to bundle it up too warmly and kill it with excess of care and cherishing and also make it a mercenary thing by talking so much of its rewards i leave it to you to decide whether this is a fair statement of the situation the dialogues are reported in a long letter written to a friend by a fictional gentleman named dionall the names are greek his opening words echo berkeleys situation when composing this work he was in rhode island facing the probable failure of his plan to start a college in bermuda the dialogues however are located in a quietly rural part of england first dialogue monday i was optimistic enough to believe that by now id have been able to send you an agreeable account of the success of the plan that brought me to this remote corner of the country but all i could report are the details of how it went wrong and i prefer instead to entertain you with some amusing incidents that have helped to soothe me during the inevitable and unforeseeable difficulties that i have encountered events are not in our power but we can always make good use even of the worst and i have to admit that the way this affair went and the outcome of it gave me an opportunity for reflections that help to compensate for my great loss of time and my trouble and expense a mind that is free to reflect on its own processes if it doesnt produce anything useful to the world usually manages to entertain itself for the past several months i have enjoyed that kind of freedom and leisure in this distant place far from that great whirlpool of business struggle and pleasure that is called the world and my enjoyment of this peaceful place has been greatly increased by the conversation and good qualities of my host euphranorhes a philosopher and a farmer two roles that are not so inconsistent in nature as you might think from the time he left the university euphranor has lived in this small town where he has a good house with a hundred acres of land adjoining it after the work he has put into improving the land it provides him with a comfortable income he has a good collection of books mainly old ones left to him by a clergyman uncle who brought him up and the business of his farm doesnt hinder him from making good use of it he has read much and thought more his health and strength of body helping him not to become mentally weary he thinks he can carry on his studies better in the field than in his study and his mind is seldom idle while he prunes the trees follows the plough or looks after his flocks in the house of this honest friend i became acquainted with a wealthy and distinguished friend of euphranors named crito his anglican parish church is in our town one sunday last summer when he was dining at euphranors i asked after his guests whom we had seen at church with him the previous sunday they are both well said crito but having dropped in at the church that one time just to see what sort of congregation our parish could provide they had no further curiosity about the church and so chose to stay at home what said euphranor are they presbyterians no replied crito they are freethinkers euphranor who had never met any member of that species or sect of men and knew little of their writings wanted to know what their principles were what system they accepted that is more than i can tell you said crito their writers have different opinions some go further and state their position more openly than others but the best way to learn about the current ideas of the sect is to talk with those who declare themselves to be freethinkers your curiosity could now be satisfied if you and dion would spend a week at my house with these guests of mine who seem very ready to declare and propagate their opinions alciphron is in his forties and is no stranger to men or to books i knew him first when we were both training as lawyers in london when he came into a rich inheritance he gave up his law studies and travelled through the civilized parts of europe after his return he lived among the amusements of london but he began to find them stale and insipid which threw him into a sort of irritable laziness my other guest lysicles pronounced liesuhclees is a near relative of mine he is a quick and clever young gentleman with some general knowledge about bookish matters after he had completed his formal education and seen a little of the world he became friends with men of pleasure and freethinkers berkeleys exact phrase which i fear has greatly harmed his health and his fortune but what i regret most is the corruption of his mind by a set of harmful principles that he wont ever be cured of they have survived the passions of youth so theres no chance of his losing them now these two would be agreeable enough if only they didnt fancy themselves freethinkers because of this frankly speaking they make it a little too obvious that they think themselves wiser than the rest of the world i would like it if my guests met with their match where they least expected it in a country farmer euphranor replied im not offering to do more than merely inform myself about their principles and opinions so tomorrow ill assign my workers their work for a week and accept your invitation if dion is willing i gave my consent meanwhile said crito ill prepare my guests telling them that an honest neighbour would like to talk with them about their freethinking ill be surprised if they dont like the prospect of leaving a convert behind them even in a country village next morning euphranor rose early and spent the morning putting his affairs in order after lunch we took our walk to critos which lay through half a dozen pleasant fields after walking for about an hour we came to critos house which stands in the middle of a beautiful little park at the door we met a servant carrying a small basket of fruit to a grove where he said his master was with his two guests we found the three of them sitting in the shade and after the usual preliminaries for people meeting for the first time euphranor and i sat down by them we chatted about the beauty of this rural scene the fine season of the year and some improvementsnew methods of agriculturethat had been introduced recently in the adjacent county this gave alciphron an opening to remark that the most valuable improvements came latest i wouldnt be much tempted he said to live in a place where men dont have polished manners or cultivated minds however greatly its land has been improved i realised long ago that there is a gradual progress in human affairs the first care of mankind is to satisfy the cravings of nature next they attend to the conveniences and comforts of life but subduing prejudices and acquiring true knowledgethat herculean labourcomes last because it requires the most perfect abilities and all other advantages prepare the way for it right said euphranor alciphron has mentioned our true defect it has always been thought that as soon as we had provided subsistence for the body our next concern should be to improve the mind but the desire for wealth steps between and occupies mens thoughts were told that thought is what distinguishes man from beast to which i add that freedom of thought makes just as much difference between man and man its the noble upholders of this privilege and perfection of human kindthe freethinkers i mean who have sprung up and multiplied in recent yearsto whom we are indebted for all those important discoveries that ocean of light that has broken in and poured through in spite of slavery and superstition euphranor who is a sincere enemy to both slavery and superstition expressed his admiration for the good people who had saved their country from being ruined by them having spread so much light and knowledge over the land he added that he liked the name freethinker and approved of peoples being free thinkers but in his sense of the term every honest inquirer after truth in any age or country was entitled to it so what about this sect that according to alciphron had recently sprung up what were their tenets euphranor wanted to know what were their discoveriesthe ones through which they brought benefits to mankind he would be grateful if alciphron would inform him about all this that will be no trouble replied alciphron because i myself am one of them and some of the most considerable freethinkers are close friends of mine and seeing that euphranor was listening respectfully he went on very fluently the mind of man is like a piece of land what uprooting ploughing digging and harrowing is to the land is what thinking reflecting and examining is to the human mind theres a right way to cultivate each land that is allowed to stay waste and wild for a long time will be choked with brushwood brambles thorns and other plants that are neither useful nor beautiful similarly in a neglected uncultivated mind many prejudices and absurd opinions will sprout up owing their origin partly to the soil itself the passions and imperfections of the mind of man and partly to seeds that happen to have been scattered there by every wind of doctrine that is raised up by the cunning of politicians the eccentricities of pedants the superstition of fools or the dishonesty of priests what can we expect the human mind to be like today after so many ages of being vulnerable to the frauds of dishonest men and the follies of weak ones its prejudices and errorswhat strong deep roots they must have what a hard job it will be to tear them out but this difficult glorious work is what the modern freethinkers are undertaking alciphron paused and looked around his listeners indeed i said a very praiseworthy undertaking people generally think said euphranor that it is praiseworthy to clear and subdue the earth to tame brute animals to provide nourishment for mens bodies and cure their illnesses but what is all this in comparison to the most excellent and useful undertaking of freeing mankind from their errors and improving and adorning their minds these days replied alciphron people are fools enough not to be able to tell their best benefactors from their worst enemies they have a blind respect for those who enslave them and regard their deliverers as dangerous men who want to undermine accepted principles and opinions it would be a pity if such worthy and able men were to meet with any discouragement it seems to me that a man who spends his time in such a laborious impartial search for truth is a better friend to mankind than the greatest statesman or hero the good that they do is confined to a small part of the world and a short period of time whereas a ray of truth can enlighten the whole world and carry on into future ages im afraid the common herd wont soon come to think like you about this but the better sort educated men with good abilities are properly respectful of those who support light and truth no doubt the clergy are always ready to help and applaud your worthy endeavours upon hearing this lysicles could hardly stifle his laughter and alciphron with an air of pity told i see that you dont know what these men are really like surely you must realise that of all men living the clergy are our greatest enemies they would if they could extinguish the light of nature itself turn the world into a dungeon and keep mankind for ever in chains and darkness i never imagined anything like this of our protestant clergy particularly the anglican ones whom i would have expectedgoing by what i have seen of them and their writingsto be lovers of learning and useful knowledge believe me priests of all religions are the same where there are priests there will be priestcraft and where there is priestcraft there will be a persecuting spirit you can depend on them to exercise their full persecutory power against anyone who has the courage to think for himself and who refuses to be hoodwinked and shackled by his reverend leaders those great masters of hairsplitting and jargon have fabricated various systemswhich this is added sarcastically are all equally true and equally important for the world everyone is wedded to his own sect and furiously attacks all those who disagree with it the next sentence speaks of the magistrate a term that will occur several more times in these dialogues it is a kind of shorthand for judges and anyone else who is involved in the enforcement of the law of the land sometimes as on page it seems to cover also lawmakers the chief vices of priests and churchmen all over the world are cruelty and ambition so they do their best to get the upper hand over the rest of mankind and the magistratehaving a joint interest with the priest in subduing confusing and scaring the peopletoo often lends a hand to the church authorities who always think that their authority and possessions arent safe until those whose opinions are different from their own are deprived of their rights including the rights belonging to their social status and even their rights as human beings picture to yourselves a monster or ghost made up of superstition and fanaticism the offspring of statecraft and priestcraft rattling chains in one hand and with the other brandishing a flaming sword over the land and threatening destruction to all who dare to follow the dictates of reason and common sense just think about this and then say if our undertaking isnt dangerous as well as difficult and yet because of the noble ardour that truth inspires our freethinkers are neither overcome by the difficulty nor daunted by the danger in spite of both we have already made so many converts among people of the better sort that we hope to be able eventually to carry all before us beat down the walls of secular and ecclesiastical tyranny break the fetters and chains of our countrymen and restore the original inherent rights liberties and privileges of mankind having said all this in a highly emotional way alciphron paused to get his breath back but nobody answered him euphranor was staring at him mouth open so alciphron went on turning to euphranor he spoke less excitedly the more innocent and honest a man is the more vulnerable he is to being taken in by the plausible claims of other men you have probably encountered writings by our theologians that discuss grace virtue goodness and such matterswritings that are fit to confuse and deceive a simple honest mind but however much they may whitewash their designs they are all basically engaged in the same selfish project i dont deny that among the theologians there may be here and there a poor halfwitted man who means no harm but i dont hesitate to say that all the men of sense among them are fundamentally driven by ambition avarice and vengefulness while alciphron was speaking a servant came to tell him and lysicles that some men who were about to set off for london were waiting to receive their orders so they both got up and went towards the house as soon as they were gone euphranor remarked to crito that he thought the poor gentleman must have been made to suffer greatly because of his freethinking because he seemed to speak with the passion and resentment natural to men who have been treated very badly i dont believe it answered crito in members of his sectie freethinkersi have often noticed two conversational faults namely highflown rhetoric and teasing depending on whether their mood of the moment is tragic or comic sometimes they work themselves into high passions and are then frightened by the ghosts they have created when they are having one of those fits every assistant parson of a little country church is seen as an inquisitor at other times they adopt a sly joking manner using hints and allusions saying little but insinuating much and overall seeming to amuse themselves at the expense of the subject and of their adversaries if you want to know what they really believe youll have to get them to speak up and not to ramble off the topic they tend to go on about being persecuted for freethinking but they have no good reason for this because everyone is perfectly free to think what he pleases i dont know of any persecution in england for opinion intellectual attitude or thought but i suppose that in every country some care is taken to restrain obscene speech and to discourage an outward contempt for what the public holds sacred whatever the persons inward thoughts may be whether this care in england has recently become so excessive as to distress the subjects of this formerly free and easy government whether the freethinkers can fairly complain of any hardship suffered because of conscience or opinion youll be better placed to judge when you hear their account of the numbers progress and notions of their sect im sure they will tell you all this fully and freely provided nobody present seems shocked or offended for in that case they may tone things down out of sheer good manners i am never angry with any man for his opinion said euphranor whether hes a jew turk or idolworshipper he can speak his mind freely to me without fear of offending i would even be glad to hear what he has to say provided he says it in an honest open manner whoever digs in the mine of truth is my fellowlabourer i think but if while i am trying hard he amuses himself by teasing me and flinging dust in my eyes ill soon be tired of him in the meantime alciphron and lysicles having settled their bit of business returned to us lysicles sat down in the same place as before but alciphron stood in front of us with his arms folded and his head leaning on his left shoulder in the posture of a man meditating we sat silent so as not to disturb his thoughts and after two or three minutes he said oh truth oh liberty after which he went on musing at this point euphranor ventured to interrupt him alciphron he said it isnt fair to spend your time in silent soliloquies in this corner of the world we dont often get a chance to have a conversation with learned and wellinformed men and the opportunity you have put into my hands is too valuable for me not to make the best use of it are you then a sincere devotee of truth and can you stand the freedom of a fair inquiry thats what i want more than anything what on every subject on the notions that you first took in with your mothers milk and that have ever since been fed to you by other nursesparents pastors tutors religious assemblies books of devotion and other such devices for taking hold of mens minds i love information on all subjects that come my way and especially on those that are most important well then if you are in earnest stay fair and stand firm while i probe your prejudices and wipe out your principleswhile i pull from your heart your hoary old wives tales he says this in latin quoting the poet persius whereupon alciphron frowned paused and then launched forth if we take the trouble to dig down to the bottom of things and analyse the basic principles on which opinions rest well find that the opinions that are thought to be the most important have the flimsiest bases being derived either from the casual customs of the country where we live or from indoctrination that we were subjected to before we could tell right from wrong true from false alciphron is about the speak of the vulgar and to say what he means by that word broadly speaking its sense at that time was common ordinary runofthemill not very educated not possessed of serious intellectual interestssomething along those lines it didnt have the sense of rude crude badmannered or the like in the present work vulgar is sometimes used as a term of disdain or condescension to refer to people who wouldnt have counted as vulgar is the sober strictly literal sense of the word the vulgarmeaning all the people who dont make a free use of their reasontend to regard these prejudices as sacred and unquestionable believing them to be imprinted on the hearts of men by god himself or conveyed by revelation from heaven or so intrinsically clear and evident that one cant help accepting them without any inquiry or examination in this way the shallow vulgar have their heads full of fancies principles and doctrinesreligious moral and politicalall of which they maintain with a level of energy that is proportional to their lack of reason on the other hand those who properly used their faculties in the search for truth are especially careful to weed out of their minds any notions or prejudices that were planted in them before they were old enough to use reason freely and completely our modern freethinkers have actually done this as well as shrewdly dissecting the generally accepted systems of belief they have traced every established prejudice to its sourcethe real reasons why people believe what they believe and in the course of doing thisand getting a comprehensive overview of the various parts and ages of the worldthey have been able to observe an amazing variety of customs and rites of religious and civil institutions of ideas and beliefs that are very unlike and even contrary to one another which conclusively shows that they cant all be true yet each of them is maintained by its supporters with the same air of confidence the same energetic earnestness and when they are examined they all turn out to have the very same foundationnamely the strength of prejudice with the help of these observations and discoveries they have broken the chains of popular custom and having freed themselves from fraud they now generously lend a hand to their fellowsubjects to lead them into the same paths of light and liberty that is a quick summary of the views and projects of the socalled freethinkers if anything that i have said or anything ill say later is contrary to your preconceived opinions and therefore shocking and disagreeable to you youll pardon the openness and plainness of a philosopher and remember that whenever i displease you in that way i am doing it out of respect for the truth and obedience to your own commands im well aware that eyes long kept in the dark cant bear a sudden view of noonday light and must be brought to it by degrees for that reason the able freethinkers proceed gradually starting with the prejudices to which men are least attached and then moving on to undermine the rest by slow and imperceptible degrees till they have demolished the whole fabric of human folly and superstition but i dont have time here to come at things in that roundabout way ill have to proceed directly and plainlymore so perhaps than will be thought prudent and wellmannered we assured him he was entirely free to speak his mind concerning things persons and opinions without holding anything back that is a freedom alciphron replied that we freethinkers are as willing to give as we are to take it we like to call things by their right names and we cant bear having truth suffer because people politely let falsehoods pass without challenge so let us settle this in advance noone will take offence at anything whatsoever that is said on either side we agreed to this well then said alciphron let us start our pursuit of the truth by supposing that i have been brought up inlets saythe church of england the anglican church when i reach maturity of judgment and think about the particular forms of worship and opinions of this church i dont remember when or how they first took possession of my mind as i look back i find them to have been in my mind for as far back as my memory of anything stretches then looking at the upbringing of children as a basis for a judgment about how my own upbringing went i see them being instructed in religious matters before they can reason about them so that all such instruction is nothing but filling the tender mind of a child with prejudices this leads me to reject all those religious ideas regarding them as on a par with the other follies of my childhood i am confirmed in this attitude when i widen my view and see roman catholics and various sects of protestants which all agree in a general profession of belief in christ but differ vastly one from another regarding details of faith and worship then i widen my view still further so as to take in jews and moslems i see that they agree a little with christiansin that they all believe in one godbut each of these religions has its own special laws and revelations for which it expresses the same respect as the others have for their laws and revelations looking further afield still to examine heathen and idolatrous nations i discover an endless variety not only in details of doctrine and forms of worship but even in the very notion of a god in which they differ widely from one another and from all the other sects i have mentioned the bottom line is that instead of simple and uniform truth i see nothing but discord opposition and wild claims all springing up from the prejudices of upbringing from reflecting on and thinking about these facts thoughtful men have concluded that all religions are falseare fables the reason why one man is a christian another a jew a third a moslem a fourth a heathen idolater is that each happened to be brought up in that particular sect so just as each of these contending parties condemns the rest so an unprejudiced bystander will condemn and reject them en bloc seeing that they all originate from the same errorrich source and are kept going by the same techniques to meet the same purposes of the priest and the magistrate see note on page so you think that the magistrate goes along with the priest in misleading the people i do and so must everyone who considers things in a true light for you must know that the magistrates main aim is to keep the people under him in awe now the public eye restrains men from open offences against the laws and government but to prevent secret crimes a magistrate finds it expedient that men should believe that gods eye is watching over their private actions and designs and to intimidate those who might otherwise be drawn into crimes by the prospect of pleasure and profit he tells them that whoever escapes punishment in this life will be sure to find it in the afterlifewhere it will be so heavy and longlasting that it infinitely outweighs any pleasure or profit that he got from his crimes so it has come about that the beliefs that there is a god the soul is immortal and there is a future state of rewards and punishments have been valued as useful engines of government these are rather notional airy doctrines and the rulers need them to impress themselves on peoples senses and to be retained in their minds and so the rulers of the various civilized nations of the earth have skillfully devised temples sacrifices churches rites ceremonies clerical clothing music prayer preaching and other such spiritual foolery all of which helps the priest to prosper in his career and satisfies the magistrate by frightening and subduing the people thats the source of the alliance between church and state religion established by law and the rights immunities and incomes of priests all over the world every government wants you to fear god so that youll honour the king or civil power crito and i heard this speech of alciphrons with the utmost attention but without looking surprisedand indeed for us there was nothing new or unexpected in it but euphranor who had never before been present at such conversation couldnt help showing some astonishment and lysicles who noticed it asked him brightly how he liked alciphrons lecture i think its the first you ever heard of that kind he said and youll have needed a strong stomach to digest it i admit that i dont have the quickest digestion but it has sometimes gradually been able to assimilate things that at first seemed indigestible right now i admire alciphrons free spirit and eloquence but frankly im astonished by his opinions rather than convinced of their truth what he said turning to alciphroncan you really not believe in the existence of a god to be plain with you i do not but this is what i thought would happen a flood of light let in on the mind all at once is more likely to dazzle and disorder the mind than to enlighten it if i werent short of time i would have begun in the regular way first describing the features of religion that arent essential to it then attacking the mysteries of christianity after that proceeding to what christianity teaches about conduct and finally wiping out the belief in a god this last being the first taught of all the religious prejudices and the basis of the rest so that it has taken the deepest root in our minds im not surprised that you still have this belief this prejudice because i have known a number of very able men who had trouble freeing themselves from it not everyone has the same speed and energy of thinking as you do i for one find it hard to keep up with you to help you ill go back a little and pick up the thread of my reasoning first i must tell you that having thought hard about the idea of truth i have found truth to be stable permanent and uniformnot various and changeable like modes or fashions or matters of taste in the next place having observed many sects and splinters from sects adopting very different and contrary opinions while all professing christianity i rejected any doctrine on which they didnt all agree and kept only the one that was agreed to by all and so i became a latitudinarian roughly someone who is a christian in a broad sense with no interest in the details of doctrine church government forms of worship etc that divide branches of christianity from one another after going on to attend to more of the facts i saw that christians jews and moslems have their different systems of faith agreeing only in the belief that there is one god and so i became a deist roughly someone who rejects miracles revelation anything supernatural and has no interest in any organized church or form of worship but believes that natural evidence points to there being a god lastly i extended my view to all the many nations that inhabit this globe and found that they didnt agreewith one another or with any of the sects i have mentionedon any point of faith not even on the notion of a god so i became an atheist because i think that a man of courage and good sense should follow his argument wherever it leads him and that nothing is more ridiculous than to be a freethinker by halves i approve of the man who does the job thoroughlynot merely lopping off the branches but pulling up the root from which they grew regarding this next bit the grand arcanum was the mythical philosophers stone which was reputed to transform lead into gold andor perform other wonders alciphrons ironical use of the term may be meant to indicate that atheism transforms large parts of ones beliefsystem in berkeleys day calling someone a genius was stronger than merely calling him clever but had less force than genius does in our day so you see that atheismwhich frightens women and foolsis the very peak and perfection of freethinking it is the grand arcanum to which a true genius naturally risesperhaps gradually perhaps as a sudden intellectual breakthroughand without it he can never have absolute freedom and peace in his soul to become thoroughly convinced about this central point just examine the notion of a god with the same freedom that you would examine any other prejudice track it back to its source and you wont find that you acquired it through any of your senses though these are in fact the only true means of discovering what is real and substantial in nature youll find it lying among other old lumber in some obscure corner of your imagination the proper dumpingground for visions fancies and prejudices of all kinds and if you are more attached to this bit of lumber than you are to the rest thats only because it is the oldest that is all take my word for it and not just mine but that of many of the ablest men of our times whose views about god are the same as mine they really are though some of these people think they should go more gently in declaring to the world their opinion on this matter than on most others and i have to admit that in england there are still too many people who retain a foolish prejudice against the label atheist but that is lessening every day among people of the better sort and when itie the prejudice against the word atheisthas faded to nothing our freethinkers can then at last be said to have given the deathblow to religion because its obvious that so long as people think that god exists religion must survive in some shape or other but once the root has been plucked up all its offspring will wither and decay as a matter of course the offspring im talking about are all those whimsical notions of conscience duty principle and the like which fill a mans head with worries awe him with fears and make him more thoroughly a slave than is the horse he rides its a thousand times better to be hunted by debtcollectors or bailiffs with subpoenas than to be haunted by these spectres of conscience etc which trouble and embitter all his pleasures creating the most real and severe slavery on earth but the freethinker with a vigorous flight of thought breaks through those airy traps and asserts his basic independence others may talk and write and fight about liberty and outwardly claim to have it but only the freethinker is truly free when alciphron ended this speech with an air of triumph euphranor said to him you make clear work it seems that the gentlemen who believe as you do are admirable weeders you have rooted up a world of notions now show me what fine things you have planted in place of them be patient euphranor ill show you first that we leave untouched whatever was sound and good encouraging it to grow in the mind of man and secondly ill show you what excellent things we have planted there pushing on with our close and severe scrutiny we eventually arrive at something solid and real on which all mankind agree namely the appetites passions and senses these are rooted in nature are real have real objects and bring with them real and substantial pleasuresfood drink sleep and other such animal enjoyments being what all men like and love and if we extend our view to the other kinds of animals well find that they all have certain natural appetites and senses which they are constantly engaged in gratifying and satisfying we are so far from destroying these real natural good things which have nothing notional or fanciful about them that we do our best to cherish and improve them according to us every wise man regards himselfie his own bodily existence in this present worldas the centre and ultimate end of all his actions and concerns he regards his appetites as natural guides that will direct him to his proper good and regards his passions and senses as the natural true means of enjoying this good so he tries to keep his appetites alert and his passions and senses strong and lively and works very hard in every possible way to provide the greatest quantity and variety of real objects suited to them a man who can do this without restraint remorse or fear is as happy as any other animal whatsoeveras happy as his nature is capable of being there i have given you a condensed view of the principles discoveries and beliefs of the select spirits here the best minds of this enlightened age after a polite little toandfro about the need for open frankness on both sides the discussion continues i am half ashamed said euphranor to admit that i have a weakness that lesser minds are prone to im no great genius i have favourite opinions that you represent as errors and prejudices for instance the immortality of the soul is a notion im fond of because it supports the mind with a very pleasing prospect if it is wrong i might side with cicero who said that in that case he would be sorry to know the truth and speaking of certain philosophers of his time who taught that the human soul was mortal said that he had nothing to thank them for those philosophers seem to have been predecessors of those who are now called freethinkers euphranor goes on to remark that freethinker is too general a name and that he has no objection to thinking freely he proposes that the sect be given the name that cicero gave them with all my heart what name is it why he calls them minute philosophers this is minute small not seconds euphranors point is of course not that these philosophers are small but that they represent valuable things as small or of small importance alciphron will soon suggest a different meaning for the label right said crito the modern freethinkers are just like the ones that cicero called minute philosophers its an excellent name for them because they diminish all the most valuable thingsthe thoughts views and hopes of men they reduce all the knowledge ideas and theories that men have to sense they shrink and downgrade human nature to the narrow low standard of animal life and they assign to us only a small pittance of time instead of immortality alciphron very gravely remarked that the gentlemen of his sect had not insulted man and that if man is a little shortlived negligible animal it wasnt their saying it that made him so and they were no more to blame for whatever defects they reveal in themselves than a good mirror is to blame for making the wrinkles that it shows as for your remark that those we now call freethinkers were in ancient times called minute philosophers i suggest that this label may have come from their considering things minutely rather than swallowing them in great lumps as other men usually do anyway we all know that the best eyes are necessary to pick out the minutest objects so it seems that minute philosophers might have been socalled because they were so sharpsighted o alciphron these minute philosophers that is the right name for them are like pirates who plunder everything that comes in their way i feel like a man who has been left stripped and desolate on a bleak beach but who are these profound and learned men that in recent years have demolished the whole fabric that lawgivers philosophers and theologians had been erecting for so many ages lysicles smiling said he believed euphranor was imagining philosophers in square caps and long gowns and that in these happy times the reign of pedantry was over our philosophers he said are very different from the awkward students who try to get knowledge by poring over dead languages and ancient authors or by shutting themselves off from the cares of the world to meditate in solitude they are the best bred men of the age men who know the world men of pleasure men of fashion and fine gentlemen i have some idea of the people youre talking about but i would never have taken them for philosophers nor would anyone else until quite recently it seems that for centuries everyone mistakenly thought that the way to knowledge was through a tedious course of academic education and study but one of the chief discoveries of the present time is that such a method slows down and blocks knowledge rather than promoting it crito is of course speaking sarcastically he doesnt actually side with the minute philosophers he will keep up this tone until page where he will come into the open his open attacks on the minute philosophy in the second dialogue are the most rhetorically vivid and passionate things that berkeley ever wrote there are two strands in academic study reading and thinking what the students mainly read are ancient authors in dead languages so that much of their time is spent in learning words which once theyve been laboriously mastered reward the scholar with old and obsolete ideas that are now quite exploded and abandoned as for their thinking what good can possibly come of it if someone doesnt have the right materials to think about he can think and meditate for ever without getting anywhere those cobwebs that scholars spin out of their own brains are neither useful nor beautiful theres only one way to get proper ideas or materials of thought and that is by keeping good company i know several gentlemen who since their appearance in the world the nonacademic world or perhaps more narrowly the world of high society and fashion have spent as much time rubbing off the rust and pedantry of a college education as they had first spent acquiring it ill bet that a fourteenyearold who is brought up in the modern way will make a better showing and be more admired in any drawingroom or assembly of cultivated people than a twentyfouryearold who has set aside long time for studies at school and college hell say better things in a better manner and be more liked by good judges where does he pick up all this improvement where our solemn ancestors would never have looked for it in a drawingroom a coffeehouse a tavern a gambling den in fashionable places like these its the custom for cultivated persons to speak freely on all subjectsreligious moral or political so that a young gentleman who spends much time in them is in a position to hear many instructive lectures spiced with wit and teasing and uttered with energy three or four welldelivered sentences from a man of quality make more of an impression and convey more knowledge than a dozen dry academic lectures so theres no method no set course of studies in those places none but an easy free conversation which takes up every topic that anyone offers without any rule or design i always thought that to get any useful amount of knowledge one needed some order in ones studies that haste and confusion create selfsatisfied ignorance that our advances cant be secure unless they are gradual and that one should start by learning things that might cast a light on what was to follow so long as learning could be obtained only by that slow formal course of study few of the better people knew much of it but now that learning has grown into a pastime our young gentry and nobility unknowingly absorb it during their other pastimes and make a considerable progress thats presumably why there are so many minute philosophers crito resumes his sarcastic pretended admiration for the minute philosophers then it would seem then that method exactness and hard work are a positive disadvantage here alciphron turning to lysicles said he could make the point very clear if euphranor had any notion of painting i never saw a firstrate picture in my life but i have a pretty good collection of prints and have seen some good drawings so you know the difference between the dutch and the italian manner i have some idea of it well then compare a drawing done by the exact and laborious touches of a dutch pencil with a drawing casually dashed off in the free manner of a great italian master the dutch piece which has taken so much trouble and time will indeed be exact but it wont have the force spirit or grace that appear in the italian drawing and are the effects of an easy free pencil apply this example to our discussion and youll get my point tell me did those great italian masters begin and continue in their art without any choice of method or subject and always draw with the same ease and freedom or did they conform to some method beginning with simple and elementary partsan eye a nose a fingerwhich they drew with great effort and care often drawing the same thing over and over again so as to get it right and so gradually acquiring through patience and hard work through many years the free masterly manner you speak of if the latter is right i leave you to apply the example to our discussion so that you will get my point dispute the matter if you like but a man of many talents is one thing and a pedant is another hard methodical work may do for some kinds of people it takes a long time to ignite wet straw and when you do you get a vile smothering flame whereas spirits blaze out at once the minute philosophers have it seems better talents than other men which qualifies them for a different education tell me euphranor what does one man get to look good in a way that others dont what causes him to be more polished in how he dresses how he speaks and how he moves nothing but keeping good company that is also how men gradually and unconsciously get a delicate taste a refined judgment a certain polish in thinking and expressing themselves its not surprising that you folk who live out in the country arent acquainted with the advantage of elegant conversation which constantly keeps the mind awake and active making use of its abilities and demanding all its strength and spirit on a thousand different occasions and on subjects that never come in the way of a bookworm in a college any more than a ploughman hence the lively faculties quickness of uptake slyness of ridicule and enormous talent of wit and humour that distinguish the gentlemen who believe as you do it should seem then that your sect is made up of what you call fine gentlemen not altogether for we have among us some thoughtful people whose upbringing was coarser but though they cant be called fine gentlemen they have made fine contributions to our cause having observed the behaviour of apprentices watermen porters and the gatherings of rabble in the streets they have arrived at a profound knowledge of human nature and made great discoveries about the sources springs and motives of moral actions the phrase moral actions standardly meant actions that do or could involve consciously held reasons or purposes these discoveries have demolished the accepted systems of morality and done a world of good in the city we have men of all sorts and professionsplodding citizens thriving stockbrokers skillful men of business elegant courtiers gallant men of the armybut our chief strength comes from those promising young men who have the advantage of a modern education these are the growing hopes of our sect through their influence we expect the great things we have in view will be actually accomplished i would never have thought your sect was so considerable many honest folk in england are as much in the dark about these matters as you are it would be wrong to infer what the prevailing opinion among people of fashion is from what is said by a legislator in parliament a judge on the bench or a priest in the pulpit they all speak according to law ie according to the reverend prejudices of our forefathers you should go into good company and take note of what able and wellbred men say those who are most listened to and most admired in public gatherings as well as in private conversations only someone who has these opportunities can know our real strength our numbers and the impression we make on the world by your account there must be many minute philosophers among the men of rank and fortune a good many and they contribute greatly to the spreading of our notions anyone who knows the world has to know that fashions always come from above so the right way to propagate an opinion is to start at the upper end of society also the patronage of men of rank and fortune is an encouragement to our authors so you have authors among you we do indeed a number of them and they are very great men who have favoured the world with many useful and profound discoveries he is now laying on really thick his sarcastically intended rhetoric in favour of the minute philosophers he will soon drop it altogether the proper names in this speech refer to real people the device of giving ones targets ancientsounding names was a common practice in polemical writing at that time moschon for instance has proved that man and beast are really of the same nature and that consequently a man needs only to indulge his senses and appetites to be as happy as a brute gorgias has gone further demonstrating that man is a piece of clockwork a machine and that thought or reason are the same thing as the collision of balls cimon has made distinguished use of these discoveries proving as clearly as any proposition in mathematics that conscience is a whim and morality a prejudice and that a man is no more accountable for his actions than a clock is for striking what tryphon has written about the usefulness of vice cant be refuted thrasenor has destroyed the foolish prejudice men had against atheism showing that a republic of atheists might live very happily together demylus has made a joke of loyalty and convinced the world that theres nothing in it we owe to him and to another philosopher of the same type the discovery that public spirit is a pointless fanaticism that seizes only on weak minds i could go on indefinitely reciting the discoveries made by writers of this sect but the masterpiece and coup de grace for the old system is a learned work by our great diagoras containing a demonstration of the nonexistence of god it hasnt yet been published because the public are thought to be not yet ripe for it but im assured by some judicious friends who have seen it that its as clear as daylight and will do a world of good by demolishing at one blow the whole system of religion these discoveries are published by our philosophers sometimes in bound books but often merely in pamphlets and loose pages making it easier for them to be spread through the kingdom they deserve the credit for the absolute and independent freedom that is growing so fast and frightening the bigots even dull and ignorant people start to open their eyes and to be influenced by the example and authority of so many able men it should seem by this accountor rather by what crito last saidthat your sect extend their discoveries beyond religion and that the minute philosopher regards loyalty to his king and reverence for the laws as lowdown things very lowdown we are too wise to think there is anything sacred about the king or the constitution or indeed about anything else a man of sense may seem to show an occasional deference to his king but thats as hollow as his deference to god when he kneels at the sacrament so as to qualify himself for an office government job fear god and honour the king are two slavish maxims that had for a long time cramped human nature and awed not only weak minds but even men of good understanding until their eyes were opened by our philosophers its easy to see that when the fear of god is quite extinguished the mind must take a relaxed attitude to other duties as soon as those other duties lose their hold on the conscience which always presupposes the existence of a god they become mere outward pretences and formalities but i still thought that englishmen of all schools of thought however much they may differ on many details agreed in the belief in god and accepted at least the propositions of socalled natural religion i have already told you my own opinion on those matters and what i know to be the opinion of many others i think i know what has led you astray euphranor the minute philosophers are sometimes called deists see note on page which has led you to imagine that they believe in and worship a god according to the light of nature but if you live among them youll soon be convinced of the contrary they have neither time nor place nor form of divine worship they dont offer prayers or praises to god in public and in their private lives they show a disregard or dislike even of the duties of natural religion for example saying grace before and after meals this is a plain point of natural worship and there was a time when everyone did it but in proportion as this sect of minute philosophers prevailed it has been laid aside not only by the minute philosophers themselves but also by others who are afraid of being thought fools by the minute philosophers are you really saying that men who genuinely believe in a god decline to perform such an easy and reasonable duty for fear of being sneered at by atheists yes i am many people who believe in their hearts the truth of religion are afraid or ashamed to admit it lest they should lose their standing in the eyes of those who have the good luck to be regarded as great wits and men of genius we must make allowance for critos prejudice euphranor he is a worthy gentleman and means well but doesnt it look like prejudice to ascribe the respect that is paid our ingenious freethinkers to good luck rather than to merit im sure their merit is very wonderful it would take a great man to prove such paradoxeseg that someone as knowledgeable as a minute philosopher should be a mere machine or at best no better than a brute it is a true maxim that a man should think with the learned and speak with the vulgar berkeley had already famously said this in his principles of human knowledge regarding the vulgar see note on page i would be very reluctant to describe a gentleman of merit as a machine to an audience of prejudiced and ignorant men the doctrines of our philosophy have something in common with many other truths in metaphysics geometry astronomy and natural science namely that vulgar ears cant bear them all our discoveries and ideas are in themselves true and certain but they are at present known only to the better people and would sound strange and odd among the vulgar its to be hoped that this will eventually wear off im not surprised that vulgar minds should be startled by the ideas of your philosophy truly a very curious sort of philosophy and much to be wondered at the deep thinkers in the minute philosophy camp have gone in exactly the opposite way to all the great philosophers of earlier ages who tried to raise and refine humanity removing it as far as possible from the brute to moderate and subdue mens appetites to remind men of the dignity of their nature to awaken and improve their higher faculties and direct them onto the noblest objects to fill mens minds with a high sense of god of the supreme good and of the immortality of the soul but our minute philosophers seem to go the opposite way from all other wise and thoughtful men because they aim to erase from the mind of man the sources of all that is great and good to disrupt the order of civil life to undermine the foundations of morality and to bring us down to the maxims and way of thinking of the most uneducated and barbarous nations and even to pull humanity down to the level of brute beasts and through all this they want to be accepted by the world as men of deep knowledge but all this negative knowledgedoes it come down to anything better than downright savage ignorance that there is no god no spirit no afterlife no moral duty truly a fine system for an honest man to accept or for a clever man to be proud of alciphron who heard this discourse with some uneasiness very gravely replied disputes are not to be decided by the weight of authority he said but by the force of reason call our notions brutish and barbarous if you please but its a kind of brutishness and barbarism that few people would be capable of if men of the greatest genius hadnt cleared the logjam because theres nothing harder than to overcome ones upbringing and conquer old prejudices it takes great courage and great strength of faculties to pick out and cast off a heap of rubbish that has been gathering in the soul from our very infancy so our philosophers thoroughly deserve to be called esprits forts men of strong heads freethinkers and so on labels that indicate great strength and freedom of mind the heroic labours of these men may be represented for anything can be misrepresented as piratically plundering and stripping the mind of its wealth and ornaments when really they are only divesting it of its prejudices and reducing it to its untainted original state of naturebeautiful pure nature you seem to be impressed by the beauty of nature please alciphron tell me what the things are that you regard as natural how are we to recognize something as natural for a thing to be natural to the mind of man to start with that special case it must appear in the human mind originally from the outset from birth be present universally in the minds of all men and be invariably the same in all nations and ages these threeoriginalness universality invariability exclude all the notions that humans have as results of custom and upbringing this also holds for all other species of beings a cats inclination to pursue a mouse is natural because it satisfies the above three criteria but if a cat is taught to play tricks you wont say that the tricks are natural for the same reason if peaches and apricots are grafted onto a plumtree nobody will say they are the natural growth of that tree lets get back to the human case it seems that the only things youll count as natural in mankind are ones that show themselves at the time of a persons first entrance into the worldnamely the senses and such passions and appetites as reveal themselves as soon as their respective objects appeareg hunger when there is milk fear when there is a loud noise and so on that is my opinion qa note euphranor now asks alciphron seven rhetorical questions to the first six of which alciphron gives the expected answers including it seems so i do and it is true to spare us the tedious questionandanswer routine the questions will appear here as simple statements with the first six answers omitted this condensing device will be used on fourteen other occasions each marked by four or more statements by euphranor labelled with roman numerals and a mention of this note i the leaves blossom and apples of an apple tree are natural to it although it doesnt have them from the outset ii the appetite of lust and the faculty of reason are natural to a man even though they dont shoot forth open and display themselvesas leaves and blossoms do in a treeuntil long after his original infancy iii so it seems that you were being rash when you said that the first criterion for somethings being natural to the mind was that it should appear in it originally iv also it is natural for an orange tree to produce oranges v but if you plant such a tree at the north end of great britain you may if you work hard at it get a good salad ie leaves but no fruit in the southern parts of the island hard careful work may get it to produce mediocre fruit but in portugal or naples it will produce much better fruit with little or no trouble on the part of the farmer vi the plant is the same in all these places but it doesnt produce the same fruit sun soil and cultivation make a difference vii and since according to you its the same story for every species cant we conclude that some things may be natural to mankind although they are not found in all men and arent invariably the same where they are found hold on euphranor you must explain yourself further i shant be rushed into conceding your points youre right to be wary alciphron i dont like these ensnaring questions i dont want you to go along with me out of politeness just tell me what you think about each particular matter so that we understand one another know what we agree on and proceed together in finding out the truth our opinions will stand the test we fear no trial proceed as you please see qa note on page i we seem to have found that things may be natural to men without actually being on display in all men or not as completely on display because differences of culture and other advantages affect what comes of human nature as much as they do with the nature of plants i am using your own comparison ii men at all times and places when they arrive at a certain age express their thoughts by speech iii so it seems that language is natural iv yet there is a great variety of languages v from all this it follows that a thing may be natural and yet admit of variety vi it seems to follow that a thing may be natural to mankind without having the marks of naturalness that you presentie without being original universal and invariable vii consequently religious worship and civil government may be natural to man despite the fact that they occur in a variety of forms and in different degrees of perfection viii you have granted already that reason is natural to mankind ix so whatever is agreeable to reason is agreeable to the nature of man x doesnt it follow from this that truth and virtue are natural to man whatever is reasonable i admit to be natural the fruits that we value most are the ones that come from the most strongly growing and mature stock in the choicest soil similarly then oughtnt we to value most the sublime truths that are the fruits of mature thought and have been rationally deduced by men with the best and most developed minds and if this is right and these things are in fact reasonable natural and true they oughtnt to be written off as unnatural whims errors of upbringing and groundless prejudices just because they are raised and developed by manuring and cultivating young human minds ie because they take root early and bring forth early fruit through the care and diligence of our instructors agreed provided that they can still be rationally deduced but to take for granted that what men vulgarly call the truths of morality and religion have a rational basis would be begging the question he means that it would be in effect including the conclusion of ones argument amongst its premises that was the only meaning of beg the question until late in the th century when the vulgarspecifically the ones working as journalistslearned the phrase and assumed that it meant raise the question youre right about that so i dont take for granted that the truths of morality and religion are rationally deduced i only suppose that if they are then they must be regarded as natural to manie that they fit with and grow from the most excellent part of human nature the part that other natural species dont have i have no objection to bring against this then what are we to think of your former assertions i mean your claims that anything that is natural to man can be found in all men in all nations and ages of the world and that to obtain a genuine view of human nature we must set aside all the effects of upbringing and instruction and look only at the senses appetites and passions that are to be found originally in all mankind and that therefore the notion of a god cant be based in nature because it isnt originally in the mind and isnt the same in all men how do you reconcile these opening statements of yours with your recent concessionsones that the force of truth seems to have extorted from you tell me euphranor isnt truth a single uniform invariable thing and if it is isnt the existence of the many different and mutually inconsistent notions that men have of god and duty a plain proof there is no truth in them i freely grant that truth is constant and uniform so that two opinions that contradict one another cant both be true but it doesnt follow that they are both false when there are conflicting opinions about the same thing the one if there is one that is grounded on clear and evident reasons should be regarded as true and others accepted only to the extent that they are consistent with that privileged one reason is the same at all times and places and when it is used properly it will lead to the same conclusions two thousand years ago socrates seems to have reasoned himself into the same notion of a god that is entertained by the philosophers of our days if youll allow someone who isnt a freethinker to be called philosopher and consider confuciuss remark that a man should be on guard in his youth against lust in manhood against quarrelsomeness and in old age against greedthis morality is as current in europe as in china but when opinions differ that shows that there is uncertainty so it would be good if all men thought the same way what do you think to be the cause of a lunar eclipse the earths coming between the sun and moon making a shadow on the moon are you sure of this certainly are all mankind agreed in this truth by no means ignorant and barbarous people give different ridiculous explanations for this phenomenon so it seems that there are different opinions about the nature of an eclipse there are yet one of these opinions is true it is thus when there are conflicting opinions about something it may still be the case that the thing exists and one of the opinions about it is true i accept that well you argued from the variety of opinions about gods nature to the falsity of the opinion that he exists and now it seems that this argument is not conclusive and i dont see either how you can infer the falsity of any moral or religious tenet from mens conflicting opinions on the same subject isnt arguing like that on a par with arguing that no historical account of a matter of fact can be true if reports of it conflict with one another or arguing that because the various schools of philosophy maintain different opinions none of them can be in the rightnot even the minute philosophers during this conversation lysicles seemed uneasy like someone who profoundly wanted there to be no god alciphron he said i think you are sitting tamely on the sidelines while euphranor undermines the foundation of our tenets dont be afraid replied a skillful player of a game sometimes ruins his adversary by giving him some advantage at first i am glad he said turning to euphranor that youre willing to argue and make your appeals to reason for my part i shant be afraid to follow wherever reason leads so let me say this openly i freely concede the points you have been contending for i dont value the success of a few crude notions thrown out in a casual conversation any more than the turks care about the loss of the rubbishinfantry that they position at the front of their armies so as to waste the gunpowder and blunt the swords of their enemies i have kept a good half of my arguments in reserve and i am ready to bring them forward i will undertake to prove i dont doubt your ability to prove alciphron but before i put you to the trouble of any more proofs id like to know whether the notions of your minute philosophy are worth proving i mean whether they are useful and helpful to mankind as to that let me tell you a thing can be useful to one mans views and not to anothers but truth is truth whether or not its useful and it mustnt be evaluated by whether it is convenient for this or that man or sect but isnt the general good of mankind to be regarded as a rule or guide to evaluation of moral truths indeed of all truths that direct or influence the moral actions see note on page of men its not clear to me that that is right i know of course that legislators theologians and politicians have always maintained that it is necessary for the wellbeing of mankind that men should be kept in awe by the slavish notions of religion and morality but even if you are right about what is convenient or helpful how does that prove these moral notions to be true convenience is one thing and truth is another so a real philosopher will set aside all advantages and consider only truth itself tell me alciphron is your real philosopher a wise man or a fool without question hes the wisest of men as between someone who acts with design and someone who acts at random which should we regard as the wiser the one who acts with design see qa note on page well then i whoever acts with design acts for some end ii and a wise man acts for a good end iii and he shows his wisdom in his choice of means to the end he aims at iv and so the more excellent the pursued end is and the more appropriate the chosen means to it are the wiser the person should be thought to be now v a rational agent cant aim at a more excellent end than happiness vi of good things the greater good is most excellent vii the general happiness of mankind is a greater good than the private happiness of one man or of some particular class of men viii so the general happiness of mankind is the most excellent end ix so those who pursue this end by the most appropriate methods should be regarded as the wisest men x a wise man is governed by wise notions rather than foolish ones xi it seems to follow that someone who promotes the general wellbeing of mankind by the proper necessary means is truly wise and acts on wise grounds xii furthermore folly is the opposite of wisdom xii so mightnt we infer that men who try to dislodge principles that have a necessary connection with the general good of mankind are foolish perhaps this might be granted but at the same time i have to say that it is in my power to deny it what you admit the premises so surely you wont deny the conclusion i want to know what the rules are for our debate in this process of question and answer if a man makes a slip is he allowed to recover for if you are on the lookout for every advantage that you can snatch without allowing for surprise or inattention on my part i have to tell you that this is not the way to convince me of your views im not aiming at triumph alciphron all i want is truth so its completely open to you to unravel all that has been said and to correct any slip you have made but then you must point it out clearly otherwise we cant ever arrive at any conclusion i am also sincerely devoted to truth and agree with you on these terms to proceed together in search of it in the course of our present inquiry i think i slipped when i acknowledged that the general happiness of mankind is a greater good than the particular happiness of one man in fact the individual happiness of each man alone constitutes his own entire good the happiness of other men is not a part of my happiness so from my standpoint it isnt a goodi mean a true natural good so it cant be a reasonable end for me to aim at because no wise man will pursue an end that doesnt concern him i am talking about true natural ends not the ends one might announce as political pretences this is the voice of naturethe fountain source and pattern of all that is good and wise so would you like to follow nature and accept her as a guide and as a pattern for you to imitate i want that more than anything where do you get this respect for nature from from the excellence of its productions for example you say that there is usefulness and excellence in a plant because its many parts are connected and fitted to each other in such a way as to protect and nourish the whole plant make the individual grow and propagate the species and also because we get pleasure and benefit from itgrapes from a vine shade or timber from an oak just so similarly dont you infer the excellence of animal bodies from observing the structure and fitness of their many parts which enables the parts to work together for the wellbeing of each other as well as of the whole animal dont you also notice a natural union and cooperation between animals of the same species and that even animals of different species have certain qualities and instincts through which they contribute to the exercise nourishment and delight of each other even inanimate inorganic materials seem to have an excellence relative to each other why would water be excellent if it didnt cause herbs and vegetables to spring from the earth and put forth flowers and fruit and what would become of the beauty of the earth if it werent warmed by the sun moistened by water and fanned by air note the four elements of ancient greek philosophy throughout the whole system of the visible and natural world dont you see a mutual connection and correspondence of parts and isnt that the basis for your idea of the perfection and order and beauty of nature i accept all this now didnt the stoics who were no more bigots than you are sayand didnt you say a few minutes ago that this pattern of natural order is one that rational agents ought to imitate i dont deny that this is true so oughtnt we infer the same union order and regularity in the moral world that we see in the natural world we ought shouldnt it seem to follow from this that reasonable creatures were made for one another and consequently that a man who wants live according to nature ought to consider himself not as an independent individual whose happiness is unconnected with the happiness of others but rather as the part of a whole for whose common good he ought work together with the other parts ie other men supposing this to be true what then wont it follow that a wise man should consider and pursue his own private good in the light of and in combination the good of other menyou granted this point but later said that that was a slip indeed the point doesnt need a fancy argument by me because it has always been seen to be clearly proved by how we feel for one anothers pain and pleasure and by the mutual affections by which mankind are knit together and because it was the constant doctrine of those who were thought the wisest and most thoughtful men among the ancientsplatonists aristotelians and stoicsnot to mention christians whom you pronounce to be an unthinking prejudiced sort of people i shant dispute this point with you well then since we are in agreement up to here shouldnt it seem to follow from the premises that if the beliefs in a god a future state and moral duties are necessarily connected with the wellbeing of mankind then those beliefs are the only wise right and genuine sources of human conduct you have been led to this conclusion by your own concessions and by the analogy of nature ie by the thesis that human conduct ought to fall into patterns that natural events do fall into i have been drawn into it step by step through many preliminaries and i cant now remember them all clearly but i would point out that you rely on the thesis that those religious and moral principles are necessarily connected with the wellbeing of mankindand thats something that you havent proved and i havent granted berkeleys text like this version of it leaves unclear what direction of necessary connection in question either a the beliefs in god etc inevitably contribute to human wellbeing or b without them human wellbeing is impossible i think its a great big fundamental prejudice and if i had time i could show you that thats what it is but its late now shall we put off this subject till tomorrow with that we put an end to our conversation for that evening second dialogue tuesday in the original work though not in this version this dialogue is the secondtolongest of the set its not very interesting philosophically and a connected fact in it the freethinking side is upheld only by lysicles with alciphron silent throughout next morning alciphron and lysicles said that the weather was so fine that they would like to spend the day outside having a picnic meal under a shade in some pleasant part of the countryside so we went to a nearby beach and walked on the sands until the sun became too hot to be comfortable we then went in among the trees and sat down and immediately lysicles addressed himself to im now ready to make good on my undertaking to show there is nothing in the necessary connection that some men imagine there to be between the principles you are defending and the public good if the question were to be decided by the authority of legislators or philosophers of course it would go against us thats because those men generally take it for granted that vice is harmful to the public and that the only way to keep men from vice is through their fear of god and their sense of an afterlife from which they infer that the belief in such things is necessary to the wellbeing of mankind this false notion has held sway for centuries and has done an infinite amount of mischief it has been the real cause of religions being established within states and of the way laws and magistrates have protected and encouraged the clergy and their superstitions even some of the wisest ancient philosophersones who agreed with our sect in denying the existence of a god and the immortality of the soulwere weak enough to accept the common prejudice that vice is hurtful to human societies but england has recently produced great philosophers who have undeceived the world and conclusively shown that private vices are public benefits this was the subtitle of mandevilles notorious fable of the bees lysicles will now devote about a page to presenting arguments taken from mandeville it wasnt until now that this discovery was made and our sect of freethinkers has the glory of it back to sarcasm it may be that some men with fine intellects did in former ages have a glimpse of this important truth but probably they lived at ignorant times and in bigoted countries that werent ripe for such a discovery men of few talents and short sight being able to see no further than one link along a chain of consequences are shocked at small evils that come with vice but those who can take in more and look along a lengthy series of events can see thousands of examples of happiness resulting from vice and of good growing out of evil i shant trouble you with authoritative writers or elaborate arguments lets just look at some plain matters of fact take each particular vice and track it through all its effects and consequences and you clearly see the advantage it brings to the public drunkenness for instance is a harmful vice according to your sober moralists but thats because they didnt take into account the good effects that flow from it lysicles goes on to describe some of these for vulgar drunkenness income from a tax on malt and employment for many different kinds of workers in the beer industry for drunkenness caused by wine and spirits admittedly that sends money into foreign countries but it creates employment in the home countryvastly increased and proliferated by the need for ships then there are all the trades involved in making things that ships export to pay for the wine and spirits and every trade is supported by and supports yet further trades so that theres no end to the good that comes from drunkenness then equally stupidly your halfwitted folk are given to condemning gaming here playing cards for money on the face of it cardplaying seems to be a very idle and useless occupation but if you dig down below the face of it youll see that this idle pastime employs the cardmaker who provides work for the papermills which support the poor man who collects discarded rags not to mention the workers who are employed in building and equipping those mills look still deeper and youll find that candles to light the games and the hiring of sedanchairs to take the players to the game employ the industrious and the poor in this way they are helped by cardsharpers and gentlemen who wouldnt give a penny in charity you may object that many gentlemen and ladies are ruined by gaming but if you do you arent taking into account that what one man loses another gets so that as many are enriched as are ruined money changes hands thats what the life of business and commerce consists inthe circulation of money when money is spent the public doesnt care who spends it suppose an upperclass fool is cheated by a very lowbred fellow who has more brainswhat harm does this do to the public poverty is relieved ingenuity is rewarded the money stays at home you may object that a man made poor by gaming may resort to some desperate conduct that will be hurtful to the public lysicles goes on to speak of the good a highwayman can do mainly by spending extravagantly during his short and merry life but also through the reward that may go to a poor family that turns him in to the police my topic was gaming which smoothly led me to the advantages of highway robbery oh the beautiful and neverenoughadmired connection of vices it would take too long to show how they all hang together and what an infinite amount of good arises from each of them ill add just a few words now on a favourite vice then ill leave you to work out the rest of the story for yourselfive shown you how consider a poor girl who doesnt have what you would call an honest halfcrown a week to spend she has the good luck to become someones kept mistress and immediately she employs milliners laundresses dressers fabricsellers and a number of other trades all to the benefit of her country we could go on for ever tracking every particular vice through its consequences and effects showing the vast advantage they all bring to the public the true springs that drive the great machine of commerce and make the state flourish have been little understood until now your moralists and theologians have long been corrupting the genuine sense of mankind filling mens heads with absurd principlesso long and so absurd that few men now can look at life with an unprejudiced eye and fewer still have the talents and intelligence to pursue a long chain of consequences relations and dependences which is what you must do if you want to form a sound and complete notion of the public welfare oh said euphranor who had listened to this speech very attentively you are the very man i wanted lysicles eloquent and able wellinformed about the principles of your sect and willing to impart them to others tell me is it easy to get these principles accepted in the world it is easy among very able men and people of fashion though youll sometimes meet with strong prejudices against them in people of the middle sort an effect of ordinary talents and low breeding id be surprised if men were not shocked at such surprising notions so contrary to all laws education and religion theyd have been even more shocked if it hadnt been for the skillful writing style of our philosophers knowing that most men are influenced by names rather than by things they have introduced a certain cleanedup way of speaking which lessens much of the revulsion and prejudice against vice explain this for me well in our dialect an immoral man is a man of pleasure a cardsharper is one who plays the whole game an adulterous lady is said to have an affair an adulterous gentleman is said to be gallant a rogue in business is said to be one who knows the world by this means we have no such things as drunkards womanisers whores or rogues in the fashionable world whose inhabitants can enjoy their vices without having nasty labels attached to them so it seems that vice is a fine thing with an ugly name be assured it is plato was afraid that young people might be corrupted by the myths that represent the gods as vicious according to you it seems that attitude was an effect of his weakness and ignorance it was take my word for it yet plato had kept good company and lived in a court and cicero who knew the world well had a deep respect for him plato and cicero may have looked good in ancient athens or rome but if they returned to life today they would be regarded as underbred pedants at most coffeehouses in london there are several able men who could convince plato and cicero that they knew nothing about morals and politicsthe very topics that they are valued so much for not the most sharpwitted of men lysicles hasnt picked up the note of sarcastic scorn in what crito has just said i know ever so many shrewd men both in royal court circles and in the business parts of the city who have five times platos sense and dont care in the slightest what notion their sons have of god or virtue i can illustrate this doctrine of lysicles by two examples that will make you perceive its force the examples are fictional in the first a minute philosopher turns his son into a member of that sect which leads to the sons murdering him and then squandering his estate until he goes bankrupt in the second a minute philosopher converts his wife to his way of thinking he rightly thinks this will stop her from giving to charity and this leads her to adopt an extravagant way of life including playing cards for high stakes thus using up most of her husbands wealth in each case crito recites the mandevillean public benefits of the behaviour in question the murderous sons recklessness spreads his inherited wealth more widely than his miserly father ever would have done the extravagant wife through her gaming transferred a considerable share of her husbands fortune to a number of sharpwitted men who needed it more and circulated it faster than her husband would have done crito maintained a straight face while he told these stories but i couldnt help smiling which lysicles noticed superficial minds he said may find something to ridicule in these accounts but anyone who is really competent in rational thinking must see that a wise commonwealth ought to encourage maxims that bring benefit to everyone and do harm only to particular private persons or families speaking for myself said euphranor i declare that im dazzled and bewildered rather than convinced by your reasoning as you yourself pointed out it takes a great deal of thought to grasp the connections of many distant points soplease put up with my slowness and allow me to take to pieces something that is too big to be taken in all at once and when i cant match your speed allow me to follow you step by step as fast as i can that is reasonable its not everyone who can all in one swoop take in a long chain of argument see qa note on page i your various arguments seem to centre on this vice circulates money and promotes industry which causes a people to flourish ii and vice produces this effect by causing extravagant consumption which is the most beneficial to the manufacturers giving them a quick demand and high price iii so you think that a drunkard because he drinks more than other men brings more benefit to the brewer and the vintner than other men do iv a healthy man drinks more than a sick man v a sober man is healthier than a drunkard so vi a sober man in good health may drink more than a drunkard when he is sick vii a man will consume more meat and drink in a long life than in a short one viii so a sober healthy man may in a long life circulate more money by eating and drinking than a glutton or drunkard circulates in a short life what of it well it seems that the sober healthy man may be more beneficial to the publici mean beneficial through how he eats and drinksthan the glutton or the drunkard is youll never get me to agree that temperance is the way to promote drinking but you will agree that sickness lessens drinking and that death puts an end to it the same argument will hold so far as i can see for every vice that harms mens health and shortens their lives and if that is so the public benefits of vice wont be so sure granted some makers or traders might be as well encouraged by the sober men as the vicious what about the ones whose livelihood depends entirely on vice and vanity if there are people like that couldnt they be employed in some other way without loss to the public tell me lysicles is there anything in the nature of vice in itself that makes it a public blessing or is it only the consumption it causes i have already shown how it benefits the nation by the consumption of things the nation manufactures and you have agreed that a long and healthy life consumes more than a short and sickly one and you wont deny that many consume more than one you do the math which is more likely to promote the industry of his countrymen a virtuous married man with healthy children of his own who also feeds and clothes the orphans in his neighbourhood or a fashionable looseliving man about town doesnt innocently spent money circulate as well as money spent on vice and if it does so doesnt your line of thought imply that innocent activities benefit the public as much as vicious ones what i have proved i proved clearly and nothing more needs to be said about it i cant see that you have proved anything unless you can show that it is impossible to spend a fortune innocently id have thought that the public welfare of a nation consists in the number and good condition of its inhabitants have you anything to object to this i think not which would contribute more to this end employing men in outdoor manly exercise or employing them in sedentary business within doors the former i suppose doesnt it seem to follow that building gardening and agriculture would employ men more usefully to the public than if tailors barbers perfumers distillers and the like were multiplied agreed but this goes against you because what incites men to build and plant is vanity and vanity is a vice but if a man were to build and plant meaning to employ people to build and plant for his convenience or pleasure in proportion to his fortune without foolish ostentation and without exaggerating the value of his house and garden they wouldnt be the effect of vice and how do you know that this cant happen the economic argument about whether and to what extent private vices are public benefits continues through many not very interesting pages with lysicles continuing to be stubborn and continuing not to understand the spirit in which crito extravagantly supports the minute philosophers positioneg talking of all the good that had been done by the fire in london and the injustice done to a freethinker who in a purely principled way murdered his father and was hanged for it they discuss a little the question of whether it is dangerous to publish such views the answer being that it is safe on the antireligious side of the minutephilosophy doctrine less so on the provice legal and political side lysicles says that he wants the whole governmental and legal structure overhauled in the light of the provice principles that freethinkers have discovered then you are it seems in favour of bringing about a thorough reformation as for what is commonly called the reformation i could never see how the world was the better for it protestantism is much the same as popery except for being more prudish and disagreeable a noted writer of ours calculates that the benefit of hooped petticoats is nearly equal to the benefit of the reformation but i think he is flattering it coming back to your question thorough reformation is thorough liberty leave nature absolutely free to work her own way and all will be well thats what we aim at our principles wont let us settle for less crito is a zealous protestant and when he heard lysicles passing jab at the reformation he couldnt refrain from joining in speaking his own mind rather than parodying the freethinkers the worst effect of the reformation he said was that it rescued wicked men from a darkness that had kept them in awe this has turned out to be holding out light to robbers and murderers and the light brought by the reformation may have done harm in another way too namely by encouraging freethinking it didnt have to do that light in itself is good and the light that shows a man the folly of popish superstition might also show him the truth of protestant religion and the madness of atheism but some people have used the light only to see the evils on one side roman catholicism and to run blindly into the arms of the worse evils of the opposite extreme atheism that was to make the best of things produce evil in the way that you show the worst things producing goodnamely accidentally or indirectly lysicles was a little disconcerted by critos emphatic tone but after a short pause he replied briskly that not everyone has the talent to think about the public good true said euphranor i also think that not everyone can frame a notion of the public good much less make good judgments about how to promote it but you lysicles who are a master of this subject please tell me doesnt the public good of a nation imply the particular good of its individuals it does and doesnt the good or happiness of a man consist in his having both soul and body sound and in good condition enjoying the things that their natures require and free from things that are odious or hurtful to them i dont deny that all this is true well it seems worthwhile to consider whether the regular decent life of a virtuous man mightnt be as conducive to this as the mad sallies of intemperance and debauchery ill admit that without the aid of vice a nation may merely survive be kept alive but it cant possibly flourish to get money and goods into rapid circulation in a state there must be extravagant and irregular motions in the appetites and passions the more people a nation contains and the happier they are the more that nation can be said to flourish i think we are agreed on this we are so you concede that riches are not an ultimate end but should be considered only as a means to happiness i do it seems that means cant be useful unless we know what the end is and how to apply the means to it it seems so doesnt it follow that in order to make a nation flourish it isnt enough to make it wealthy without knowing what the true end and happiness of mankind is and how to apply wealth towards achieving that end to the extent that these points are known and practised i think the nation would be likely to flourish but for a people who dont know or practise them gaining riches seems to me on a par with letting a sick man have plenty of food and drink which it will harm him to consume this is just sophistry it is arguing without persuading look into how in general people live their lives examine the pursuits of men have a due respect for the peoples ways of interacting and getting on with one another and youll soon be convinced that a nation can be made flourishing and happy through richesjust through riches give them wealth and they will make themselves happy without that political invention that trick of governments and philosophers called virtue in the next few pages which are not philosophically very nourishing the main topics of discussion are these whether virtue is a trick of governments which segment of the population should be listened to with respect lysicles responds to euphranors suggestion of country gentlemen and farmers and the better sort of tradesmen with blundering rudeness if people in general are so open to prejudice mightnt there be some prejudice in the minute philosophers position bodily health is a real objective state which can be driven up or down by what is done to the body why not an analogous view of spiritual or mental health here is how this last theme develops cant we suppose that there is such a state as a healthy constitution of the soulthe state it is in when its notions are right its judgments true its will regular its passions and appetites kept moderate and directed to the right objects and the man whose mind is so constituted isnt he properly called virtuous and shouldnt every good man try to produce this healthy disposition in the minds of his countrymen if these things have any appearance of truth as they seem to me to have it isnt so obvious that virtue is a mere whim or fashion or trick as you choose to say it is you took me by surprise when you said this i must admit given the conversation we had about this yesterday evening if you call that back to your mind it might perhaps save both of us some trouble frankly euphranor i admit to having forgotten everything you said about virtue duty and all that the points you made were of an airy notional nature which made them apt to vanish without leaving any trace in a mind that is accustomed to receiving impression only from realities at this euphranor looked at crito and me and said smiling i have been getting out of line my role was to learn and his to instruct then we have several pages about happiness and especially pleasure human pleasures versus animal ones higher pleasures versus lower ones transient pleasures versus more lasting ones and so on euphranor alludes to the sincerity the intensity and the duration of pleasures at one point lysicles rhapsodizes about the pleasures of cardplaying people of fashion couldnt live without cards they provide the most delightful way of passing an evening for an assemblage of gentlemen and ladies who otherwise wouldnt know what to say or do with themselves and a pack of cards doesnt merely give them something to do when they are together it also draws them together squaredancing gives them a pleasure to look forward to during the dull hours of the day they reflect on it with delight and it is something to talk about when it is over so the chief amusement of these people of fashion is an activity that any manual labourer can engage in being as well qualified to get pleasure from cards as a peer is it looks as though life is a drag for these people of fashion and that their fortunes arent doing them much good i can well imagine that when people of a certain sort are brought together they would prefer doing anything to the boredom of their own conversation but it isnt easy to think that theres any great pleasure in this play here playing cards for money is a serious amusement that brings relief to a man of pleasure after the more lively and affecting enjoyments of sense it kills time better than anything and is a most admirable antidote to redirect or prevent thoughts that might otherwise prey on the mind i can easily see that no man on earth ought to value antidotes for irritable boredom more than a man of fashion and pleasure an ancient sage speaking of someone of that sort says he is made wretched by disappointments and appetites and if this was true of the greeks who lived in the sun and had so much spirit im inclined to think its even truer of our modern englishmen theres something in our climate and our makeup that makes it especially true of us that idleness its own punishment an uneducated fine gentleman pays for his momentary pleasures with long and cruel intervals of being bored and out of sorts to relieve these he is driven into sensual excesses which further depress his spirits his low condition while creating a greater need for pleasures lessens his ability to enjoy them an englishmans cast of mind makes him the most unsuccessful rake in the world a rakea term that well meet several times moreis a man whose way of life is stylish and fashionable but also promiscuous and dissolute he is in aristotles phrase at odds with himself he isnt brute enough to enjoy his appetites or man enough to govern them he knows and feels that what he pursues is not his true good and when he looks inwards all he finds is the misery that his habitual sluggishness and idleness wont allow him to remedy eventually having grown odious to himself and hating his own company he joins any idle group that he can not in the hope of pleasure but merely to relieve the pain of his own mind listless and uneasy in the present he has no delight in reflecting on what is past or in the prospect of anything to come when after a wretched lifetime of vanity and woe his animal nature is worn to the stumps this man of pleasure alternates between wanting death and dreading it he is sick of living without ever having tried or known the true life of man ironically its just as well that this sort of life which is of so little benefit to its owner brings so much benefit to the public then some discussion of courage and of why there arent more disillusioned minute philosophers who commit suicide critos answer because they arent sure they are right about god and the afterlife then socrates who was no country parson suspected that your men of pleasure were such ie were men of pleasure through ignorance ignorance of what of the art of computing calculating as it were mathematically he thought that rakes cant do their sums and that because of this lack in their intellects they make wrong judgments about pleasure where their happiness depends on their making right ones i dont understand you do you agree that the senses perceive only sensible things i do and the senses perceive only things that are present i accept that too so pleasures of the understanding and future pleasures arent to be judged by the senses they are not so people who judge pleasures by the senses may find themselves mistaken at the bottom line he quotes some lines from the latin satirical poet persius about someone ending up with his joints ruined by gout so that his limbs are like brittle beechtree branches lamenting the way he has spent his life and depressed at the thought of the kind of life that lies ahead of him then to get the computation right shouldnt you consider all the faculties and all the kinds of pleasure taking the future into account as well as the present and rating them all according to their true value the epicureans held that a pleasure that produces a greater pain or that hinders a greater pleasure should be regarded as a pain and that a pain that produces a greater pleasure or prevents a greater pain is to be accounted a pleasure thus if we are to make a true estimate of pleasurethat great spring of action from which the conduct of life gets its directionwe have to compute intellectual pleasures and future ones as well as sensible pleasures and present ones and in estimating each particular pleasure we have to take into account all the pains and evils all the disgust remorse and shame that come with it and we ought to take account of the kind as well as the quantity of each pleasure let a freethinker merely consider how little human pleasure consists in actual sensation and how much in prospect then let him then compare the prospect of a virtuous believer with that of an unbelieving rake euphranor briefly joins in and lysicles responds sharply that the freethinkers calculate that what you call a good christian must be unfit for the worlds affairs thus while you compute yourselves out of pleasure others compute you out of business then further conversation about the personal characters of minute philosophers and then about how they spread their wordthe role of writers in this the effects on the young of freethinking ideassavage anecdotes about this by crito then wouldnt there always be rakes and rogues even if we didnt make them believe me the world always was and always will be the same as long as men are men i deny that the world is always the same human nature to use alciphrons comparison is like land better or worse depending on how it is managed and what seeds or principles are sown in it i agree there might be bad men through the force of corrupt appetites and unruly passions even if nobody accepted your tenets but when to the force of appetite and passion men add the force of opinion and are wicked on principle there will be more men who are wicked and they will be more incurably and outrageously wicked the error of a lively rake lies in his passions and may be reformed but the dry rogue who sets himself up in judgments is incorrigible more discussion of the characters of minute philosophers their place in history and other related topics then we have a maxim namely that each should take care of oneie should take care of himself alas lysicles you wrong your own character you minute philosophers want to get the world and yourselves to accept you as cunning selfinterested men but can anything be more disinterested not self interested than to give up all concern with the theoretical pursuit of truth can anything be less cunning than to publish your discoveries to the world teach others to play the whole game and arm mankind against yourselves re play the whole game see lysicles speech well in our dialect on page to you folk who are fired with love of truth and love of liberty and grasping the whole extent of nature i suggest that to those loves you add love of your country forgive me for introducing such a lowdown thought i would urge you to be cautious in the same way that all other discoverers projectors and makers of experiments are they never risk everything on the first trial wouldnt it be prudent to try the success of your principles on a small model in some remote corner of the earth for instance set up a colony of atheists in monomotapa in southern africa and see how it prospers before you proceed any further at home halfadozen shiploads of minute philosophers could easily be spared for such a good plan in the meantime you gentlemen who have discovered that theres nothing to be hoped or feared in an afterlife that conscience is a nagging pest that the bands of government and the cement of human society are rotten things that can be dissolved and crumbled into nothing by the arguments of any minute philosopher be so good as to keep these sublime discoveries to yourselves and allow all the rest of us to continue in the beliefs and ways of thinking established by the laws of our country speaking seriously i do wish you would try your experiments among the hottentots or turks we think well of the hottentots believing them to be an unprejudiced people but im afraid their diet and customs wouldnt agree with our philosophers as for the turks they are bigots who have a notion of god and a respect for jesus christ i doubt if it would be safe to venture among them then make your experiment in some other christian country we think that all other christian nations are much under the power of prejudice even our neighbours the dutch are too much prejudiced in favour of their religion which their law has established for a prudent man to attempt innovations under their government on the whole it seems that no country can offer as much security and prospect of success for our schemes as england does not to mention the fact that we have already made good progress the right way to start this experiment was to wipe out the prejudices of individual persons we have carried on this work for many years working hard and skillfully at first secretly as our principles gained acceptance and as our numbers grew we gradually revealed ourselves and our opinions and i neednt tell you where we have now come to we have grubbed and weeded and cleared human nature so thoroughly that before long youll see natural and sound ideas sprout up by themselves without any labouring or teaching crito reports the view of a wise man whom he doesnt name that the worst and most unwholesome weed was this same minute philosophy from there he moves to recounting a fable about a contest in hell to select the devil who could do most harm to humanity the runnerup appeared as gunpowder producing great noise and destruction and fear the winner set up as a pharmacist thus he passed as a friend and a physician through the world disguised himself with sweets and perfumes and drugs made his way into pharmacies and ladies cabinets and under a pretence of helping digestion comforting the spirits and cheering the heart he produced direct contrary effects and quietly and invisibly pushed great numbers of mankind into a fatal decay ie a decay that was fatal in the sense of being fated inevitable unstoppable he populated hell and the grave so fast that he earned the post of ruler of hell which he still holds those who please may amuse themselves with fables and allegories this is plain english liberty is a good thing and we are the support of liberty it seems to me that liberty and virtue were made for each other if someone wants to enslave his country the best preparation for that is vice and nothing leads to vice so surely as irreligion does i simply cant understand and i have tried how this hostility to religion can be an effect of honest views regarding a just and legal liberty let us examine what good your principles have done who has been the better for the instructions of these minute philosophers let us compare what we are in respect of learning loyalty honesty wealth power and public spirit with what we have been freethinking as it is called has grown amazingly in recent years let us see what has grown up along with it or as a result of it i shant list all the resultant ills that would be a nasty task and on the other side there is the only blessing that the minute philosophy can claim namely luxurythe same blessing that opened up ancient rome to the worlds revenge the same luxury that makes a nation look full and fat when it actually has one foot in the grave you have this wrong our sect think and argue better than anyone about the public good of a state and we have invented here discovered many things that are conducive to the public good but cant yet conveniently be put into practice but the public has received one advantage from the spread of your principles namely the old roman practice of selfmurder this puts an end to all distress stopping miserable people from going on being a burden to the world and to themselves you chose to make some remarks about this custom a little while ago page and to laugh at the irresolution of our freethinkers who couldnt make up their minds to kill themselves but i can tell you as a matter of fact that they have often recommended it by their example as well as by arguments and that it is solely because of them that this practice useful and magnanimous as it is has been taken out of the hands of lunatics and restored to the status among men of sense that it had in ancient times in whatever light you may look at it this is in fact a solid benefit but the best effect of our principles is the light and truth that they have so visibly spread through the world the number of prejudices errors perplexities and contradictions that we have cleared out of the minds of our fellowsubjects the number of hard words and intricate absurd notions that possessed the minds of men before our philosophers appeared in the world now even women and children have right and sound notions of things what do you say to this crito i say regarding these great advantages of destroying men and notions that i doubt that the public gains as much by the destruction of notions as it loses by the destruction of men speaking for myself i had rather my wife and children all had beliefs with no real thoughts behind them and daily pronounced words without a meaning than that any one of them should cut her throat or leap out of a window the public doesnt care much about errors and nonsense as such it is less concerned with whether a notion is metaphysically true than with whether it will tend to produce good or evil truth itself is valued by the public because it does have an influence and is felt in the course of life but the minute philosophers are not the men to whom we owe most for discoveries of that kind im making this point on the basis that your notions are in fact true and in fact i dont think they are candidly i think they are not only harmful but also false the tendency of your opinions is so bad that no good man can endure them and your arguments for them are so weak that no wise man will accept them hasnt it been provedas clear as the midday sunthat since the spreading of our principles the more smoothly civilised sort of men have led much happier lives and have been swimming in pleasure but i dont want to repeat things that i have already proved so ill add just one point our principles bring advantages even to very small children and to women they deliver children from terrors by night and ladies from intensely bored hours by day crito fiercely attacks this saying that we should compute what a liberated lady will give up against what she will get through the minute philosophy and that at the bottom line you shall find that empty giddy gaudy fluttering thing not half so happy as a butterfly or a grasshopper on a summers day similarly for the liberated man ending with this when his sense and appetite fade and he seeks refuge from his conscience in the minute philosophy the real truth about him is that he affects much believes little knows nothing lysicles makes couple of short interventions in the second of them saying that none of this will make our principles less true crito snaps back their truth is not what we are talking about our present topic is the usefulness of your principles and to decide this all we need is to get an overview of them fairly stated and laid side by side there is no god or providence man is as the beasts that perish mans happiness like that of the beasts consists in obeying animal instincts appetites and passions all stings of conscience and sense of guilt are prejudices and errors of upbringing religion is a state trick vice is beneficial to the public the soul of man is corporeal and dissolves like a flame or vapour man is a machine driven according to the laws of motion so he does not act and cant be guilty of anything a wise man evaluates and chooses all his actions in this life on the basis of his own individual selfinterest it seems that these opinions and others like them are the tenets of a minute philosopherwho is himself according to his own principles an organ played on by perceptible objects a ball swatted about by appetites and passions he is so acuteminded that he can maintain all this by skillful reasoning so sharpsighted and penetrating and deep that he can discover that the only true wisdom is the most selfinterested secret cunning to round out this charactersketch this ingenious piece of clockwork having no source of action within itself and denying that it has or can have a single free thought or motion sets itself up as the protector of liberty and argues earnestly for freethinking the moment crito stopped speaking lysicles addressed himself to euphranor and me crito he said has taken a vast amount of trouble but has convinced me of only one solitary thing namely that i havent a hope of convincing him never in my whole life have i met with a man so deeply immersed in prejudice i leave it others to pull him out of the mire but i have better hopes of convincing you speaking for myself i said i can answer that my eyes and ears are always open to conviction i attend to everything that is said and my overall final judgment whether right or wrong will at least be quite impartial crito is bolder than i am undertaking in this way to scold and lecture a philosopher for my part i always find it easier to learn than to teach so ill ask for your help in ridding me of some worries about the practical effects of your opinionsa topic that i havent been able to get on top of though ever so willing when this is done perhaps we still wont tread in exactly the same steps perhaps we wont even walk on the same road but we shant keep coming into direct collision with one another he then presents a set of feeble examples in support of the general thesis that extremes lead to opposite extremes in the natural world and alsohe addsin the civil world where power produces licence and licence produces power bigots make atheists and atheists make bigots the threat is that if the success of the minute philosophy leads to lax government and great licentiousness there will be a reaction taking the country to the opposite extreme of something like what we might call fascism euphranor then launches into another worry that i have about the tendency of your opinions it is than an england cleansed of protestant christianity would create a spiritual vacuum not his phrase that would be filled by many subtle and effective covert missionaries for roman catholicism lysicles replies that the minute philosophers dont prefer any religion to any other and that if roman catholicism became the enforced orthodoxy of england they would all go along with it and what about their minute philosophy oh we should have more than ever of that for we should keep it all to ourselves crito remarks that the minute philosophers tend to make friends of the jesuits ignorantly unaware that the jesuits are subtle and sophisticated enough to make dupes of the minute philosophers then here crito paused and fixed his eyes on alciphron who during this whole conversation had sat thoughtful and attentive without saying a word sometimes seeming dissatisfied at what lysicles advanced at other times apparently serene and pleased as though approving some better thought of his own but the day was now far advanced and alciphron proposed to adjourn the argument till the following day then he said i shall put matters on a new foundation and in a light that is so full and clear that i am sure it will give entire satisfaction so we switched to talk about other things ate our picnic meal strolled on the beach and returned to critos home in the cool of the evening third dialogue wednesday the following day as we sat around the teatable in a summer parlour facing the garden alciphron turned down his cup sat back in his chair and said our sect is the only one on earth that has the special privilege of not being tied down by any principles while other philosophers declare themselves to be committed to certain doctrines ours assert a noble freedomdiffering from one another and often a single philosopher differing from himself among its other advantages this method of proceeding makes us of all men the hardest to refute you may show a particular tenet of ours to be wrong but this affects only those who maintain that thesis and only for as long as they maintain it some freethinkers dogmatize more than others do and on some points more than on others the doctrine of the usefulness of vice is something we are not all agreed on some of us are great admirers of virtue others have problems regarding vice and virtue speaking for myself i think that the doctrine maintained yesterday by lysicles is an ingenious bit of theory but for various reasons im inclined not to accept it and rather to join the virtue side in that debate that puts me in the company of a very small part of our sect but it may be the most thoughtful and praiseworthy part of it anyway after looking into it fairly and very carefully i think that we ought to prefer virtue to vice and that in doing so we would be doing good things for the public and for the reputation of our philosophers so you should know that a number of freethinkersmen who havent a grain of religion in their makeupare men of the most scrupulous honour which makes them men of virtue honour is a noble unpolluted source of virtue with absolutely no fear selfinterest or superstition mixed in with it it has all the advantages of religion with none of the drawbacks see qa note on page i so honour is the source of virtue ii a thing cant be the source of itself iii so the source has to be distinguished from whatever it is the source of iv so honour is one thing and virtue is another i agree virtuous actions are the effect and honour is their source or cause tell me now what the role of honour is in this is honour the will that produces the virtuous actions as their efficient cause or the final cause for which they are produced or right reason that governs and controls them or what the actions are about or do you use honour to stand for a faculty or appetite each of these is supposed to be in one way or another a source of human actions honour is none of them then please give me some notion or definition of it alciphron thought for a while and then answered that he defined honour to be a principle of virtuous actions euphranor replied as i understand it the word principle has several senses a sometimes by principles we mean the parts of which a whole is composed and into which it can be resolved or analysed its in this sense that the elements are called principles of compound bodies and words and syllables and letters are the principles of speech b sometimes by principle we mean a small individual seed the growth or gradual unfolding of which produces an organic body animal or vegetable in its proper size and shape c principles in other contexts are supposed to be certain fundamental theorems in arts and sciences in religion and politics now when you say honour is a principle of virtue in which if any of these sense are you using principle alciphron replied that he didnt mean it in any of those senses and that he defined honour to be a certain ardour or enthusiasm that glowed in the breast of a gallant man at that time enthusiasm tended to mean something close to fanaticism which sometimes replaces it in this version in the present context however it is safer to let the word stand euphranor remarked that it is always legitimate to put a definition in place of the term defined is this allowed he asked it is then cant we say that a man of honour is an ardent or heated man or an enthusiast alciphron replied that theres no point in such exactness that pedants may dispute and define but they can never reach the high sense of honour that distinguishes the fine gentleman this honour he said was a thing to be felt rather than explained crito seeing that alciphron couldnt bear being pressed any further on that matter and wanting to give some satisfaction to euphranor said that he wouldnt undertake to explain such a delicate matter but that he would repeat to them part of a conversation he once heard between a minute philosopher and a christian on the same subject the reported dialogue which is quite short represents the freethinkers honour as a disgracefully meagre affair pretty much limited to paying ones gambling debts and engaging in duels when challenged i dont want the opinion of someone of whom i know nothing tell me your own judgment about what honour is based on your own observations of men of honour well from everything that i have heard or seen i could never find that honourconsidered as an actionstimulus distinct from conscience religion reason and virtuewas anything but an empty name i really do think that those who base their conduct on the notion of honour have less virtue than other men and that what they seem to have as their substitute for virtue is derived either from the fashion of the day or from a conscience that has without their knowing it retained faint traces of the religious principles that were drummed into them in their childhood these two principles sources seem to account for everything that in those gentlemen men of fashion who are full of animal life are blustering braggarts when it comes to morality they would blush to let anyone think that they are afraid of conscience they go on about honour and want to be known as men of honour rather than as conscientious or honest men but so far as i can see this shiny glow of honour with nothing of conscience or religion beneath it to give it life and substance is no better than a meteor or sunset cloud i had a confused idea that honour had a lot to do with truth and that men of honour were the greatest enemies of all hypocrisy falsehood and disguise quite the contrary an unbeliever who thinks he has the most scrupulous honour without having the least grain of faith or religion will pretend to be a christiantake any test join in any act of worship kneel pray receive the sacramentall to serve his own selfinterest he wont feel that his honour is at stake when he solemnly declares and promises in the face of god and the world that he will love his wife and forsaking all others keep only to her while having not the faintest intention of keeping any part of his vowas he shows to everyone as soon as he gets her and her money in his power we had a notion here in the country that calling a man of honour a liar was the nastiest thing one could do and a very risky thing to do that is very true such a man doesnt mind lying but he hates to be called a liar alciphron having peacefully heard all this said the term freethinker covers men of very different sorts and sentiments so that freethinkers cant be said strictly to constitute a single sect with a particular system of positive and distinct opinions we do indeed all agree on certain points of unbelief certain negative principles and this agreement does in a way bring us together under the common idea of one sect but those negative principles as they take root in men who differ in age temperament and upbringing produce a wide variety of tendencies opinions and characters dont think that our greatest strength lies in the libertines and mere men of honour who constitute the majority of us no we have among us philosophers of a very different type enquiring thinkers who are governed not by such crude things as sense and custom but by highly principled virtue and elevated moralsand the less religious they are the more virtuous an unbeliever is the best qualified person for virtue of the high and disinterested not self interested kind because it is a lowdown and selfish thing to be virtuous through fear or hope as believers are the notion of a god who maintains a future state of rewards and punishments may indeed tempt or scare cowardly men into behaviour that is contrary to the natural tendency of their souls but it will never produce genuine virtue to get to the bottom of things to analyse virtue into its ultimate elements and settle a scheme of morals on its true basis you have to grasp that an idea of beauty is natural to the mind of man all men want beauty they are pleased and delighted with it for its own sake purely from an instinct of nature a man doesnt need arguments to make him identify and approve what is beautiful it strikes him at first sight and attracts him without a reason and just as this beauty is found in the physical features of material things so also theres a different though analogous kind of beautyan order a symmetry a handsomenessin the moral world and just as the eye perceives one sort of beauty so does the mind by a certain interior sense perceive the other sort and this sense talent or faculty is always sharpest and purest in the noblest minds just as we unhesitatingly pronounce a dress to be fine or a physical movement graceful we can with the same free untutored judgment tell straight off whether someones behaviour is beautiful to detect and enjoy this kind of beauty you need a delicate and fine taste but when someone has this natural taste thats all he needs he has no need for anything else as a principle to convince him of the value of beauty or as a motive to induce him to love virtue and every rational creature has something of this taste or sense though in varying degrees all rational beings are by nature social they are drawn towards one another by natural affections they unite into families clubs parties and commonwealths by mutual sympathy just as the various parts of our body guided by the sensitive soul contribute to our animal functions and are connected to make one whole organism so also the various parts of these rational systems guided by this moral or interior sense are held together have a fellow feeling do support and protect each other and jointly cooperate towards a single end thats the source of our joy in society our inclination towards doing good to our kind the approval and delight we have when we see other mens virtuous deeds or think back on our own by thinking about the fitness and order of the parts of a moral system operating regularly and held together by benevolent affections the mind of man achieves the highest notion of beauty excellence and perfection held by this sublime idea our philosophers infinitely despise and pity anyone who proposes or accepts any other motive to virtue selfinterest is a lowdown and ungenerous thing destroying the merit of virtue and falsehood of every kind is inconsistent with the genuine spirit of philosophy so your love for moral beauty and your passion for truth as such wont let you patiently endure those fraudulent impositions upon mankind god the immortality of the soul and rewards and punishments in an afterlife which purport to promote virtue but really destroy it destroy true virtue and at the same time contradict and belittle your noble theories thus tending to disturb and agitate mens minds and fill them with doomed hopes and empty terrors mens first thoughts and natural notions are the best in moral matters mankind doesnt need to be preached or reasoned or frightened into virtue which is such a natural and congenial thing for every human soul and if this is the caseas it certainly isit follows that all societys aims are secured without religion and that an unbeliever offers promise of being the most virtuous man in a true sublime and heroic sense while you say these things alciphron i feel a state of my soul like the trembling of one lute when the unison strings of another are plucked doubtless there is a beauty of the mind a charm in virtue a symmetry and proportion in the moral world the ancients knew this moral beauty by the name of honestum if we want to know what its force and influence are it may be worthwhile to inquire how it was understood and depicted by those who first considered it and gave it a name honestum according to aristotle is what is praiseworthy according to plato it is what is pleasant or profitablemeaning pleasant to a reasonable mind and profitable to its true interest euphranor gives the key words here in greek as well as in english or in one case honestum latin see qa note on page i when we think of an action as praiseworthy our thought goes beyond the bare action itself and takes in the opinion of others concerning it ii so this isnt a sufficient basis or source of virtue for a man to act on in a case where he thinks that his conduct cant be observed by any other thinking being iii when a man does something because he finds it pleasant or profitable we have to think that hell refrain from doing itor even do its oppositeif that has a prospect of greater pleasure or profit iv so it follows from this that the beauty of virtue in either aristotles or platos sense is not sufficient to get sensual and worldlyminded men to act virtuously v so it follows that hope of reward and fear of punishment are extremely useful in getting the balance of pleasant and profitable to swing down on the side of virtue thus bringing much benefit to human society alciphron appealed gentlemen you are witnesses of this unfair proceeding of euphranors who argues against us on the basis of platos and aristotles accounts of the beauty of virtue accounts that have nothing to do with our views the philosophers of our sect rise above all praise pleasure and selfinterest when they are captured and bowled over by the sublime idea of the beauty of virtue i apologise replied euphranor for supposing that todays minute philosophers think like those ancient sages but tell me alciphron since you dont adopt platos or aristotles account of it what do you understand the beauty of virtue to be define it explain it make me understand your meaning that so we can argue about the same thing if we dont do that well never reach a conclusion some things are better understood by definitions and descriptions but i have always observed that those who do least well concerning the beauty of virtue are those who try to define explain and dispute about it moral beauty is so unique and abstract so subtle fine and fleeting that it doesnt survive being handled and inspected like a jug or a boot so youll have to allow me my philosophic liberty to take my stand within the general and indefinite sense rather than entering into a precise and detailed account of this beauty possibly losing sight of it and also possibly giving you leverage for criticizing and inferring and raising doubts queries and difficulties about something thats as clear as the sun when nobody reasons upon it are you then saying alciphron that the notion of moral beauty is clearest when it is not thought about i say that its something to be felt rather than understood a certain je ne sais quoi french i dont know what we engage with it not through our conceptmanaging capacities but through a special sense which is properly called the moral sense because it is adapted to the perception of moral beauty as the eye is adapted to colours or the ear to sounds i have no doubt that men naturally have certain instinctive sensations or emotions that make them amiable and useful to each other examples are fellowfeeling with the distressed tenderness for our offspring affection towards our friends our neighbours and our country indignation against what is base cruel or unjust these emotions are implanted in the human soul along with various other factorsfears and appetites aversions and desireswith different minds differing in which of these are strongest and uppermost doesnt it then seem to be a very uncertain guide in morals for a man to follow his emotion or inward feeling if this were the general rule wouldnt it be sure to lead different men in different directions depending on which appetite or emotion was prevalent i dont deny that and doesnt it also follow that duty and virtue are more likely to be practised if men are led by reason and judgment balancing low and sensual pleasures against those of a higher kind present losses against future gains and the discomfort and disgust of every vice against the delightful practice of the opposite virtue and the pleasing thoughts and hopes that go with it or can there be a stronger motive to virtue than the belief that all things considered it is in every mans true selfinterest i tell you euphranor we despise the virtue of the man who calculates and deliberates and must have a reason for being virtuous the refined moralists among the freethinkers are enchanted and carried away by the abstract beauty of virtue they love virtue only for its own sake try an experiment on the first man you meet propose to him a villainous or unjust action get his initial sense of the matter and youll find that he detests it he may indeed later on be misled by arguments or overpowered by temptation but his original unpremeditated genuine thoughts are right and orthodox how can we account for this except through a moral sense which when left to itself has as quick and true a perception of the beauty and ugliness of human actions as the eye has of colours mightnt this be adequately explained in terms of conscience affection emotion education reason custom religion for all i know those sources of moral behaviour may be what you metaphorically call a moral sense what i call a moral sense is strictly literally and truly a sense and is different in kind from all the things you have just listed all men have it though some may fail to be aware of it in themselves euphranor smiled and said alciphron has made discoveries where i least expected him to in regard to everything else i would hope to learn from him but for knowledge of myself of the faculties and powers of my own mind i would have looked at home and i might have looked there for a good long time without finding this new talent even now after being tutored i still cant understand it i must say that alciphron speaks in a way that is too highflown and obscure for a topic that ought to be the most clearly understood of all i have often heard that your deepest experts and oldest and most experienced theoreticians are the most obscure lysicles is young and speaks plainly if he would favour us with his view of the moral sense that might perhaps be nearer to a level at which i can understand lysicles shook his head and in a solemn and earnest manner addressed us all gentlemen he said alciphron stands on his own legs i have no part in these refined notions he is now committed to defending if i must subdue my emotions take things in an abstract way think deeply love virtuein short if i must be an enthusiastthe deference i owe to the laws of my country make me choose to be an enthusiast in their way besides it is better to be an enthusiast for some end than to be an enthusiast for none this doctrine of virtue based not on religion but on a moral sense has all the solid inconveniences of the christian doctrine without its distracting hopes and prospects i wasnt counting on lysicles to back me up in this matter which after all doesnt need his help different topics require different treatments a subject may be too obscure for the dry and pedantic method of definition and distinctiondrawing or it may be too simple for it and we may know too little about a subject to be able to make it plainer by talking about it or we may know too much for further talk to be any help for my part i believe that if matters were fairly stated the rational satisfaction the peace of mind the inward comfort and conscientious joy that a good christian finds in good actions would not be found to fall short of all the ecstasy rapture and enthusiasm that are supposed to come from that high and undescribed source the moral sense seriously can any ecstasy be higher any rapture more affecting than what comes from the love of god and man from a conscience clear of sins from an inward discharge of duty with the secret delight trust and hope that go along with it o euphranor we who are devoted to the truth dont envy the groundless joys and mistaken hopes of a christianwe pity them and as for conscience and rational pleasure how can we allow a conscience without allowing a vindictive god and how can we suppose that the charm of virtue consists in any pleasure or benefit that comes from virtuous actions without thereby giving great advantages to the christian religion which seems to arouse its believers to virtue by the selfinterested pursuit of the highest pleasures as rewards alas if we granted this we would be opening the door to all those rusty old speeches about the necessity and usefulness of the great articles of faith the immortality of the soul an afterlife rewards and punishments and other such exploded notions according to our system and principles those factors may perhaps produce a low popular selfinterested kind of virtue but it is bound to destroy and extinguish virtue in the sublime and heroic sense of the word what youre saying now is perfectly intelligible i wish i understood your main principle as well so you are seriously at a loss can you really have no notion of beauty or have it but not know beauty to be lovable in itself and for itself tell me alciphron do all mankind have the same notion of a beautiful face the physical beauty of human beings seems to be rather mixed and various but isnt there a steady standard of beauty with regard to other things doesnt every human mind have the idea of order harmony and proportion o alciphron its a weakness of mine that i tend to get lost when the talk is abstract and general particular things are better suited to my faculties so let us stay with the objects of the senses and try to discover what it is that makes them beautiful and then using these sensible things as a ladder climb to the level of moral and intellectual beauty so please tell me what is it that we call beauty in the objects of sense alciphrons answer would as euphranor points out allow for beauty in tastes and smells so he tries again with an account that limits beauty to what can be seen alciphron after a short pause said that beauty consisted in a certain symmetry or proportion pleasing to the eye is this proportion the very same in everything or is it different in different kinds of things different doubtless the proportions of an ox would not be beautiful in a horse and we see also in inanimate things that the beauty of a table a chair a door consists in different proportions see qa note on page i this proportion implies the relation of one thing to another ii and these relations are based on size and shape iii for the proportions to be right those mutual relations of size and shape in the parts must be such as to make the whole thing complete and perfect in its kind iv a thing is said to be perfect in its kind when it fits the purpose for which it was made v so the parts have to be related and adjusted to one another in such a way that they can best work together to make the whole thing work properly vi but comparing parts with one another viewing them as belonging to one whole and relating this whole to its use or purpose seems to be the work of reason vii so strictly speaking proportions are not perceived by the sense of sight but only by reason through the means of sight viii so beauty in your sense of it is an object not of the eye but of the mind ix so the eye alone cant see that a chair is handsome or a door well proportioned that seems to follow but im not clear on this point lets see if theres any difficulty in it that chair you are sitting in do you think it could be regarded as wellproportioned or handsome if it didnt have that height depth breadth and wasnt adjusted so as to be comfortable to sit in it could not so the beauty or symmetry of a chair cant be taken in unless you know what the chair is for and relate its shape to that intended use and that cant be done by the eye aloneits work for the judgment so it is one thing to see an object and another to detect its beauty i admit this to be true he now repeats the point with the example of a door the standards for what makes a door beautifully proportioned reflect the fact that doors are for humans to go through alciphron agrees then tell me alciphron isnt there something truly decent and beautiful in dress no doubt there is if we want to get an idea of beauty in dress is anyone more likely to give it to us than painters and sculptors whose business it is to aim at graceful representations i believe not well then lets examine the draperies of the great masters in these arts for example how they were accustomed to clothe a matron or a man of rank he then launches into a fierce attack on current standards of dress the greeks and romans dressed themselves in a becoming manner whereas our gothic gentry have adopted standards and fashions that are absurd and ridiculous the reason for this and alciphron agrees is that instead of consulting use reason and convenience the moderns have gone in for fancy the unnatural parent of monsters he concludes that the beauty of dress depends on its serving certain ends and uses euphranor then launches into a fresh set of examples quoting virgil on a beautiful horse and then reporting ancient greek ideas about what makes a pillar beautiful there follows a long speech about architectural standards all of which is aimed at showing the subordinate relative nature of beauty architectural beauty he says reflects not only the use to which the building is to be put but also certain relationships to natural thingseg the proportions that make for beauty in a greek pillar have a definite relationship to the proportions of a wellshaped human body euphranor sums up the grand distinction between ancient greek and gothic architecture is that the gothic is fantastical and mostly not based on nature or reason necessity or use these being what account for all the beauty grace and ornament of the architecture of ancient greece what euphranor has said confirms the opinion i always entertained that the rules of architecture as of all other arts that flourished among the greeks were based on truth and nature and good sense he then expounds the point that the ancients didnt adhere slavishly to their rules of proportion etc being willing to depart from them whenever the particular distance position elevation or dimension of the building or its parts seemed to require it he contrasts careful and rational departure from rules with the capricious fantasticalness of contemporary architecture now i need something to be made clearernamely what the point is of this architectural detour werent we enquiring into beauty we were well what do you think alciphrondoesnt some real principle of beauty have to be at work when something pleases us here and now and also gave pleasure two thousand years ago and two thousand miles away yes it does and isnt that how things stand with respect to a sound piece of architecture nobody denies it architecture the noble offspring of judgment and fancy was gradually formed in the most civilised and informed countries of asia and in egypt greece and italy it was valued and admired by the most flourishing states and most renowned monarchs who at vast expense improved it and brought it to perfection it seems more than any other art to be specially involved with order proportion and symmetry so isnt it reasonable for us to think that architecture is the art that is most likely to help us get some rational notion of the je ne sais quoi in beauty and havent we learned from our detour that there is no beauty without proportion and that proportions are to be judged as sound and true only to the extent that they relate appropriately to some certain use or purposethis potential usefulness being what basically makes them please and charm i admit all this to be true in the next three speeches principle is used in a sense related to b in euphranors speech on pages think of it as meaning approximately generator or source of energy given this doctrine id like to know what beauty can be found in a moral system that has been formed tied together and governed by chance fate or any other blind unthinking principle without thought there can be no purpose or design without a purpose there cant be any usefulness and without usefulness there cant be any of the fitness of proportion from which beauty springs cant we suppose that the world is permeated throughout by a certain vital principle of beauty order and harmony without supposing a god who inspects punishes and rewards the moral actions of men without supposing the immortality of the soul or an afterlifein brief without accepting any part of what is commonly called faith worship and religion is this principle that you are supposing a thinking one or not if not then it is all of a piece with chance or fate which was argued against a moment ago if it does think then id like alciphron to tell me what is so beautiful in a moral system headed by a supreme thinking being that doesnt protect the innocent punish the wicked or reward the virtuous he goes on eloquently and at length about the beauty of a moral system in which everyone sees himself as the member of a great city whose author and founder is god and where all conduct aims at the noblest end namely the complete happiness or wellbeing of the whole then there will be great beauty in a system of spirits that are subordinate to gods will and under his direction with him governing them by laws and directing them by methods that are suitable to wise and good ends but how can there be beauty in an incoherent system that is governed by chance or in a blind system that is governed by fate or in any system where god doesnt preside where there is no thought there is no design and therefore no order and therefore no beauty contrast these two scenes a man is conscious that his will is inwardly conformed to gods will which produces order and harmony in the universe and conducts the whole by the most just methods to the best end that gives a beautiful idea but then a man is conscious that his virtue is overlooked neglected or held against him by men and not regarded or rewarded by god that this world has treated him badly and he has no hope or prospect of being better treated in another world wheres the beauty in that what pleasure can we get from thinking about it and how could any sane person think that spreading this idea of our moral situation is the way to spread or propagate virtue in the world an enthusiast may entertain himself with visions and fine talk about such a system but when it comes to be considered by careful thinkers with cool heads i dont think they will find any beauty or perfection in it and they wont think that such a moral system can possibly be the work of the same divine hand as the natural world throughout which there shines so much order harmony and proportion all this serves to confirm me in my opinion i said earlier page that regarding this highlevel beauty of morality a mans first thoughts are best and that well risk losing sight of it if we examine inspect and reason about it that there is such a thing cant be doubted when we realize that some of our philosophers today have a high sense of virtue without the least notion of religion that is a clear proof of the usefulness and effectiveness of our principles granting that some minute philosophers are virtuous we may venture to question the cause of their virtue you attribute it to an inexplicable enthusiastic notion of moral beauty i think it comes as euphranor said from personal temperament custom and religious education but anyway assign what beauty you please to virtue in an irreligious system it cant be less in a religious one unless you hold that virtues charms diminish as her dowry increases take all the motives of every sort that an unbeliever can possibly get from the beauty of virtue a believer can have them too as well as other motives that an unbeliever doesnt have so it is obvious that those of your sect who have moral virtue dont get it from their special freethinking doctrines which serve only to lessen the motives to virtue good freethinkers are less good and bad ones are more bad than they would have been if they were believers it seems to me that those heroic unbelieving lovers of abstract moral beauty are much to be pitied and much to be amazed by lysicles broke in impatiently gentlemen he said you shall have my whole thoughts about this topic plain and unvarnished everything that is said about a moral sense or about moral beauty in any meaning of that phrase whether said by alciphron or euphranor or anyone else i regard as basically mere windowdressing and pretence the beautiful and the decent are outward things and are relative and superficial they have no effect in the dark as they would if there were something solid about them they are merely showpieces to argue over and make speeches about as some of the selfannounced members our sect are accustomed to doing orthodox though they are about other things but if one of them got into power you wouldnt find him such a fool as euphranor imagines he would soon show that he had learned that the love of ones country is a prejudice that mankind are rogues and hypocrites and that it would be folly to sacrifice oneself for the sake of the likes of them that everything that matters relates to this life and that because to every man this life means his own life it clearly follows that charity begins at home claims are made of benevolence to mankind but what wise people put into practice is benevolence to themselves among our freethinker philosophers the livelier ones dont hesitate to accept these maxims openly and as for the more solemn ones we can guess what they must really think if they are true to their principles whatever effect pure theory may have on certain minority of very unusual minds or in some other parts of the world i really do think that in england now reason religion and law are all together little enough to get people to act in accordance with their consciences and that it would be downright stupid to think that without reason religion and law men would be in love with the golden mean ie in love with a temperate way of life one in which extremes are avoided indeed my countrymen may be even less inclined to be like that than others are because in the makeup of an english mind there is a certain hot eagerness that carries us to the sad extremein religion to fanaticism in freethinking to atheism in liberty to rebellion he goes on to say that the english like other northern people dont go in for beauty much and when they try they make a hash of it winding up but in no case is it to be hoped that the beautiful he says it in greek will be the leading idea of the great majority who have quick senses strong emotions and blunt intellects the fewer they are the more we should respect and admire such philosophers whose souls are transported by this sublime idea of moral beauty but then one might expect from such philosophers enough good sense and philanthropy to make them keep their tenets to themselves and consider the situation of their weak brethren who are more strongly affected by notions of another kind than that of the beauty of pure disinterested virtue consider the example of cratylus what follows is aimed at the third earl of shaftesbury who is berkeleys targetnot always fairly treatedthrough much of this work he was prejudiced against the christian religion was of an unsound constitution had a rank in society higher than most men can even aim at had a fortune equal to his rank had little capacity for sensual vices or temptation to dishonest ones he talked himself or thought he had into a stoic enthusiasm about the beauty of virtue then under the pretence of making men heroically virtuous he tried by undermining religion to destroy the means of making them reasonably and humanly so this is a clear example of the fact that neither birth nor books nor conversation can introduce a knowledge of the world into a conceited mind that will attend only to itself and look at mankind only in its own mirror cratylus was a lover of liberty and of his country he aimed to make men uncorrupt and virtuous on the purest and most disinterested principles its true that the main aim of all his writings as he himself tells us was to assert the reality of a beauty and charm in moral subjects as well as in natural ones to demonstrate a taste that he thinks more effective than principle to recommend morals on the same basis as manners and in this way to make progress in moral philosophy by giving it the same basis as the notions of what is agreeable and socially acceptable as for religious qualms the belief in an afterlife of rewards and punishments and such matters this great man doesnt hesitate to declare that the liberal polished and refined part of mankind must consider them only as childrens tales and pastimes of the vulgar so for the sake of the better sort of people he has in his great goodness and wisdom thought of something else namely a taste or flavour this he assures us is something that will influence people because according to him anyone who has any impression of gentility or polish is so acquainted with the fittingness and grace of things as to be easily bowled over by the thought of it his conduct seems to be about as wise as that of a monarch who announces that in his kingdom there is no jail and no executioner to enforce the laws but that it is beautiful to obey the laws and that in doing so men will taste the pure delight that results from order and decorum yet isnt it true that certain ancient philosophers ones of great noteheld the same opinion as cratylus declaring that noone counts as a good man if he practises virtue for any reason except that it is beautiful yes i think some of the ancients said things that gave rise to this opinion aristotle distinguishes between two ways in which someone can be a good manone he calls agathos or simply good the other he calls kalos kagathos these are hard to translate into english but his sense is plainly this agathos is the man to whom the good things of nature are good according to aristotle things that are vulgarly regarded as the greatest goodsriches honours power and bodily perfectionsare indeed good by nature and yet they happen to be hurtful and bad to some people because of their bad habits so that those natural goods are not good for a fool an unjust man or an intemperate man any more than a sick man is helped by getting nourishment that is proper for those who are in good health and kalos kagathos is the man in whom are to be found all things worthy and decent and praiseworthy purely as such and for their own sake and who practises virtue solely because of his love of virtues innate beauty aristotle also observes that there is a certain political way of thinking and behaving that the spartans and others had who thought that virtue was to be valued and practised because of the natural advantages that come with it this makes them good men he says but they dont have the supreme consummate virtue this makes it clear that according to aristotle someone can be a good man without believing that virtue its own reward or being moved to virtue only by the sense of moral beauty its also clear that he distinguishes the political virtue of nations which the public is everywhere concerned to maintain from this highminded and theoretical kind of virtue notice also that his highlevel kind of virtue was consistent with supposing a providence that inspects and rewards the virtues of the best men he says if the gods care at all about human affairs as they seem to it seems reasonable to suppose that they are most delighted with the part of our nature that is most excellent and most like their own natures namely our minds and that they will reward those who chiefly love and cultivate what is most dear to them he remarks that the majority of mankind are naturally inclined to be awed not by shame but by fear and to abstain from vicious conduct not because of its ugliness but only because of the punishment it brings all this shows us very clearly what aristotle would have thought of those who would set to work to lessen or destroy mankinds hopes and fears in order to make them virtuous purely because of the beauty of virtue well whatever aristotle and his followers thought isnt it certain that the stoics maintained this doctrine in its highest sense asserting that the beauty of virtue is allsufficient that virtue is her own reward that only virtue could make a man happy despite all the things that are vulgarly regarded as the greatest woes and miseries of human life and they held all this while also believing that the soul of man is some kind of material thing which at death is dissipated like a flame or vapour yes the stoics do sometimes talk as if they believed the soul to be mortal in dealing with this topic in one of his letters seneca speaks much like a minute philosopher but in several other places he declares himself to have the outright opposite opinion asserting that mens souls after death rise into the heavens and look down on earth crito then talks learnedly about marcus aurelius he sometimes speaks of the soul as perishing or scattering but for him the soul was a rather low part of a man to be distinguished from his mind or governing principle at a mans death according to him the mind remains intact it is a particle of god which goes back whole to the stars and the divinity concluding thus along with all his magnificent lessons and splendid views about the force and beauty of virtue marcus is positive about the existence of god in the strict sense of a providence inspecting and taking care of human affairs despite their high style therefore the stoics cant be said to have reduced every motive for living virtuously to just onethe beauty of virtuein such a way as to attempt to destroy peoples belief in the immortality of the soul and a providence that hands out rewards and punishments and anyway supposing that the disinterested stoics did make virtue its own and its only reward taking this in the most rigid and absolute sense what does that imply for those of us who are not stoics if we adopt all the principles of that sect accepting their notions of good and evil their famous indifference to sufferingin short setting ourselves up as complete stoicsthat may enable us to maintain this doctrine of virtue for its own sake with a better grace at least it will fit consistently into our whole stoic scheme of things but if you borrow this splendid patch from the stoics hoping to make a big impression by inserting it into a modern composition spiced with the wit and notions of the present day youll make an impression all right but on the mind of a wise man it may not be the impression you intended though i must admit that although embroidering a stoic patch with jokes ought to make you look ridiculous you might get away with it because the present age is very indulgent to everything that aims at mockery of religion not everyone likes humorous writings and not everyone can produce them the truth is that the variety in readers tastes requires a variety of kinds of writers our sect has provided for this with great judgment to spread our word to people of the more serious sort we have men who can reason and argue deeply and well for the runofthemill general reading public we have writers who produce lengthy rhetorically persuasive pieces and for men of rank and social polish we have the finest and wittiest mockers in the world whose ridicule is the sure test of truth this refers to shaftesbury who in his book characteristics of men manners opinions times wrote about wit and humour in philosophy see qa note on page i no doubt that ingenious mockers are knowledgeable men ii they know about the copernican theory of the planets the circulation of the blood and so on iii they believe that there is land in the far south of the southern hemisphere that there are mountains on the moon that the earth moves iv if five or six centuries ago a man had maintained these notions among the clever wits at an english court they would have been received with ridicule v whereas now it would be ridiculous to ridicule them vi yet truth was the same then as it is now vii so it seems that ridicule is not such a secure test of truth as you gentlemen imagine one thing we do know our mockery and sarcasm infuriate the black tribe of priests and theologians and that is our comfort something else that it may be worthwhile for you to know men who are doubled over with laughter may be applauding a piece of mockery that theyll find contemptible when they recover from their laughing fit well anyway this much is certain our clever men make converts by deriding the principles of religion and i can assure you that mockery is the most successful and pleasing method of convincing someone these authors laugh men out of their religion as the latin poet horace laughed them out of their vices but a bigot cant enjoy their witindeed he cant detect it crito speaks slightingly of wit without wisdom then moves back to the centre of their topic of conversation citing examples from ancient rome of good able people whose attitude to virtue involved their belief in an afterlife in which virtue is rewarded alciphron replies that these men were very well for their times but that they didnt achieve the highlevel kind of virtue that our modern freethinkers have so it should seem that virtue flourishes more than ever among us it should and this abundant virtue is to be explained by the way in which your profound writers went about recommending it this i grant but you have admitted that enthusiastic lovers of virtue are not a majority in your sect but only a small select minority alciphron didnt answer this but crito stepped in to make a true estimate of the worth and growth of modern virtue he said to euphranor what you should go by is not the number of virtuous men but rather the quality of their virtue and the virtue of these refined freethinking theorists is so pure and genuine that a very little of it goes a long way in fact it is invaluable theres no comparison between it and the reasonable selfinterested virtue of the english of earlier times or of the spartans turns of phrase which could mean that this kind of morality is very powerful and so wonderful as to be above all price and incomparably better than the morality of the spartans etc but which could instead mean that the less we see of it the better and it is worthless and is it incomparably worse that the morality of the spartans etc see qa note on page i there are diseases of the soul as well as of the body ii the diseases of the soul are vicious habits iii and just as bodily ailments are cured by medicines mental ailments are cured by philosophy iv so it seems that philosophy is a medicine for the soul of man v the way we judge concerning medicines deciding which ones to prefer is from the effects they bring about vi suppose that in the middle of an epidemic a new physician condemned the known established practice and recommended another method of cure and suppose that some people had plausible things to say in support of this proposal wouldnt you be inclined to let your attitude to it be governed by whatever difference it made to the mortality figures all you are doing is creating confusion and taking us away from our topic this reminds me of my friend lamprocles who needed only one argument against unbelievers i have noticed he told me that as unbelief grew so did corruption of every kind as well as new vices this simple observation of a matter of fact was enough to make him fill the minds of his children from an early age with the principles of religion despite the protests of many clever men the new theories that our clever moderns have tried to substitute for religion have run their full course in our times and have produced their effect on the minds and conduct of men that men are men is a sure maxim but its equally sure that englishmen are not the same men that they wereand you dont need me to tell you whether they are better or worse more or less virtuous than they used to be everyone can see and judge that for himself whatever the consequences may be i can never bring myself to agree with those who measure truth by convenience the only god i worship is truth wherever it leads i shall follow so you have a passion for truth undoubtedly for all truths for all to know them or to publish them both what would you busily correct the procedures of an enemy who was going about his attack in the wrong way would you help an enraged man to take out his sword in such cases common sense tells one how to behave so common sense should be consulted about whether a truth is salutary or hurtful fit to be declared or fit to be concealed how you would have me conceal and stifle the truth and keep it to myself is that what you aim at i only draw an obvious conclusion from things you say as for myself i dont believe that your opinions are true you do but if you are going to be consistent with yourself you shouldnt think it necessary or wise to publish hurtful truths just because they are true what service can it do mankind to lessen the motives to virtue and what harm can it do to increase them none in the world but i have to say that i cant square the accepted notions of god and providence with my understanding and i am just naturally revolted by the lowness of pretending not to notice a falsehood shall we therefore appeal to truth and examine the reasons that hold you back from believing in god and providence with all my heart but that is enough for just now lets make this the subject of our next conversation fourth dialogue thursday as i looked out of my window early the next morning i saw alciphron walking in the garden with all the signs of a man in deep thought i went down to him alciphron i said this early and profound meditation frightens me why because i would be sorry to be convinced that there is no god the thought of anarchy in nature is more shocking to me than the thought of anarchy in civil life because natural concerns are more important than civil ones and are the basis of all the others i grant replied alciphron that some inconvenience might follow from disproving the existence of god but as for what you say of fright and shocking all that is nothing but prejudice mere prejudice men form an idea or fanciful picture in their own minds and then bow down and worship it notions govern mankind but no other notion has taken such deep root or spread so widely as the notion of gods governing the world so its an heroic achievement by philosophy to unthrone this imaginary monarch and banish all those fears and spectres that only the light of reason can dispel it will be my role i said to stand by as i have done up to now taking notes of everything that happens during this memorable eventthe attempt of a less than sixfeettall minute philosopher to dethrone the monarch of the universe they kick this around a little and then are joined by euphranor and by crito who remarks that with alciphron having made such an early start we can expect to see atheism placed in the best light and supported by the strongest arguments then they get straight on with it not even finding somewhere to sit down the existence of a god is a subject on which countless commonplaces have been uttered theres no need for me to repeat them so allow me lay down certain rules and limitations so as to shorten this conversation the aim of debating is to persuade so anything that wont persuade should be left out of our debate here are three limitations on arguments against me i cant be persuaded by metaphysical arguments such as those from the idea of an allperfect being or from the absurdity of an infinite chain of causes i have always found arguments of this sort dry and thin and because they arent suited to my way of thinking they may puzzle me but theyll never convince me i cant be persuaded by the authority either of past ages or our present time the authority of mankind in general or of particular wise men none of that counts for much with a man who argues soundly and thinks freely arguments based on the utility or convenience of the belief in god are beside the point they may indeed prove the usefulness of the belief but not the existence of the thing the rigorous eyes of a philosopher can see that truth and convenience are very different things whatever legislators or statesmen may think so that i wont seem biased i also propose two limitations on arguments that i can use on my side i wont argue from anything that may seem irregular or unaccountable in the works of nature to the conclusion that nature is not caused by infinite power and wisdom i already know how you would answer such an argument if i did use it namely by saying that noone can judge the symmetry and use of the parts of an infinite machinewhose appropriateness and usefulness depends on how they relate to each other and to the wholewithout having a grasp of the entire machine the whole universe i undertake not to argue from premises about the harms that good men suffer and the prosperity that wicked men often enjoy in this life if i did argue in that way i know how you would reply instead of admitting this as a good argument against the existence of god you would make it an argument for an afterlife in which rewards and punishments will be distributed in ways that vindicate the divine attributes and set everything right at the end by not using those arguments i deprive you of an opportunity to give those answers but there is no unfairness in that even if the answers are good ones they arent arguments for the existence of god all they do is to solve certain difficulties that might be brought against the existence of god on the assumption that it had already been proved by proper argumentsi thought i should specify all this so as to save us all time and trouble what we should be aiming at here is the discovery and defence of truth and truth may be justified not only by persuading its adversaries but alsoif they cant be persuadedby showing them to be unreasonable so an argument that sheds light will have its effect even against an opponent who shuts his eyes because it will show him to be obstinate and prejudiced anyway minute philosophers are less attentive than anyone to this distinction between arguments that puzzle and arguments that convince so the distinction neednt be respected by others in their favour but euphranor may be willing to encounter you on your own terms in which case i have nothing more to say alciphron acts like a skillful general who works to get the advantage of the ground and entice the enemy to come out of their trenches we who believe in a god are entrenched in tradition custom authority and law but alciphron does not try to dislodge us instead he proposes that we should voluntarily abandon these entrenchments and attack him when we could easily and securely act on the defensive leaving him the trouble to dispossess us of what we need not resign the reasons that you have mustered up in your earlymorning meditation he continued addressing alciphron if they dont weaken our belief in a god must help to strengthen it for the utmost is to be expected from such a great a master in his profession when he really gets to work on something i regard the confused notion of a deity or supreme invisible power to be the most unconquerable of all prejudices when half a dozen able men get together over a glass of wine in a well lighted room we easily banish all the spectres of imagination or upbringing and are very clear about what we think and why but as i was taking a solitary walk before it was broad daylight this morning the issue seemed not quite so clear and i couldnt bring to mind the force of the arguments that have usually appeared so conclusive at other times i experienced a strange kind of awe and seemed haunted by a sort of panic which i cant account for except by supposing it to be the effect of prejudice you see i like the rest of the world was once a long time ago drilled and tutored into the belief in a god there is no surer mark of prejudice than believing something without any reason so what need is there for me to set myself the difficult task of proving a negative when it is sufficient for me to point out that there is no proof of the affirmative and that accepting it without proof is unreasonable so go ahead and prove your opinion if you cant you may indeed continue to have it but what you have will be merely a prejudice o alciphron if we are to content you we must prove it seems and we must do it on your terms well for a start let us see what sort of proof you expect the sort of proof i demand im not saying i expect it is the sort that every intelligent man requires for any matter of fact or for the existence of any particular thing other than himself why do i believe there is a king of great britain because i have seen him or a king of spain because i have seen people who saw him but as for this king of kingsi havent seen him myself nor have i seen anyone else who has seen him if there is such a thing as god surely its very strange that he has left himself without a witness that men should still be arguing about his existence and that there should be not a single evident sensible plain proof of his existence without having to bring in philosophy or metaphysics a matter of fact has to be proved not by notions but by facts you see what i am up to these are the principles on the basis of which i defy superstition so you believe as far as you can see that is my rule of faith what you wont believe in the existence of things that you hear unless you also see them no thats wrong when i insisted on seeing i meant to be talking about perceiving in general outward objects make very different impressions on the animal spirits impressions that are lumped together under the common label sense and whatever we can perceive by any sense we may be sure of a widely accepted theory going back at least as far as descartes held that the workings of animal bodies involve animal spirits envisaged as extremely fine and fluid matter that can get through holes that are too small to let even air pass through so you believe that there are such things as animal spirits doubtless what sense do you perceive them by i dont perceive them immediately by any of my senses but i am convinced of their existence because i can infer it from their effects and operations they are the messengers which running to and fro in the nerves enable outward objects to affect the soul so you admit the existence of a soul provided i dont admit an immaterial substance i see no drawback to allowing that there may be such a thing as a soul it may be no more than a thin fine texture of superfine parts or spirits residing in the brain im not asking about its nature i only ask whether you accept that there is a source of thought and action and whether it is perceivable by sense i grant that there is such a source and that it isnt itself an object of sense but we infer it from appearances that are perceived by sense see qa note on page i if i understand you rightly from animal functions and motions you infer the existence of animal spirits and from reasonable acts you infer the existence of a reasonable soul ii so it seems that the existence of things that cant be perceived through the senses can be inferred from sensible effects and signs iii the soul is what makes the principal distinction between a real person and a shadow between a living man and a carcass iv so i cant know that you for instance are a distinct thinking individual a living real man except by inferring from certain signs that you have a soul v all acts that are immediately and properly perceived by sense come down to motion vi so from motions you infer a mover or cause and from reasonable motions or such as appear calculated for a reasonable end you infer a rational cause soul or spirit vii now the soul of man drives only a small body an insignificant particle by comparison with the great masses of nature the elements the heavenly bodies the system of the world and the wisdom that appears in the motions that are the effect of human reason is incomparably less than the wisdom that reveals itself in the structure and use of organized natural bodies animal or plant a man cant make with his hand a machine as admirable as the hand itself and none of the motions by which we trace out human reason come anywhere near to the skill and ingenuity of the wonderful motions of the heart brain and other vital parts that dont depend on the will of man viii so it follows that from natural motions that are independent of mans will we can infer both power and wisdom incomparably greater than that of the human soul ix furthermore in natural productions and effects there is a visible unity of plan and design the rules of nature are fixed and immovable the same laws of motion apply throughout the same in china and here the same two thousand years ago and today x and from the mutual respects influences subordinations and uses involved in the way animals relate to plants animals and plants relate to the elements and elements relate to heavenly bodies we can infer that they are all parts of one whole all working towards the same end and fulfilling the same design supposing all this to be true wont it then follow that this vastly great perhaps infinitepower and wisdom must be supposed to be in one single agent spirit or mind and that our certainty of the existence of this infinitely wise and powerful spirit is at least as clear full and immediate as our certainty of the existence of any one human soul apart from our own let me think i suspect we proceed too hastily remember that in the original qa version alciphron gave a consecutive series of nine positive answersit is it may i grant it is and so on what do you claim that you can have the same assurance of the existence of a god that you can have of my existence when you actually see me stand in front of you and talk to you the very same assurance if not a greater how do you support that the phrase the person alciphron means an individual thinking thing not the hair skin or visible surface or any part of the outward form colour or shape of alciphron this i grant in granting that you grant that strictly speaking i dont see alciphron ie that individual thinking thing but only visible signs and tokens that suggest and imply the existence of that invisible source of thought or soul in exactly the same way it seems to me that though i cant with my physical eyes see the invisible god i do in the strictest sense see and perceive by all my senses the signs and tokens effects and operations that suggest and indicate and demonstrate the existence of an invisible god doing this as certainly and making it at least as evident as any signs suggesting to me the existence of your soul spirit or thinking principle i am convinced that your soul exists by a few signs or effects and the movements of one small organic body whereas i am always and everywhere perceiving sensible signs that point to the existence of god so the thesis that you doubted or denied at the outset now seems obviously to follow from the premises throughout this whole inquiry havent we carefully thought about every step we took not moving to accept any proposition that wasnt clearly evident you and i examined and assented to each foregoing proposition one by one so what should we do with the conclusion speaking for myself if you dont come to my rescue i shall absolutely have to accept the conclusion as true so if i live and die as a believer in god youll have to take the blame i have to admit that i dont readily find an answer there seems to be some foundation for what you say but if this matter is as clear as you claim it is i cannot conceive how so many able men of our sect of freethinkers should be so much in the dark that they dont know or believe one syllable of it alciphron its not our present business to explain the oversights or vindicate the honour of those great men the freethinkers when their very existence is in danger of being called in question how so remember your concessions and then show me if the arguments for a god are not conclusive what better argument you have to prove the existence of the thinking thing which in strictness constitutes the freethinker alciphron stopped in his tracks and stood in a posture of meditation while the rest of us continued our walk after a little while he rejoined us with a smiling face like someone who had made some discovery i have found he said something that may clear up the point in dispute and completely answer euphranors challenge i mean an argument that will prove the existence of a freethinker but cant be adapted to prove the existence of a god this idea of yours that we perceive the existence of god as certainly and immediately as we do that of a human person was more than i could swallow though i have to admit that it puzzled me until i had thought it through at first i thought that a particular structure shape or motion might be the most certain proof of a thinking reasonable soul but a little attention satisfied me that these things have no necessary connection with reason knowledge and wisdom perhaps they are certain proofs of a living soul but they cant be certain proofs of a thinking and reasonable one on second thoughts and after a minute examination of this point i have found that nothing so much convinces me of the existence of another person as his speaking to me its hearing you talk that is the best strict and philosophical argument i have for your existence and this is a restricted argument that cant be adapted to your purpose for you wont claim that god speaks to man in the same clear and audible way as one man speaks to anotherwill you what is the impression of sound so much more evident than that of other senses and if it is is the voice of man louder than that of thunder you are missing the point what im talking about is not the sheer sound of speech but language we have perceptible signs that dont resembleand arent necessarily connected withthe things they signify the way we use them is arbitrary in the sense of being chosen by us rather than laid down in the nature of things and what we use them for is to suggest and exhibit to the minds of others an endless variety of things that differ in nature time and place thereby giving one another information entertainment and direction for how to act with regard to near and present things and also distant and future things whether these signs are pronounced and heard or written and seen they have the same use and are equally proofs of an intelligent thinking designing cause but what if it should appear that god really speaks to man would this content you i dont accept stories about inward speech holy instincts or indications of light or spirit men of good sense regard all that as nothing to achieve something on this topic youll need to make it plain to me that god speaks to men by outward perceptible signs of the same kind and in the same way as i have defined well if i show it to be plainly the case that god speaks to men through arbitrary outward perceptible signs that dont resembleand arent necessarily connected withthe things they stand for and suggest and that by countless combinations of these signs an endless variety of things is revealed and made known to us and that through this we are instructed or informed about the different natures of things are taught and warned about what to avoid and what to pursue and are told how to regulate our movements and how to act with respect to things that are far off in space or in the futurewill this satisfy you its just the thing im challenging you to prove for it incorporates the force and use and nature of language see qa note on page i look alciphron you can see a castle on that hill over there ii it is a long way away iii a things distance from oneself is a line turned endwise to the eye iv and a line in that situation cant project more than one single point on the bottom of the eye v so the appearance of a long distance has the same size as the appearance of a short one or rather neither of them has any size at all because always what you have at the eye is a single point vi it follows from this that distance is not immediately perceived by the eye vii so it must be perceived by the mediation of some other thing viii to discover what this mediatorthis intermediate itemis let us examine how the appearance of an object changes as it is placed at different distances from the eye i find by experience that as an object is moved further and further away from me its visible appearance becomes lesser and fainter and this change of appearance seems to be what we go by in taking in differences of distance ix but littleness or faintness dont seem in themselves to be necessarily connected with greater distance x so its only because of our experience that littleness and faintness suggest or are signs of distance x that is to say we dont perceive distance immediately we perceive it through the mediation of a sign that doesnt resemble it and isnt necessarily connected with it but only suggests it on the basis of repeated experience as words suggest things wait a bit euphranor ive just remembered that writers on optics tell us of an angle that the two optic axes make where they meet at the object being looked at the more obtuse this angle is the nearer it shows the object to be and the more acute the angle the further away the object is and this holds not as something arbitrary that we learn by experience but as a necessary connection that can be demonstrated so the mind discovers how far away things are by geometry it does wouldnt it follow then that the only people who could see are those who have learned geometry and know something of lines and angles theres a sort of natural geometry that is acquired without learning but alciphron in order to construct a proof of any kind or deduce a conclusion from premises dont i have to perceive how the terms are connected with one another in the premises and how the premises are connected with the conclusion more generally if i am to know one thing x by means of another thing y dont i first have to know y when i perceive your meaning by your words dont i have first to perceive the words themselves and in any inference dont i have to know the premises before i infer the conclusion all this is true thus whoever infers a nearer distance from a wider angle or a further distance from an acuter angle must first perceive the angles themselves someone who doesnt perceive those angles cant infer anything from them can he it is as you say now ask the first man you meet whether he perceives or knows anything of those optic angles or whether he ever thinks about them or infers anything from them whether by natural or by artificial geometry how would you expect him to answer candidly i think he would answer that he knew nothing of those matters so it cant be true that men judge distance by angles and that removes all the force from your argument to prove that distance is perceived by means of something that has a necessary connection with it i agree with you it seems to me that a man can know whether or not he perceives a thing and if he does perceive it he can know whether he does this immediately or mediately and if he perceives it mediately he can know whether he is doing this by means of something like or unlike the thing necessarily or arbitrarily connected with it it seems so and isnt it certain that if distance is not perceived immediately just by itself or by means of any image that resembles it or by means of any lines and angles that have a necessary connection with it it is perceived only by means of experience it is from the things i have said and you have agreed to doesnt it seem to follow that before a man had any experience he wouldnt imagine that the things he saw were at any distance from him what show me the smallness or faintness of appearance or any other idea or sensation that doesnt resemble distance and isnt necessarily connected with it cant suggest differences of distancecant suggest anything about distanceto a mind that hasnt experienced a connection between those things and distance any more than words can suggest notions to a man before he has learned the language i agree that thats true then doesnt it follow that a man who was born blind and was then enabled to see would when he first gained his sight take the things he saw to be not at any distance from him but rather in his eye or in his mind i have to admit that this seems right and yet i find it hard to believe that if i were in such a state i would think that the objects i now see at such a great a distance were at no distance at all so you do now think that the objects of sight are at a distance from you certainly i do can anyone question that that castle over there is at a great distance tell me alciphron can you pick out the doors windows and battlements of that same castle i cant at this distance it seems only a small round tower but i have visited the castle and i know that its not a small round tower but a large square building with battlements and turrets that you evidently dont see what do you infer from that i infer that the object that you strictly and properly perceive by sight is not the very same thing as the one that is several miles distant why so because a little round object is one thing and a great square object is another isnt that right i cant deny it tell me isnt the proper object of sightthe thing that we actually strictly immediately seethe visible appearance it is what do you now think about the visible appearance of the moon up there isnt it a round shining flat thing no bigger than a sixpence what if it is well tell me what you think about the moon itself dont you think of it as a vast opaque globe with many hills and valleys i do then how can you think that the proper object of your sight exists at a distance i admit that i dont know to convince you even more consider that crimson cloud in the east do you think that if you were in it you would perceive anything like what you now see by no means all i would see is a dark mist isnt it clear then that the castle the moon and the cloud that you see here are not the real castle moon and cloud that you suppose exist at a distance what am i to think then do we see anything at all or is the visual side of our lives nothing but fancy and illusion here is the bottom line as i understand it the proper objects of sight are light and colours with their many hues and degrees of saturation and of brightness these can be varied and put together in countless different ways forming a language that is wonderfully adapted to indicate and exhibit to us the distances shapes locations sizes and various qualities of tangible objects ones we can perceive through our sense of touch the objects of sight dont resemble the tangible things nor are they necessarily connected with them the association of sight with touch is due to gods choosing it its like the association between words and the things signified by them what dont we strictly speaking perceive by sight such things as trees houses men rivers and so on we do indeed perceive or apprehend those things by the faculty of sight but it doesnt follow from this they are the proper and immediate objects of sight any more than that all the things that are signified by the help of spoken words or sounds are the proper and immediate objects of hearing so you want us to think that light shades and colours variously combined correspond to the many articulations of sound in language and that by means of them all sorts of objects are suggested to the mind through the eye in the same way that they are suggested by words or sounds through the earie not through logical inference by the faculty of judgment and not through similarities that are picked up by the imagination but purely and solely from experience custom and habit i dont want you to think anything more than the nature of things obliges you to think i dont want you to submit in the least to my judgment but only to the force of truth and i doubt if even the freest thinkers will claim to be exempt from that constraint you have led me step by step to a place where i am lost but ill try to get out again if not by the way i came then by some other that i find for myself short pause then tell me euphranor wouldnt it follow from these principles that a man who had been born blind and was then enabled to see would at first sight not only not perceive how far away men and trees etc were from him but also not perceive that they were men and trees surely this is absurd i agree that the principles we have both accepted do imply that such a man would never think of men trees or any other objects that he had been accustomed to perceive only by touch at the stage of his development that we are talking about his mind would be filled with new sensations of light and colours whose various combinations he wouldnt yet understand or know the meaning of any more than a chinese person on first hearing the words man and tree would think of men and trees in each case there has to be time and experience in which repeated events would enable him to acquire a habit of knowing how the signs are connected with the things that are signified ie to enable him to understand the language whether the language of the eyes or the language of the ears i see nothing absurd in all this the phrase the language of the eyes refers not to human language as written down but to gods language in which the visual appearances of things inform us about their distances and their tactual qualities in strict philosophical truth therefore i see that rock only in the sense in which i hear that rock when i hear the word rock being uttered in the very same sense then why is it that everyone will say that he sees a rock or a house when those things are before his eyes whereas nobody will say that he hears a rock or a house when he hears and understands the words rock or house and a second point if vision is only a language speaking to the eyes when did men learn this language its a pretty difficult task to learn the meanings of all the signs that make up a language but noone will say that he has devoted time and trouble to learning this language of vision thats not surprising if we have been all practising this language ever since our first entrance into the world if god constantly speaks to the eyes of all mankind even in their earliest infancy whenever their eyes are open in the light it doesnt seem to me at all strange that men arent aware they ever learned a language that they began on so early and practised so constantly as this language of vision remember also that it is the same language throughout the whole world and not differing in different places as other languages do so we can understand how men might mistake the connection between the proper objects of sight and the things they signify for some kind of similarity or necessary relation and even how they might take them to be the same things euphranor then points out that our conscious minds tend overlook things that we are in fact steering by when they are extremely familiar for example youve been reading this page without consciously attending to the individual letters of which the words are made up alciphron grumbles that euphranors points are too dry and tedious for a gentlemans attention crito snaps back at him alciphron replies trying to lower the temperature and then to cut short this squabbling resumes the discussion i put it fairly to your own conscience do you really think that god himself speaks every day and in every place to the eyes of all men that is really and truly what i think and you should think it too if you are consistent with yourself and stand by your own definition of language you cant deny that the great mover and author of nature constantly explains himself to the eyes of men by means of perceptible arbitrary signs that have no resemblance or necessary connection with the things signified so that by compounding and arranging them to suggest and exhibit an endless variety of objects of different kinds in different times and places thereby informing and directing men how to act with respect to distant and future things as well as near and present ones the compounding and arranging part of this is offered as analogous to constructing sentences out of words there will soon be a good deal more about this these are your views as well as mine and their consequence is that you have as much reason to think god speaks to your eyes as you can have for thinking that any given person speaks to your ears i cant help thinking that some fallacy runs throughout this whole line of argument though i cant easily put a finger on it it seems to me that every other sense has as good a claim as vision to be called a language smells and tastes for example are signs that inform us of other qualities to which they have neither resemblance nor necessary connection certainly they are signs there is a general concept of sign that covers the parts of language as well as all those other signs but equally certainly not all signs are languagenot even all significant sounds such as the natural cries of animals or the inarticulate sounds and interjections of men the true nature of language consists in the articulation combination variety copiousness extensive and general use and easy application of signsand all of these are commonly found in vision as well as in languages more conventionally socalled other senses may indeed provide signs but those signs have no more right to be thought to be a language than inarticulate sounds such as a pained grunt or a surprised whistle wait let me see in language the signs are arbitrary arent they they are and consequently they dont always suggest real matters of fact because people sometimes say things that are false whereas this natural language of vision as you call it or these visible signs do always suggest things in the same uniform way and have the same constant regular connection with matters of fact which seems to imply that their connection with what they signify is necessary which would mean they werent a language after all according to the definition of language that we have been working with how do you solve this objection you can solve it yourself with the help of a picture or a mirror youre right i see there is nothing in it when i look at a certain picture i receive a visual statement that theres a yellow tiger on that wall and there isnt when i look in a mirror i receive a visual statement that theres a bearded old man staring at me and there isnt this simple point really does counter alciphrons view that visual statements are necessarily connected with tangible realities i dont know what else to say about this view of yours other than that its so odd and contrary to my way of thinking that ill never assent to it remember please your own lectures about prejudice and apply them in the present case maybe they will help you to follow where reason leads and to be suspicious of notions that are strongly riveted without ever having been examined i indignantly reject the suspicion of prejudice im not speaking only for myself i know a club of extremely able men the freest from prejudice of any men alive who hate the notion of a god and im sure would be very able to untie this knot dion our narrator speaks up here remarking that alciphrons reliance on others is unworthy of him and of his principles as well as being a dangerous tactic crito then weighs in with scornful colourful offensive remarks about how freethinkers insincerely vary their standards of intellectual conduct according to what company they are in a nasty quarrel is in the making but alciphron calls a halt to this irksome and needless discourse he continues for my part i am a friend to inquiry i am willing that reason should have its full and free scope i build on no mans authority for my part denying a god doesnt serve my selfinterest in any way any man may believe or not believe a god as he pleases still euphranor must allow me to stare a little at his conclusions the conclusions are yours as much as mine for you were led to them by your own concessions you it seems stare to find that god is not far from every one of us and that in him we live and move and have our being acts first thing this morning you thought it strange that god should leave himself without a witness do you now think it strange that the witness should be so full and clear i must say i do i was aware of a certain metaphysical hypothesis to the effect that we see all things in god by the union of the human soul with the intelligible substance of the deity which neither i nor anyone else could make sense of this refers to a thesis of malebranches for sober hardthoughtout reasons he held that any ideas that come before our minds are literally godsnot ideas that he causes in us but ideas that he has himself in his mind the phrase intelligible substance of the deity is typical malebranchespeak but i never dreamed that anyone would claim that we see god with our own physical eyes as plainly as we see any human person whatsoever and that he daily speaks to our senses in a plain and clear dialect as for that metaphysical hypothesis i can make no more of it than you can but i think its clear that this optical language that euphranor has been describing has a necessary connection with knowledge wisdom and goodness it is equivalent to a constant creation indicating an immediate act of power and providence it cant be accounted for on mechanical principles by atoms or attractions or emanations of gases heres what we have the instantaneous production and reproduction of ever so many signscombined dissolved transposed diversified and adapted to an endless variety of purposesconstantly shifting in ways that are suitable to the circumstances incapable of being explained by the laws of motion chance fate or any other such blind source of energy this presents and testifies to the immediate operation of a spirit or thinking beinga wise good and provident spirit who directs and rules and governs the world some philosophers being convinced of the wisdom and power of the creator from the structure and workings of organic bodies and the orderly system of the world nevertheless thought that god left this system with all its parts and contents well adjusted and set in motion as an artisan leaves a clock to run on its own for a certain period but this visual language proves that there is not merely a creator but a caring governor who is actually and intimately present to us attentive to all our interests and to all our movements watching our conduct and attending to our minutest actions and designs throughout the whole course of our livesinforming scolding and directing us incessantly in a most evident and perceptible manner this is truly wonderful and isnt it amazing that men should be surrounded by such a wonder without reflecting on it theres something divine and admirable in this language addressed to our eyes something that may well awaken the mind and deserve its utmost attention it is learned with so little trouble it expresses the differences of things so clearly and aptly it instructs so quickly and clearly conveying by one glance a greater variety of bits of advice and a clearer knowledge of things than could be had from several hours of talk and along with informing it also amuses and entertains the mind with such unique pleasure and delight it is of excellent use in giving stability and permanence to human discourse in recording sounds and bestowing life on dead languages enabling us to write and read and thus to converse with men of remote ages and countries and it answers so precisely to our purposes and needs informing us more clearly about objects whose nearness and size make them likely to do the most harm or good to our bodies and less exactly in proportion as their smallness or distance from us makes them of less concern to us and yet men arent much impressed by these strange things but they arent strange theyre familiar and thats why they are overlooked things that rarely happen make an impression when they do whereas frequency lessens our admiration for things that may in themselves be ever so admirable so an ordinary person who isnt much given to thinking and meditating would probably be more convinced of the existence of a god by one single sentence heard once in his life coming down from the sky than by all the experience he has had of this visual language contrived with such exquisite skill so constantly addressed to his eyes and so plainly declaring the nearness wisdom and providence of the person who is addressing us but i still cant help wondering how men should be so little surprised or amazed by this visual faculty if it really is of such a surprising and amazing nature lets suppose a nation of men blind from birth among whom a stranger arrives the only sighted man in all the country lets suppose that this stranger travels with some of the natives and that he foretells that if they walk straight forward in half an hour theyll meet men or cattle or come to a house that if they make a right turn and then keep walking they will in a few minutes be in danger of falling down a precipice that by walking to the left they will in suchandsuch a time arrive at a river a wood or a mountain what do you think wouldnt they be infinitely surprised that someone who had never been in their country before knew it so much better than themselves and wouldnt those predictions seem to them as inexplicable and incredible as prophecy would to a minute philosopher i cant deny it but it seems to require intense thought to be able to sort out a prejudice that has been so long forming to get over the vulgar error of thinking there are ideas that are common to both senses and thus to be able to distinguish the objects of sight from those of touch these two kinds of objects haveif i may put it this wayblended together so intimately in our imagination that its extremely difficult for us to think ourselves into the precise state one of those men would be in if he were enabled to see but i believe it can be done and it might seem worth the trouble of a little thinking especially to men who are specially and intensively engaged in thinking unravelling prejudices and exposing mistakes i admit frankly that i cant find my way out of this mazeie i cant think myself into the frame of mind of the bornblind man who just begins to seeand i would be glad to be guided out of it by those who see better than i do crito quotes a biblical passage he is reminded of then a servant announces that tea is ready they go inside for it and find lysicles already there i am glad to have found my second said alciphron a fresh man to maintain our common cause which im sure lysicles will think has suffered through his absence why so i have been drawn into some concessions you wont like let me know what they are well that there is such a thing as a god and that his existence is very certain bless me how did you come to entertain such a wild idea well you know we claim to follow reason wherever it leads in brief i have been reasoned into it reasoned you should say baffled with words bewildered by sophistry would you like to hear the reasoning that led alciphron and me step by step so that we can examine whether or not it is sophistry im easy about that i can guess everything that can be said on that topic it will be my business to help my friend out whatever arguments drew him in will you admit the premises and deny the conclusions what if i admit the conclusion what will you grant that there is a god perhaps i may then we are agreed perhaps not o lysicles you are a subtle adversary i dont know what you are up to well the existence of god is basically an affair of little importance and a man may make this concession without yielding much what really matters is what sense the word god is to be given even the epicureans allowed that there are gods but then they were idle gods with no concern about human affairs hobbes allowed a corporeal god and spinoza held that the universe is god yet nobody doubts that these men were staunch freethinkers i could wish indeed that the word god were entirely dropped because in most minds it is coupled with a sort of superstitious awe the very root of all religion still i dont much mind if the name god is retained and the existence of god acceptedin any sense except that of a mind that knows everything and surveys human actionslike some judge or magistratewith infinite care and intelligence the belief in god in this sense fills a mans mind with worries puts him under constraints and embitters his very being but the belief in god in another sense can be free of anything much in the way of bad consequences i know this was the opinion of our great diagoras who told me he would never have taken the trouble to discover a demonstration that there is no god if the generally accepted notion of god had been the one that some of the church fathers and scholastics had and what was that well diagoras had discovered that once upon a time the deepest and most theoretically serious theologians found that they couldnt reconcile the attributes of god when taken in the ordinary sense or in any known sense with human reason and how the world shows itself to be so they adopted the doctrine that the words knowledge wisdom goodness and so on when applied to god must be understood in a quite different sense from what they mean in ordinary language and from anything that we can form a notion of or conceive this let them easily answer any objections that might be made against the attributes of god all they had to do was to deny that those attributes belonged to god in this or that or any known particular sense which amounted to denying that they belonged to him at all and by denying the attributes of god they in effect denied his existence though they may not have been aware of that heres an example suppose a man were to object that future contingencies are inconsistent with gods foreknowledge because certain knowledge of something that is uncertain is selfcontradictory the theologians i am talking about had an easy answer to ready at hand namely what you say may be true with respect to knowledge taken in the ordinary sense or in any sense that we can possibly form any notion of but theres no inconsistency between the contingent nature of things and divine foreknowledge taken to signify something of which we know nothingsomething that serves god in the way that what we understand by knowledge serves us the difference between these two is not one of quantity or degree of perfection they differ altogether totally in kind as light differs from sound actually they differ even more than that because light and sound are both sensations whereas knowledge in god has no sort of resemblance or agreement with any notion that man can form of knowledge the same can be said of all the other attributes which in this way can be equally reconciled with everything or with nothing any thinking person must see this is cutting knots rather than untying them for something cant be reconciled with the divine attributes when these attributes themselves are denied of god in every intelligible sense so that the very notion of god is taken away and nothing is left but the name without any meaning attached to it in short the belief that there is an unknown subject of attributes that are absolutely unknown is a very innocent doctrine which is why the acute diagoras who saw this was perfectly delighted with this system if this could once make its way and be accepted in the world diagoras said that would put an end to all natural or rational religion which is the basis of both the jewish and the christian religions for someone who comes to god or goes into the church of god must first believe that there is a god in some intelligible sense not merely that there is something in general without any proper notioneven a very inadequate oneof any of its qualities or attributes for this something in general could be fate or chaos or creative nature or anything else as well as it could be god and its no help to say there is something in this unknown being that is analogous to knowledge and goodness ie something that produces the effects that we cant conceive to be produced by men without knowledge and goodness for this is still to surrender to the atheist side against the theists the dispute has never been over whether there is a principle roughly something absolutely basic or primal a first cause because all philosophers right back to the presocratics have agreed that there is what they havent agreed about is whether these are true or false this principle is a thinking intelligent being the order beauty and usefulness that we see in natural effects couldnt be produced by anything but a mind or intelligence properly socalled the first cause must have had true real proper knowledge so we on the atheist side who think that all three are false will accept that all the natural effects that are vulgarly ascribed to knowledge and wisdom come from a being in which there is no knowledge or wisdom properly socalled at all but only something else that causes the things that men in their ignorance ascribe to what they call knowledge and wisdom and understanding you may be surprised to hear a man of pleasure like me philosophizing in this context but theres a lot to be gained from conversation with able men its a shortcut to knowledge and saves one from the drudgery of reading and thinking so now we have granted to you that there is a god in this indefinite sensewhat use can you make of this concession you cant argue from unknown attributes you cant prove that god should be loved for his goodness feared for his justice or respected for his knowledge we agree that all those consequences would follow from gods having goodness and the rest with those names taken in intelligible senses but we deny that any consequences follow from attributes admitted in no particular sense or in a sense that none of us understand thus since from such an account of god nothing can be inferred about conscience or worship or religion you are welcome to the account and so as not to stand out from the crowd well use the name god too and so snap theres an end of atheism this account of a deity is new to me i dont like it so ill leave it to be maintained by those who do its not new to me a while ago i heard a minute philosopher triumph on this very point and that set me to inquiring what basis there is for it in the church fathers or the scholastics crito now embarks on a long and learned lecture starting with the early history of this idea that knowledge etc are not to be applied to god in the same sense as they are to men just how early its start was is not clear because issues arise about the true authorship of various works it is clear that the thesis wasnt meant in the flatteningout way in which lysicles has understood it but rather than going into all those details we can safely jump ahead to this thomas aquinas expresses his sense of this matter as follows all perfections that created things get from god are also perfections of god in a certain higher sense which the scholastics express by saying that those perfections are in god eminently so whenever we attribute to god a perfection to which we give a name borrowed from that perfection in created things we must exclude from the names meaning everything that belongs to the imperfect way in which that attribute is found in created things from this he infers that knowledge in god is not a habit or disposition but a pure act and although suarez joins other scholastics in teaching that the mind of man conceives knowledge and will to be faculties or operations of god only by analogy to created things yet he plainly declares this not a quotation from him when it is said that knowledge is not properly in god this must be understood to be referring to knowledge including imperfection eg conceptual knowledge or some other imperfect kind of knowledge that created beings have none of those imperfections in the knowledge of men or angels is a feature of knowledge as such there can be knowledge that doesnt have them so from the premise that god doesnt have such imperfectionincluding knowledge it doesnt follow that knowledge in the proper sense of knowledge cant be attributed to god and of knowledge taken in a general way for the clear evident understanding of all truth he expressly affirms that this is in god and that this was never denied by any philosopher who believed in a god at that time the scholastics generally held that even being should be attributed to god and to created things only analogically that is they held that godthe supreme independent selfcausing cause and source of all beingsmustnt be supposed to exist in the same sense of exist as that in which created beings exist not that he exists less truly or properly than they do but only that he exists in a more eminent and perfect manner i wouldnt want anyone to be led through a misunderstanding of scholastics use of the terms analogy and analogical to the view that we cant get any distance towards forming a true and proper notion of attributes that we apply to god by analogy so let us look into the true sense and meaning of those words everyone knows that analogy is a greek word used by mathematicians to signify a likeness of proportions for example when we observe that two is to six as three is to nine this equality of proportion is called analogy and although the word proportion strictly signifies only the relation of one quantity to another in a looser derived sense it has been applied to signify every other kind of relational property and the term analogy has been broadened along with proportion so that now it signifies likeness or equality in respect of all relations or relational properties whatsoever and so we find the scholastics telling us there is an analogy between intellect and sight because intellect is to the mind what sight is to the body and that he who governs the state is analogous to him who steers a ship so that a monarch is analogically called a pilot being to the state what a pilot is to his vessel theres something else that may help to clear this matter up namely the scholastics distinction between two kinds of analogy metaphorical and proper the bible has plenty of examples of metaphorical analogy attributing human parts and passions to god when he is represented as having a finger an eye or an ear when he is said to repent to be angry or grieved everyone sees that the analogy is merely metaphorical such things as parts and passions properly understood essentially involve some imperfection so when it is said the finger of god appears in some event men of common sense mean only that the event in question is as truly ascribed to god as the works wrought by human fingers are ascribed to man and similarly with the rest the phrase the rest is berkeleys if it is meant to cover anger and grief as well as eyes and ears crito doesnt explain how but the case is different when wisdom and knowledge are attributed to god passions and senses as such involve defects but theres no defect in knowledge as such so it is all right to attribute knowledge to god therefore in the proper formal meaning of the word knowledge as long as it is attributed in a way that is proportional to gods infinite nature so we can say that just as god is infinitely above man so his knowledge is infinitely above mans thus this doctrine of analogical perfections in god or our knowing god by analogy seems to be misunderstood by those who infer from it that we cant form any direct or proper notion however inadequate of knowledge or wisdom as these occur in god and now gentlemen you may think i should ask your pardon for having dwelt so long its twice as long in the original on a point of metaphysics and introduced into good company such unpolished and unfashionable writers as the scholastics but lysicles gave me the opening so i leave him to answer for it i never dreamed of this dry lecture if i have opened up the discussion to these scholarly matters by my unfortunate mention of the scholastics it was my first fault of that kind and i promise it will be my last i dont enjoy involvement with crabbed authors of any sort its true that occasionally one finds a good idea in what we call dry writers an example was the idea i was speaking of which i must admit struck my fancy but for writers such as these we have the likes of prodicus and diagoras who read obsolete books and save the rest of us that trouble so you pin your faith on them only for some odd opinions and matters of fact and critical points but i could safely rely on them for more than that we know the men in whom we put our trust they are judicious and honest and have no aim except to get to the truth and im sure that some author or other has maintained the view i presented in the same sense as diagoras reported it that may be but it never was a generally accepted view and it never will be so long as men believe in a god that is because the same arguments that there was a first cause also prove that the first cause was intelligent using intelligent in its proper sense and also wise and good using those words too in their true and formal meanings but for your part alciphron you have been fully convinced that god is a thinking intelligent being in the same sense as other spirits though not in the same imperfect manner or degree well i do have some worries about that with knowledge you infer perhaps imply wisdom and with wisdom you infer goodness and i cant see that it is either wise or good to enact laws that cant ever be obeyed does anyone find fault with the exactness of geometrical rules because noone in practice can achieve it the perfection of a rule is useful even if it isnt reached many can approach something that noone actually reaches but how is it possible to conceive of god as so good when man is so wicked there is some plausibility perhaps to the idea that a little soft shadowing of evil sets off the bright and luminous parts of the creation and so contributes to the beauty of the whole piece here painting but you cant account in that way for such large black blots as those the world has that there should be so much vice and so little virtue on earth and that the laws of gods kingdom should be so poorly observed by his subjectsthats what cant be reconciled with the surpassing wisdom and goodness of the supreme monarch tell me alciphron would you argue that a state was ill administered or judge the manners of its citizens on the evidence of the disorders committed in the gaol or dungeon i would not well for all we know this spot with its few sinners may be as small a proportion of the universe of thinking beings as a dungeon is of a kingdom we seem to get our views not only from revelation but also from ordinary plain senseperception which leads us to infer by analogy with the world as we see it that there are innumerable orders of intelligent beings happier and more perfect than man our life is very short and this earthly globe where we live is a mere point in comparison with the whole system of gods creation we are indeed dazzled by the glory and grandeur of some things here below because we know no better but im inclined to believe that if we knew what it was to be an angel for one hour we would return to this worldeven to sit on the brightest throne in itwith vastly more loathing and reluctance than we would now descend into a loathsome dungeon or sepulchre to me it seems natural that such a weak passionate and shortsighted creature as man is always liable to worries of one kind or other but as hethis very same creatureis also apt to be overpositive in judging and overhasty in drawing conclusions these difficulties and doubts about gods conduct are turned into objections to his existence and so men end up arguing from their own defects against the divine perfections and although the views and temperaments of men are different and often opposite you can sometimes see them deduce the same atheistic conclusion from contrary premises two minute philosophers whom i know used to argue each from his own temperament against a providence caring god one of them a badtempered and vindictive man said that he couldnt believe in providence because london had not been swallowed up or consumed by fire from heaven the reason he gave was that the streets are full of people who show no belief in god or worship of him except perpetually praying that he would damn rot sink and confound them that sentence from perpetually to the end is as berkeley wrote it the original like this version seems to speak of people calling down gods wrath on themselves the other an idle goodtempered fellow concluded that there cant be such a thing as providence because an utterly wise being would have to have better things to do than attending to the prayers and actions and little interests of mankind after all if god has no passions how can it be true that vengeance is his or how can he be said to be jealous of his glory for i the lord thy god am a jealous god exodus in this context jealous of his glory means resentful of anything that denies or belittles his glory we believe that god executes vengeance without revenge and is jealous without weakness just as the mind of man sees without eyes and grasps without hands as when we say i see the flaw in your argument and i grasp the situation its time to end this part of the discussion so well grant that there is a god in this dispassionate sensebut then what of it what does this have to do with religion or divine worship what is the point of all these prayers and praises and thanksgivings and psalmsinging that the foolish vulgar call serving god what sense is there in all these things what use are they what are they for we worship god we praise and pray to him not because we think that he is proud of our worship or fond of our praise or prayers and affected by them as mankind are or because we think that our service can contribute in some measure to his happiness or good but because it is good for us to be disposed to relate in that way to god because our worship is just and right suitable to the nature of things and fitting to the way we relate to our supreme lord and governor if it is good for us to worship god it would seem that the christian religion which claims to teach men the knowledge and worship of god is of some use and benefit to mankind doubtless unless i am very much mistaken you wont be able to show that that is right it is now nearly dinnertime lets stop our conversation for now and pick it up again tomorrow morning fifth dialogue saturday dion reports that on the next morning friday the group walked to a charming spot in the countryside and were settling down for an allday conversation when they were interrupted by a clamour including the barking of hounds and the roaring of country squires it was a foxhunt in which one of the hunters had fallen from his horse and broken a rib the day was spent in getting him to critos home and caring for him there sending for a surgeon feeding the foxhunters who with loud rustic mirth gave proof of their religion and loyalty by the healths they drank and so on the following morning the discussiongroup returned to the place where they had been when the hunt and accident interrupted them now lysicles being a fastidiously elegant man and a witty one was utterly contemptuous of the rough manners and conversation of the foxhunters and was angry that he had lost so many hours in their company i cheered myself up he said by the thought that there were no longer any of this species among us meaning presumably moving in the social circles in which i move its strange that men should be entertained by such uncouth noise and hurry or find pleasure in the society of dogs and horses how much more elegant the diversions of the town are foxhunters replied euphranor in a certain way resemble freethinkers the foxhunters employ their animal faculties in pursuit of game and you gentlemen employ your intellectual faculties in the pursuit of truth its the same sort of pastime though the objects are different i would rather be compared to any brute on earth than a rational brute in this context rational is code for human lysicles is saying that he would rather be compared to subhuman animal than to a brutish human being such as a foxhunter that means that youd have been less displeased with my friend pythocles whom i have heard compare the common sort of minute philosophers not to the hunters but to the hounds he gave this reason youll often see among the dogs a loud babbler with a bad nose lead the unskilful part of the pack who all rush after him without following any scent of their own any more than the herd of freethinkers follow their own reason but pythocles was a blunt man and he cant ever have encountered such reasoners among the freethinkers as you gentlemen who can sit so long at an argument dispute every inch of ground and yet know when to make a reasonable concession i dont know how it happened but it seems that alciphron has been making concessions for me as well as for himself speaking for myself im not quite so ready to concede things but i dont want to be a standout either truly alciphron when i consider how far we have come and how far we are agreed i think its likely that well eventually come to be in complete agreement you have granted that a life of virtue is to be preferred as the kind of life most conducive both to the general good of mankind and to the good of individuals and you allow that the beauty of virtue isnt by itself a strong enough motive to get mankind to live virtuously this led you to agree that the belief in a god would be very useful in the world and that therefore you would be disposed to accept any reasonable proof of his existence such a proof has been given and you have accepted it well then if we admit a divinity why not divine worship and if worship why not religion to teach this worship and if some religion why not the christian one if we cant find a better one and christianity is already established by the laws of our country and handed down to us from our forefathers are we to believe in a god yet not pray to him for future benefits or thank him for past ones not trust in his protection or love his goodness or praise his wisdom or marvel at his power and if these things are to be done can we do them in any way that is more suitable to the dignity of god and man than the way laid down by the christian religion i am not perhaps altogether sure that religion must be absolutely bad for the public but i hate to see religion walk hand in hand with considerations of government and social order i dont like to see human rights tied to religion i am not in favour of any kind of governing high priest he reels off a list of countries that have had such i knew a witty freethinker hes dead now who was a great admirer of the ancient druids he detested the present established religion but used to say that he would like to see the druids and their religion restored as it flourished in gaul and britain in ancient times it would be a good thing he thought that there should be a number of thoughtful men set apart to preserve knowledge of arts and sciences to educate youth and to teach men the immortality of the soul and the moral virtues that is what the ancient druids did he said and id be glad to see them once more established among us how would you like it alciphron that priests should have power to decide all controversies settle disputes about property distribute rewards and punishments that anyone who didnt submit to their decrees should be excommunicated regarded with disgust excluded from all honours and privileges and deprived of the common benefit of the laws and that from time to time a number of laymen should be crammed together in a wickerwork idol and burned to death as an offering to their pagan gods how would you like living under such priests and such a religion not at all such a state of affairs would be utterly unacceptable to freethinkers but thats what the druids and their religion were like if we can trust cæsars account of them im now more than ever convinced that there ought to be no such thing as an established religion of any kind certainly all the nations of the world have until now been out of their wits even the atheniansthe wisest and freest people on earthhad whoknowswhat foolish attachment to their established church they offered it seems a monetary reward to whoever would kill diagoras of melos a freethinking contemporary who laughed at their mysteries and protagoras another of the same sort narrowly escaped being put to death for writing something that seemed to contradict their accepted notions of the gods thats how our noble sect was treated in ancient athens and i have no doubt that your druids would have sacrificed many a holocaust berkeleys word of freethinkers i wouldnt give a farthing to exchange one religion for another away with them all together root and branch anything less than that isnt worth doing no druids or priests of any sort for me i see no place in the world for any of them this reminds me of how we ended our last philosophical conversation we agreed that next time we would return to the point we had then just begun on namely the use or benefit of the christian religion which alciphron challenged crito to show im all the readier to take this up because i dont think it is hard to do one great mark of christianitys truth is in my view its tendency to do good it seems to be the north star a principal guide to navigation at sea that guides all our judgments about practical matters including moral ones because these are always connected with universal benefit but to think straight about this matter we should try to do what lysicles did in an earlier conversation see pages taking account of things as a whole going as far as we possibly can in seeing how principles branch out into consequences in its four occurrences in this paragraph principle means source or seed see euphranor on pages we neednt pay much attention to the moods or whims or imaginary distresses of a few idle men whose ideas may be offended though their conscience cant be wounded what we have to do is to consider fairly the true interests of individuals as well as of human society now as is evident to anyone who gets his notion of it from the gospel the christian religion is a fountain of light joy and peace a source of faith hope and charity so it has to be a principle of happiness and virtue youd have to be blind not to see that destroying the principles of good actions must destroy good actions as for someone who sees this and yet persists in trying to destroy the principlesif he isnt wicked who is it seems to me that any man who can see in some depth and some breadth must be aware of his own misery sinfulness and dependence perceive that this present world is not designed or adapted to make rational souls happy welcome the chance to get into a better state and be overjoyed to find that the road leading to that better state involves loving god and man practising every virtue living reasonably while we are here on earth proportioning the value we put on things to the value they actually have and using this world without misusing it thats what christianity requires it doesnt require the cynics nastiness or the numbness of the stoic can there be a higher ambition than to overcome the world or a wiser ambition than to subdue ourselves or a more comfortable doctrine than the forgiveness of sins or a more joyful prospect than that of having our low nature renovated and assimilated to the deity our being made fellowcitizens with angels and sons of god did pythagoreans or platonists or stoics ever propose to the mind of man purer means or a nobler end how much of our happiness depends on hope how totally is hope extinguished by the minute philosophy on the other hand how it is cherished and raised by the gospel let anyone who thinks seriously consider these things and then say which he thinks deserves better of mankindhe who recommends christianity or he who runs it down which does he think is likelier to lead a happy life to be a hopeful son an honest dealer a worthy patriothe who sincerely believes the gospel or he who doesnt believe a word of ithe who aims at being a child of god or he who is content to be known as one of epicuruss hogs just look at the characters and behaviour of average examples of the two sorts of men and then say which sort live in a way that accords best with the dictates of reason the preparer of this text asked anthony long uc berkeley for help with epicuruss hogs and this was part of his reply included with permission in the last verse of horaces little epistle to tibullus he describes himself to his fellow poet as a hog from epicuruss herd in his selfmocking context horace says that he has been observing the epicurean rule of living carefree for the day when you want to laugh you will see me sleek and fat in fine shape a hog horace knows that the true epicurean is not a voluptuary but he ironically echoes that stock prejudice its amazing to see how different things look when they are viewed in different lights or by different eyes the picture i have of religion is very unlike yours crito when i consider how it unmans the soul filling it with absurd dreams and slavish fears how it extinguishes the gentle passions inspiring a spirit of malice and rage and persecution when i see bitter resentments and unholy wrath in the very men who preach meekness and charity to others perhaps gentlemen of your sect think that religion is a subject beneath their attention but it seems to me that someone who sets about opposing any doctrine ought to know what he is opposing so ill tell you religion is the virtuous mean between disbelief and superstition we dont defend superstitious follies or the rage of bigots what we plead for is religion against irreligion law against confusion virtue against vice the hope of a christian against the despondency of an atheist i wont defend bitter resentments and unholy wrath in any man much less in a christian and least of all in a clergyman but if even the best christians sometimes produce outbursts of angry emotion that wont surprise anyone who reflects on the sarcasms and rudeness with which christians are treated by the minute philosophers for as cicero remarks somewhere an insult has a sting that a wise and good man will find it hard to bear he says it in latin but even if you sometimes see particular selfprofessed christians going to faulty extremes of any kind through passion and weakness while unbelievers of a calmer and cooler temperament sometimes behave better this contrast proves nothing in favour of disbelief or against christianity if a believer acts badly that is because of the man not of his belief and if an unbeliever does good that is because of the man not of his unbelief you wont deny that the clergy are regarded as physicians of the soul and that religion is a sort of medicine that they deal in and administer well now if very many souls are diseased and lost how can we think that their the physician is skillful or that his medicine is good its a common complaint that vice increases and men grow more wicked by the day if a shepherds flock is diseased or unsound who is to blame but the shepherd for neglecting them or not knowing how to cure them i have nothing but contempt for such shepherds such medicine and such physicians who do what all hucksters douse grave and elaborate speeches to peddle their pills to the people who are never the better for them it seems utterly reasonable to say that we should base our judgment of a physician and his medicine on the medicines effect on the sick but tell me lysicles would you judge a physician by the sick who take his medicine and follow his prescriptions or by those who dont doubtless by those who do well then what are we to say if great numbers of sick people refuse to take the medicine and instead of it take poison of a directly opposite nature that has been prescribed by others whose concern it is to discredit the physician and his medicines to block men from using them and to destroy their effect by drugs of their own is the physician to blame for the health troubles of those people by no means by the same line of argument doesnt it follow that the tendency of religious doctrines should be judged by the effects they produce not on all who hear them but only on those who accept or believe them it seems so if we are to be fair then shouldnt we judge the effects of religion by the religious of faith by believers of christianity by christians but i suspect there are very few of these sincere believers still wont it suffice to justify our principles if in proportion to the numbers who accept them and the strength of the faith with which they are accepted they produce good effects there may be more such believers than you think and if there arent isnt that the fault of those who make it their proclaimed purpose to lessen that number and who are those but the minute philosophers i say it is owing to the clergy themselves to the wickedness and corruption of clergymen and who denies that there may be minute philosophers even among the clergy in such a numerous a body there are bound to be men of all sorts but despite the cruel reproaches flung at the clergy by their enemies i think that any fairminded observer of men and things will be inclined to regard those reproaches as revealing faults in those who fling them as much as in the clergy at whom they are flungespecially if he takes into account the strident tone of those who censure the clergy i dont know enough of the world to claim to judge the virtue merit and wideranging accomplishments of men in the various professions and anyway i dont like the odious work of comparison but im willing to say this the clergy in this region where i live are by no means a disgrace to it on the contrary the people seem to profit greatly from their example and doctrine but supposing the clergy to be sinners and faulty as of course all men certainly are supposing you could detect here and there among them great crimes and vices what inference can you draw against the profession itself from its unworthy practitioners any more than the pride pedantry and bad lives of some philosophers creates a case against philosophy or those of lawyers a case against law it is certainly right to judge principles from their effects but then we must know them to be effects of those principles its precisely the method i have followed with respect to religion and the minute philosophy i can honestly say that i never knew any man or family become worse in proportion as they became religious but i have often observed that minute philosophy is the worst thing that can get into a family the easiest way to impoverish divide and disgrace it what i have observed by this same method of tracing causes from their effects is that the love of truth virtue and the happiness of mankind are good stuff for speeches but they arent what drive the clergy in their work if they were why would clergymen beas they all areso fond of abusing human reason disparaging natural religion and trashing the philosophers and scientists not all its true that a christian favours confining reason within its proper bounds but so does every reasonable man if we are forbidden to get involved with unprofitable questions empty philosophy and science that isnt really science it doesnt follow that all inquiries into profitable questions useful philosophy and real science are unlawful no man of good sense will make those inferences it is generally acknowledged that there is a natural religion that can be discovered and proved by the light of reason to those who are capable of such proofs but still it has to be admitted that precepts and oracles from heaven are incomparably better suited to the improvement of ordinary folk and the good of society than are the reasonings of philosophers thats why we dont find that natural or rational religion ever became the popular national religion of any country it cant be denied that in all heathen countries a world of fables and superstitious rites have been accepted under the colour of religion but i question whether they were as absurd and harmful as they are vulgarly said to have been because their respective legislators and magistrates see note on page must surely have thought them useful we dont deny that there was something useful in the old religions of rome and greece and some other pagan countries on the contrary we freely admit that they had some good effects on the people but these good effects came from the truths contained in those false religionsthe more truth a religion contained therefore the more useful it was i think youll have difficulty producing any useful truth any moral precept any healthy principle or notion in any nonchristian system of religion or philosophy that isnt included in the christian religion where it is either enforced by stronger motives or supported by better authority or carried to a higher point of perfection so you want us to think ourselves a finer people than the ancient greeks or romans if by finer you mean better perhaps we are and if we arent its not because we have the christian religion but because too many of us dont alciphron protests that critos perhaps we are is indefensible he contrasts cicero and brutus with an english patriot and seneca with one of our parsons crito replies that those great men were not the minute philosophers of their times and that the best of their principles were also christian ones he adds that the current standing of some of the great men of the ancient world is partly due to their undeniable personal merits partly to favourable publicity and not at all to their not being christian as for more recent times a careful look shows a great deal of moral improvement in europe under the influence of christianity for a start he says lets take a look at england i have heard much of the glorious light of the gospel and would be glad to see some effects of it in my own dear countrywhich is incidentally one of the most corrupt and profligate on earth despite the boasted purity of our religion but you wouldnt be showing much confidence in your religion if you compared it only with that of the barbarous heathen from whom we are derived if you want to honour your religion have the courage to make your comparison with the most renowned heathens of antiquity it is a common prejudice to despise the present and overrate remote times and things theres a touch of this in the judgments men make concerning the ancient greeks and romans those nations certainly did produce some noble spirits and great patterns of virtue but overall they seem to me to have been much inferior in real virtue and good morals to our corrupt and profligate nation so you called it to bring dishonour to our religion i wonder how you would choose to describe it when you wanted to do honour to the minute philosophy crito backs up his statement about the greeks and romans by citing examples the treatment of slaves and prisoners of war killing of unwanted children gladiators and also bacchanals and unbridled lusts of every kind these dont have parallels in contemporary england he says largely because of christianity alciphron replies that crito is overlooking facts that dont fit his views citing the inhumanity of that barbarous custom of duelling crito agrees that duelling is bad i shant make an apology for every goth that walks the streets with a determined purpose to murder any man who spits in his face or calls him a liar he goes on to say that christianity isnt responsible for this and alciphron says that thats irrelevant to the immediate present topic which is just a comparison of contemporary england with ancient greece and rome crito accepts this and returns to the comparison they were making saying that duelling isnt as bad as the common roman practice of poisoning thats very true duelling is not as general a nuisance as poisoning and its not so low either this crime if it is a crime has a good chance of holding on despite the law and the gospel the clergy never preach against it because they dont suffer from it personally and a man of honour mustnt appear to oppose the means of vindicating honour which is what duelling is you arent the first freethinker to say that the clergy are not given to preaching against duelling but in my view that remark itself is unfair and so is your statement about why the clergy stay away from this topic in effect half of their sermonsall that is said about charity brotherly love forbearance meekness and forgiving injuriesis directly against this wicked custom of duelling as for the claim that they never suffer from it themselves that is so far from true that one can make a case for saying that they suffer from it oftener than other men how can you make good on that claim the ferocity of this passage suggests that it reflects berkeleys own personal experiences of being bullied by cowards there are two kinds of bully the fighting and the tame both public nuisances the fighting bully is the more dangerous animal but there are far fewer of them than of tame bullies the tame bully exerts his talents against clergymen which the fighting bully never does the qualities of a man that make him count as a tame bully are natural rudeness combined with a delicate sense of dangermeaning danger to himself you see the fashionable custom of calling men to account for their behaviour ie challenging them to a duel has not lessened the force of inbred insolence and bad manners it has merely turned that force in a new direction so you can often see one of these tame bullies nearly bursting with offended pride and bad temper that he dares not express openly because he is afraid of being challenged to a duel until a parson comes his way providing reliefie giving his angry state a safe outlet but to return to our topic can you deny that the ancient romans were as famous for justice and integrity as todays men are for the opposite qualities you cant get the character of the romans from the opinions of cicero the actions of cato or a few shining episodes scattered through their history what you need to consider is the prevailing tenor of their lives and notions and then he says the picture changes and he goes on to cite examples of atrocious publicly approved conduct by the romans then i venture to say that if you take roman history from one end to the other and impartially compare it with our own you wont find the romans to be as good as you imagine or your countrymen to be as bad on the contrary i really do think that an unbiased eye will detect a vein of charity and justicean effect of christian principlesrunning through england today crito paused and alciphron spoke up addressing himself to euphranor and me it is natural for men according to their various upbringings and prejudices to form opposite judgments about the same things crito for instance imagines that religion has only salutary effects but if you appeal to the general experience and observation of other men youll find that the statement tantum religio potuit suadere malorum has grown into a proverb which says that religion is the root of evil it was said by lucretius and wasnt a generalization about religion speaking of agamemnons sacrifice of his daughter to a goddess in the hope of getting favourable winds for his attack on troy lucretius wrote so greatly was religion able to persuade a man to do evil not just among epicureans or other ancient heathens but among moderns speaking of the christian religion i think it is unreasonable to set up against the general concurring opinion of the world the observation of a particular person or a particular set of zealots whose prejudice sticks close to them and keeps mixing in with their judgmentszealots who read draw conclusions and observe with an eye not to discovering the truth but to defending their prejudice notice how nasty the tone has become this is said about crito in his presence but not addressed to him directly although i cant share alciphrons views i admire his skill and dexterity in argument sometimes he represents an opinions acceptance by people in general as a sure sign of its being wrong but when that doesnt suit his purposes he just as easily makes it a sure sign of truth but the fact that an irreligious proverb is used by the friends and admired authors of a minute philosopher doesnt imply that the proverb is something generally accepted still less that it is a truth based on the experience and observation of mankind and this one isnt a truth it would be as reasonable to think that darkness is a natural effect of sunshine as to think that sullen and furious passions come from the glad tidings and divine precepts of the gospel the sum and substance the scope and end of christs religion is the love of god and man all other doctrines and duties whether legal or moral are subordinate to this as parts of it means to it signs of it principles arising from it motives to adhere to it or effects of it tell me now how could evil or wickedness of any kind comes from such a source i dont say that there are no evil qualities in christians or that there are no good ones in minute philosophers but i do say this whatever evil there is in us our principles certainly lead to good and whatever good there may be in you it is most certain that your principles lead to evil it must be admitted that christianity looks handsome on the outside and many plausible things can be said in favour of the christian religion taken simply as we find it in the gospel he goes on to report the view of one of our great writers shaftesbury that the first christian preachers sneakily made christianity look goodall love charity meekness patience and so forthuntil they had converted much of the world and come to have political power and then they soon changed their appearance and showed cruelty ambition avarice and every bad quality crito responds that this is very stupid the first christian preachers died for their faith and yet ever since this religion has appeared in the world we have had eternal feuds factions massacres and wars the very reverse of that hymn with which it is introduced in the gospel glory be to god on high on earth peace goodwill towards men crito accepts this adds that christianity was often the pretext for these evils but insists that this doesnt mean it was their cause he then says that the evils of the christian era were matched and outnumbered by evils in prechristian times all these evils early and late were the common product of the passions and vices of mankind which are sometimes covered with the mask of religion by wicked men who have the form of godliness without the power of it this is so obviously true that im surprised that any man of sense knowledge and candour can doubt it he returns to ancient rome with more examples of horrors alciphron agrees that the romans had a high and fierce spirit which produced very bloody catastrophes but the ancient greeks he says were a civilized and gentle sort of men softened by arts and philosophy crito replies that the little states and cities of greece as alciphron calls them had their factions which persecuted each other with such treachery rage and malice that our factious folk are mere lambs by comparison for evidence of this he refers to thucydides history of the war between athens and sparta and he expresses contempt for freethinkers divers to the bottom of things fair inquirers and openers of eyes who are capable of such a gross mistake as sentimentalising ancient greece the rest of mankind we could more easily give up but as for the greeks men of the most refined genius express a high esteem of them not only on account of the qualities that you think fit to allow them but also for their virtues on the basis of the fullest and fairest observation i can make i think that if virtue stands for truth justice and gratitude there is incomparably more virtue right now in england than could ever be found in ancient greece he goes on about the ingratitude that some greek states showed to some of their citizens who had been benefactors and then moves on to this as for the source of the chief advantage of the greeks and romans and other nations that have made the greatest figure in the world im inclined to think it was their special reverence for the laws and institutions of their countries these inspired them with steadiness and courage and with the heartfelt and noble love of their country and what they understood to be their country was not confined by language or ethnic origin still less by geographical location their notion of their country also took in a certain system of manners customs notions rites and civil and religious laws i can see your drift you want us to revere the laws and religious institutions of our country well excuse us if we dont see fit to imitate the greeks or to be governed by any authority whatsoever im sure you dont if islam were established by law i dont doubt that the freethinkersthe very ones who applaud turkish maxims and manners so loudly that youd think they were ready to turn turkishwould be the first to protest against them but to return to our topic i agree that there always have been wars and factions in the world and that there always will be on some pretext or other as long as men are men but theres a specifically christian sort of war and sort of warrior one that the heathens had no notion of the noun divine has been replaced by theologian in this version but its occurrence in this paragraph and the next is left unaltered for reasons that youll see im talking about disputes in theology the wars and polemical divines the warriors which the world has been amazingly pestered with if you take their word for it they are teaching peace meekness harmony and whatnot but even a cursory look at how they behave shows them to have been all through the centuries the most contentious quarrelsome disagreeing crew that ever appeared on earth the skill and trickery the zeal and eagerness with which the scholastic divines those barbarians split hairs and quarrel over nonexistent imagined things is more absurd and a greater scandal to human reason than all the ambitious intrigues plots and politics of the court of ancient rome and makes me even angrier than those do if divines are quarrelsome its not because they are divine but because they are undivine and unchristian justice is a good thing and so is the art of healing yet men can be wronged in the administering of justice or poisoned in the giving of medicine but just as wrong cant be justice or an effect of justice and poison cant be medicine or an effect of medicine so also pride or strife cant be religion or an effect of religion having said that i agree that you can often see hotheaded bigots signing up with religious parties as well as political ones without being of credit or service to either for the next bit you need to remember that the scholastics were roman catholic philosophical theologians while berkeley was an anglican as for the scholastics in particular i dont think the christian religion has any need to defend them their doctrines or their method of handling them still however futile their views may be and however clumsy their language its simply not true that they sneer and scold and rant in their writings and they are so far from showing fury or passion that an impartial judge might rate them far ahead of the minute philosophers in keeping close to the point and in their tone and good manners but anyway if men are puzzled tangle with one another talk nonsense and quarrel about religion they do the same about law medicine politics and everything else that matters its not just in divinity that men run into disputes trickery nonsense and contradictions it also happens in the other professions i have mentioned and indeed in any pursuit where men have created abstract theory but this doesnt stop there being many excellent rules sound ideas and useful truths in all those professions in all disputes human emotions too often get stirred into the mix in proportion as the subject is thought to be more or less important but we oughtnt to confuse the cause of man with the cause of god or make human follies an objection to divine truths its easy to distinguish what looks like wisdom from above from what comes from the passion and weakness of men the distinction is so obvious that when someone doesnt draw it one might be tempted to think that this is a result not of ignorance but of something worse the hostile tone isnt improving the conduct we cite in objections to minute philosophers is a natural consequence of their principles anything they can cite in objections to us is an effect not of our principles but of human passion and frailty oh terrific so we must no longer cite in objections against christians the absurd contentions of councils the cruelty of inquisitions the ambition and powergrabbing of churchmen you can cite them as objections against christians but not against christianity if the divine author of our religion and his disciples have sowed a good seed and if together with this good seed the enemies of his gospel including the minute philosophers of all ages have sowed bad seeds from which weeds and thistles grow isnt it obvious that these bad weeds cant be blamed on the good seed or on those who sowed it he develops this point at considerable and not very interesting length alciphron responds by shifting to a different complaint the triviality and unimportance of much theological writing i shant undertake to vindicate theological writings as such a general defence of them would be as needless as a general accusation is groundless but let them speak for themselves and dont condemn them on the word of a minute philosopher anyway lets look at the worst case imagine a quarrelsome pedant in divinity who disputes and ruminates and writes on some refined point that is as useless and unintelligible as you please but then ask yourself what would have become of this man if he had been brought up to be a layman rather than a cleric mightnt he have employed himself in shifty business deals harassing lawsuits factions seditions and such like amusements doing much more harm to the public than he actually does with his useless theological studies the two pages between here and occupy five pages in the original they arent of much philosophical interest alciphron complains that in theological disputes what men lack in light they commonly make up in heat crito replies that in any branch of study when some isolated point is being looked into with great care that tends to generate an inflated sense of its importance but this is routine stuff and not special to theology alciphron complains that trivial theological squabbles are regarded as learning and the public takes an interest in them as though they were sporting events he objects to theological writings on stylistic grounds what man of sense or breeding would not detest the infection of longwinded pulpit eloquence or of that dry formal pedantic stiff and clumsy style that smells of the lamp and the college those who are foolish enough to admire the universities as centres of learning must think that my reproach smells of the college is a strange one but it is perfectly fair these days the ablest men agree that the universities are merely hotbeds of prejudice corruption barbarism and pedantry speaking for myself i find no fault with universities all i know is that i had three hundred pounds a year to spend in one of them and it was the happiest time of my life as for their books and style of writingi didnt have time to pay any attention to them whoever wants to pull weeds will never lack work theres no shortage of bad books on every subject i dont know what theological writings alciphron and his friends are familiar with but i venture to say that our english theologians include many writers who for breadth of learning solidity of content strength of argument and purity of style are not inferior to any writers in our language as for our universities which are of course imperfect any impartial observer will find that with all their flaws they are better than universities in other countries and much better than the mean picture that minute philosophers draw of them its natural that the loudest complaints against places of education come from those who have profited least by them crito mistakes the point i am relying on the authority not of a dunce or a rake or an absurd parent examples that crito has used but of the most accomplished critic this age has produced this great man characterizes men of the church and universities with the finest touches and most masterly pencil what do you think he calls them what why the black tribe magicians formalists pedants bearded boys and after having sufficiently derided and exploded them and their mean and crude learning he provides the most admirable models of good writing namely his own writings they have to be acknowledged as the finest things in our languageas i could easily convince you for i also have with me something by that noble writer after an exchange about a noble writer who is also a nobleman in fact shaftesbury alciphron takes a book from his pocket and starts to read a long flowery unclear passage in which idleness is praised as being better than busy greed it is quoted verbatim from shaftesburys book characteristics of etc except that berkeley mischievously puts it on the page as fifty lines blank verse of which this is typical but here a busy form solicits us active industrious watchful and despising pains and labour she wears the serious countenance of virtue but with features of anxiety and disquiet what ist she mutters what looks she on with such admiration and astonishment and so on until euphranor interrupts with a protest why should we interrupt our discussion to read a play it isnt a play or poetry alciphron replies but a famous modern critic moralizing in prose he goes on about this great mans discoveries and his writings euphranor comments sarcastically on the kind of man who offers to reform the style and taste of the age and alciphron not hearing the sarcasm continues enthusiastically about the admired critic of our times who has among other things argued that shakespeare milton and others have been greatly overrated euphranor asks what effect this great man has had on the public do they aspire to his sublimity or imitate his chaste unaffected style alciphron still naively enthusiastic says that the taste of the age is much mended crito gets in a slap at the writingstyle of minute philosophers and then shifts the conversation back towards where it was a few minutes ago when your great man tells us that ignorance and ill taste are due to the christian religion or the clergy i cant just take his word for it the truth is the opposite of that crito says in a speech that is summed up in this everyone who knows anything knows that we are indebted for our learning to the greek and latin tongues and that we are indebted for those tongues to our religion what else could have made foreign and dead languages in such demand among us alciphron speaks harshly of one sort of learning that is undoubtedly of christian origin and special to the universitieshe deplores the years that young people waste in acquiring the mysterious jargon of scholasticism and the further years they have to spend being untaught it by the world but what if this scholastic learning was not of christian but of moslem origin being derived from the arabs and what if this complaint about gentlemens spending several years in learning and unlearning this jargon is just a sham and this is said sarcastically a specimen of the truth and candour of certain minute philosophers surely it wouldnt be such a deplorable loss of time if a young gentleman spent a few months on the much despised and decried art of logica surplus of logic is by no means the prevailing nuisance of this age it is one thing to waste ones time learning and unlearning the barbarous terms ultrafine distinctions and longwinded sophistry of the scholastics its another to attain some exactness in defining and arguingthings that may be not altogether beneath the dignity even of a minute philosopher logic used to be regarded as its own objectie a selfsufficient subject all on its ownso that the art of reasoning instead of being transferred to things was aimed only at words and abstractions which produced a sort of leprosy in all branches of knowledge but those times are past and logiconce cultivated as the chief branch of knowledgeis now considered in another light it doesnt play anything like the part in the studies of young gentlemen at the universities that is attributed to it by those admirable reformers of religion and learning the minute philosophers crito goes on to say that the restoration of arts and civilized learning has been due to the influence of christians whom he names at length in the course of this he speaks of the great scholars who flourished on the other side of the alps in the golden age as the italians call it of pope leo the tenth and alciphron challenges this saying that the noble critic from whom he quoted a few minutes ago regards the italians as corrupters of true learning and erudition crito replies with some slighting remarks about the noble critic and surprisingly lysicles backs him up saying in effect that someone who writes so much about art and taste and critical skill oughtnt to write as badly as that man shaftesbury does in the course of some further skirmishing between alciphron and crito about whether and to what extent english culture is indebted to church or universities or ancient languages crito speaks of christianity as a generator of arts and sciences and also of the general sense of virtue and humanity and the belief in a providence and afterlife which all the argumentation of minute philosophers has not yet been able to abolish that remark brings the topic of christianityandculture to an end because alciphron replies it is strange that you still persist in arguing as though all the gentlemen of our sect were enemies to virtue and downright atheists when i have assured you that on the contrary we have among us a number of people who announce their support for virtue and natural religion and i have also assured you that i myself now argue on that basis how can you claim to support natural religion and yet be open enemies of christianity which is the only established religion that includes whatever is excellent in natural religion and which is the only means of making those precepts duties and notions become reverenced throughout the world suppose someone tried to persuade people that he was greatly in support of a particular earthly monarch that he loved and admired his government while at the same time he took every opportunity to express himself as a most bitter enemy of the very persons and methods that contributed most to the monarchs service and to making his dignity known and revered his laws observed or his dominion extendedwouldnt such a person be thought weak or insincere and isnt this just what minute philosophers like you do announce themselves as advocates of god and religion and yet do all they can to discredit christians and their worship admittedly you argue against christianity in one way that doesnt necessarily express hostility to religion as such namely by representing christianity as the cause of evil and wickedness in the world but that line of argument could be used with equal force against civil government food and drink every faculty and profession learning eloquence and even against human reason itself and even those of your sect who allow themselves to be called deists if their views are thoroughly examined will be found to include little religion in them as for gods providence watching over our conduct and dispensing blessings or hardships the immortality of the soul the last judgment and an afterlife with rewards and punishments those are great points of natural religion but how few if any of your freethinkers have tried to get men to have a serious sense of them how many go the opposite way trying to make the belief in them shaky or ridiculous when a mans declared principles and personal beliefs are utterly subversive of the things listed above anything he says about virtue piety and religion will be understood as merely playing safe and not being conspicuous frankly i have never had any liking for religion of any kind revealed or unrevealed whats unrevealed is natural religion and i venture to say the same for any gentlemen of our sect that i am acquainted with having never known any of them do anything as low as use the word god with reverence or express respect for piety or for any sort of worship he adds details about ways in which a minute philosopher may talk as though he had respect for christianity explaining that this is never to be taken seriously and literally then after all these arguments and ideas that beget one another without end here is my view in a nutshell my friends and i cant for the life of us see why man mightnt do very well and govern himself without any religion at all brutes do it and they are thought to be less capable than men you say that brutes have instincts senses appetites and passions to steer and conduct them well men have all those and also have reason that they can consult when they need to from these premises my friends and i conclude the road of human life is well enough lit without religion brutes dont have much power of thought and it is confined to particular things that are present to the animal so they are sufficiently restrained and kept in order by the force or faculties of other animals and by the skill of man and conscience and religion dont come into this in contrast with that human reason is a faculty of vast extent and power especially power to do mischief and conscience is a necessary balance to it and another point by the law of their nature nonhuman animals are pushed to one particular end or manner of existence without inclination or means either to deviate from that or to go beyond it but man has in him a will and higher principle through which he can pursue different or even contrary ends and he can fall short of or exceed the perfection natural to his species in this world just as he can either hand over control to his sensual appetites thereby degrading himself into the condition of brutes or else wellorder and improve his mind thereby upgrading himself into something resembling an angel man is the only animal with enough understanding to know his god whats the use of this knowledge if it isnt to ennoble man to raise him to a level where he is more like god and more in touch with god and what would the good of such ennoblement be if it ended with this life and how can these things happen without religion but we have already discussed at great length the topics of vice and virtue man and beast sense and intellect lysicles surely you dont want us to go back to where we were three or four days ago by no means i would much rather go forward and make an end as soon as possible but to save us all trouble let me tell you once for all that whatever you say youll never persuade me that so many able and agreeable men are in the wrong and a pack of snarling sour bigots in the right o lysicles i dont look for religion among bigots or for reason among libertines each kind disgrace their respective positionsthe bigot exerting an angry zeal for things that hardly matter and the libertine paying no attention to even the plainest and most important truths and surely whatever there is thats silly narrow and uncharitable in the bigot the same is in great measure to be attributed to the conceited ignorance and petulant irreligion of the libertine lysicles ignored this and rounded on alciphron i have always thought he said that nothing could be sillier than to think of destroying christianity by praising natural religion you cant consistently think well of one and poorly of the other because its obvious that natural religion needs the help of revealed religion if it is ever to be established and accepted anywhere except in the brains of a few idle speculative men i knew what your concessions would come to anyone with half an eye can see that the belief in god virtue an afterlife and such fine notions are the very basis and cornerstone of the christian religion give them this foundation to build on and youll soon see what superstructures our theologians will raise from it admit the truth and importance of those doctrines and you dont have to be a conjurer to prove from that the excellence and usefulness of the christian religion and then of course there must be priests to teach and propagate this useful religion and if there are priests provision will have to made for their maintenance enabling them to perform all their rites and ceremonies in a decent fashion and to keep their sacred character respected and the plain upshot of all this is that the monarch will ally himself with the priesthood in order to subdue the people so we have opened the gates to a long procession of ecclesiastical evils priestcraft hierarchy inquisition we have lost our liberty and property the nation has been put to vast expense simply to purchase bridles for our mouths and saddles for our backs he said this with some sharpness of tone and a scolding manner alciphron was upset but said nothing and showed confusion in his looks crito looked at euphranor and me with a smile then looking over at the two philosophers he said if youll allow me to intervene to prevent a rupture between old friends and brethren in opinion i would remark that in what lysicles has just said there is something right and something wrong it seems right to assert as he does that a real belief in natural religion will lead a man to approve of revealed religion but it is wrong to say that inquisitions tyranny and ruin must follow from this your freethinkersno offence meantseem to mistake where their strength lies they imagine strongly but reason weakly they are mighty in exaggeration but thin in argument isnt there some way to relieve them from the terror of that fierce and bloody animal an english parson wont it be enough to trim his talons without chopping off his fingers then they are such wonderful defenders of liberty and property he tells an antipope story to illustrate his thesis that we may see every day both things and notions being attributed to liberty and property that in fact dont have and arent meant to have anything to do with either of them really is it impossible for a man to be a christian without being a slave or to be a clergyman without having the principles of an inquisitor i am far from shielding and justifying the greed for domination or tyrannical power in ecclesiastics some who have been guilty of that have paid dearly for it and it is to be hoped they always will but once we have calmed the fury and folly of the ambitious bishop isnt it time to look see whether some evil mightnt come to the state from a different sourcethe overflowing zeal of an independent whig ie a believer in primitive christianity who is opposed to the established church of england ill tell you this without bothering to prove it the worst tyranny this nation ever felt was from the hands of patriots of that kind i dont know tyranny is a harsh word and is sometimes misapplied when spirited men with independent views create a ferment or make a change in the state those who lose by the changes are apt to consider things in one light and those who win to consider them in another in the mean time this is certainly good policy we should be sparing with our money and keep it for better uses than to spend on the church and religion what follows is a longish discussion of propertyrights the legal basis for the ownership of land by the church and so on then i can never hope crito to make you think that my schemes are reasonable you and i each argue correctly on our own principles and well never agree until we drop our principles and that cant be done by reasoning we all talk of just and right and wrong and public good and so on we use the same names but our notions and conclusions are very different perhaps diametrically opposite and yet the conclusions on each side may admit of clear proofs and be inferred by the same method of reasoning for instance the members of a club i belong to define man as sociable animal and so we dont count as men the human creatures of whom it can be said that we prefer their absence to their presence by this standard its clear that men of pleasure goodhumoured men and men of wit are the only human creatures who properly and truly count as men therefore whatever is conducive to good incomes for them is for the good of mankind and consequently very just and lawful even though it seems to bring loss or harm to other creatures i say seems because no real harm can be done in respect of life or property to those who dont know how to enjoy life and property we hold this on the basis of clear and well connected reasoning but others may view things in another light give different definitions draw different conclusions and perhaps regard as a wart or tumour of human nature what we think to be the top and flower of the creation from all which there must arise a very different system of morals politics rights and notions lysicles then swing into a jokey classification of men that someone invented in which kinds of men at given the names of kinds of animals thus according to this system the fishes are the men who swim in pleasure the beasts are dry drudging covetous rapacious folk and all those addicted to trouble and business like oxen and other dry land animals which spend their lives in labour and fatigue the birds are airy notional men enthusiasts projectors poets philosophers and such like if you ask me which species of mankind i like best i answer the flying fish ie a man of animal enjoyment with a mixture of whim thus you see we have our creeds and our systems just as more solemn folk do with this difference that our systems are not straitlaced not strapped on tightly but sit easy to be slipped off or on as the mood takes us or the occasion serves and now i can listen with the greatest equanimity imaginable to my opinions being argued against or refuted i wish all men were like that but youll find a sort of meni neednt name the sortthat cant endure having their opinions examined or their faults criticized they are against reason because reason is against them we freethinkers are all for liberty of conscience if our tenets are absurd we allow them to be freely argued against and inspected and by parity of reasoning we might hope to be allowed the same privilege regarding the opinions of other men o alciphron wares that cant stand the light are indeed suspect so whatever moves you to make this complaint i promise you that i never will up to now i have allowed your reason its full scope and ill always do so in the future but for the love of truth be candid and dont spend your strength and our time on matters that arent significant or are irrelevant to our topic or have been agreed between us we allow that tyranny and slavery are bad things but why should we fear them from the clergy at this time we agree that rites and ceremonies arent of central importance in religion but why should we ridicule things that in their own nature are not bad and may be good and that bear the stamp of supreme authority i freely admit that men in theology as well as other subjects get tangled in useless disputes and will probably go on doing so till the end of the world but why must all the human weakness and mistakes of clergymen be attributed to wicked designs why indiscriminately abuse their character and their beliefs is this like candour love of truth and freethinking granted bad temper and illbreeding can occasionally be found in the clergy but arent the same faults found in english laymen who have spent their lives in a secluded rural environment i grant that theres endless futility in the works of the scholastics but i deny that a volume of that does as much harm as a page of minute philosophy that weak or wicked men should by favour of the world creep into power and high positions in the churchtheres nothing surprising in that and it is natural to suppose that once they are in those positions they will behave like themselves but through all this it is obvious that what drives them in their unworthy achievements is not the gospel but the world not the spirit but the flesh not god but the devil we dont shrink from agreeing that nothing is more infamous than vice and ignorance in a clergyman nothing lower than a hypocrite more trivial than a pedant more cruel than an inquisitor but you should agree in your turn gentlemen that nothing is more ridiculous and absurd than for pedantic ignorant and corrupt men to throw the first stone at every shadow of their own defects and vices in other men when i think about the detestable state of slavery and superstition i feel my heart swelling to take in the utter blessing of independent liberty this is the sacred and high privilege the very life and health of our english constitution so you mustnt be surprised if we with a vigilant and searching eye guard it against the minutest appearance of evil you must even allow us to cut around it going deep and using a magnifying glass so as better to see and extirpate every least speck that appears in the freedom that we are careful to preserve and angry to see threatened as for unrestricted liberty i leave that to savages who i think are the only ones who have it but as for the reasonable legal liberty of our constitution i most heartily and sincerely wish it may to survive and flourish among us for ever he says that any amount of vigilance is justified if it stops attempts to change our free and gentle government into a slavish or severe one but how he demands can one get out of this any basis for an attack on religion there follows an discussion of rights of suppression alciphron reports a magistrate who was so hardpressed by freethinkers that he couldnt find anything to say in defence of his religion except that if ten million people inhabiting the same island wanted to have laws establishing religion in certain ways and ten thousand able men publicly sneered at those laws the ten million would be entitled to expel the ten thousand out of the island and what answer would you make to this remark of the magistrate the answer is obvious by the law of nature which is superior to any human institutions intelligence and knowledge have a right to command folly and ignorance i say that able men have by natural right a dominion over fools this doctrine however was never thoroughly understood until quite recently after conversation about a hardpressed individual magistrate alciphron will now revert to using the magistrate in the manner described in a note on page as a kind of shorthand for the lawmaking and lawenforcing authorities of the country a generation back hobbes and his followersthough otherwise very great mendeclared in favour of the religion of the magistrate probably because they were afraid of the magistrate but times have changed and the magistrate may now be afraid of us crito briefly comments on this and then launches into an anecdote that starts a brief and inconclusive discussion of the legal requirement that only professed christians could serve on juries then this much is certain the christian reformed religion is a principal part and cornerstone of our free constitution and i really think it is the only thing that makes us deserve freedom and makes us able to enjoy it freedom is either a blessing or a curse depending on how men use it if our religion were wiped out among us and the ideas that are regarded by freethinkers as prejudices of a christian education were erased from the minds of britons it seems to me that the best thing that could then happen would be the loss of our freedom a people who have such restless ambition such strength of feeling such enmity between factions so much at stake in contests such unrestricted licence of speech and press amid so much wealth and luxurythe only thing that has so far kept them from ruin are the hoary old wives tales he uses a latin phrase quoting persius as on page that you claim to be wiping out under the christian religion this nation has been greatly improved from being a sort of savages we have become civilized polished and learned we have made a decent and noble figure both at home and abroad and as our religion decreases i am afraid we shall be found to have declined so why should we persist in that dangerous experiment one would think crito that you had forgotten the many calamities caused by churchmen and religion and one would think that you had forgotten what we said this very day in answer to that objection i dont want to go on for ever saying the same things so ill make just three points if we reflect on the past state of the christian world and especially of our country with our feuds and factions that existed while we all had the same religioneg the war of the roses so violent and bloody and longwe may well suspect that the nastiness that has more recently shown up under the mask of religion would have broken out under some other pretext if religion hadnt been available it doesnt follow from anything you can say about our history that the evils accidentally arising from religion bear any proportion to the good effects it has really produced or to the evils it has prevented the best things can accidentally give rise to evil and such an accidental effect is not strictly speaking produced by the good thing itself but by some evil thingnot a part property or effect of itthat happens to coincide with it i think we have given enough discussion to the topic of todays session i must acknowledge that theres something in what crito has said about the usefulness of the christian religion lysicles may not like this but i owe it to my status as a fair impartial adversary to say this ill even admit that some of our sect are in favour of tolerating christianity i remember a meeting of a number of able men where after much debate we passed three resolutions the first was that no religion ought to be tolerated in the state but this on more mature thought was judged impracticable the second was that all religions should be tolerated but none looked on with favour except atheism but it was feared that this might make trouble among the lower sort of people the third resolution was that some religion or other should be established for the use of the vulgar after a long dispute about which religion this should be it was proposed that the present religion might be tolerated until a better one was found but while i grant that christianity is expedient i can never think it true while there are unanswerable objections to it is it all right if i present those at our next meeting to which we all agreed sixth dialogue monday in the original work this is by a considerable margin the longest of the dialogues but not in this version from which much of the philosophically uninteresting material has been cut dion reports that on the sunday the various people spent the day in their characteristic ways then the next morning we assembled at the same place as on saturday and when we were all seated i remarked that during the preceding week our discussion had been longer and less interrupted than i had ever known in town where mens hours are broken by visits business and amusementsso much so that anyone who settles for forming his ideas wholly from conversation must end up with ideas that are very shattered and incomplete and what have we achieved replied alciphron through all these continued discussions for my part i think that with regard to the main point that divides us the truth of the christian religion im just where i was at the outset i answered that so many points had been examined discussed and agreed between him and his adversaries that i hoped to see them eventually agreeing on everything for in the first place i said the principles and opinions of those who are called freethinkers or minute philosophers have been pretty clearly explained it has been also agreed that vice isnt beneficial to the nation in the way that some men imagine it is that virtue is highly useful to mankind but that the beauty of virtue is not enough on its own to get men to be virtuous that therefore the belief in a god and providence ought to be encouraged in the state and tolerated in good company as a useful notion and it has been proved that there is a god that it is reasonable to worship him and that the worship faith and principles prescribed by the christian religion are a good influence alciphrons reply was addressed to even if everything that dion has just said is true he said that doesnt move me an inch from where i was at the outset regarding the main point thats because nothing in all this proves the truth of the christian religion though each of the details dion has listed might create a prejudice in its favour so i must be on my guard against being a prejudiced personprejudiced in favour of christianity as a lover of truth i must look sharp and consider carefully every step i take you may remember alciphron that you suggested as todays topic certain difficulties and objections that you had to offer against the christian religion we are now ready to hear and consider anything of that kind that you think fit to produce atheism and the wrong idea of christianity as something harmful to mankind are great prejudices and a mans losing them may make him more apt to argue with candour and submit to reasonable proof but losing prejudices against an opinion as you have done isnt the same as acquiring a prejudice in its favour as you fear you may have done so we have reason to hope that youll be able to do justice to your cause without being uncritically in love with it after a selfcongratulatory opening alciphron says that he will do his best to share with those who are wandering lower down in the narrow dark paths of error the view of things that he has achieved from his lofty stand above the reach of prejudice then know then that each of the various groups of men has a faith and a religious system that sprouts from the common grain of enthusiasm that they all havea grain that is a basic ingredient in the mix of human nature each group tells of communication with the invisible world revelations from heaven divine oracles and the like when i consider all these claims with an impartial eye i cant possibly assent to them all and i find within myself something that restrains me from assenting to any of them im willing to go where i am led by common sense and the light of nature but the same reason that tells me to yield to rational proof forbids me to accept opinions without proof this holds in general against all revelationsall let this be counted as my first objection against the christian religion in particular this objection presupposes that theres no proof or reason for believing the christian revelation so if good reason can be assigned for such a belief the objection comes to nothing now i presume youll agree that a true and proper reason for believing a report is the authority of the person who makes it and the better his authority the sounder the claim his report has to our assent well now the authority of god is on all accounts the best so it is most reasonable to believe anything that comes from god meaning anything that is told to us by god i agree but then you have to prove that it does come from god and arent miracles and the fulfilment of prophecies joined with the excellence of its doctrine a sufficient proof that the christian religion came from god miracles would indeed prove something but what proof have we of these miracles proof of the same kind that we do havethe only kind we can haveof events that occurred long ago and far away we have authentic accounts passed down to us from eyewitnesses whom we cant conceive to have been tempted to deceive us by any human motive whatsoever why cant we because in giving these accounts they were acting contrary to their interests their prejudices and the very principles in which they had been nursed and brought up these accounts were confirmed by the unparalleled razing of the city of jerusalem and the scattering of the jewish nation which is an enduring testimony to the truth of the gospel particularly of the predictions of our blessed saviour for example and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh luke within less than a century these accounts were spread throughout the world and believed by great numbers of people they were also written down translated into numerous languages and handed down with the same respect and consent of christians in the most distant churches dont you see said alciphron staring straight at crito that all this depends on tradition and tradition believe me gives only a weak hold it is a chain whose first links may be stronger than steel and yet the last ones weak as wax and brittle as glass imagine a picture copied successively by a hundred painters each copying from the one before how like the original will the last copy be how lively and clear will an image be after a hundred reflections between two parallel mirrors thats how like and lively i think a faint vanishing tradition will be at the end of sixteen or seventeen centuries some men have a false heart others a wrong head and even when heart and head are both good memory may be treacherous something gets added something omitted something varied from the truth and the cumulative result of many such additions deductions and alterations through the centuriesthe bottom lineis quite different from what the tradition started with we can know ancient facts by oral tradition or written tradition and a written tradition may be either private kept in the hands of particular men or public recorded in public archives now as far as i can see all these three sorts of tradition agree in attesting to the genuine antiquity of the gospels and they are strengthened by supplementary evidence from rites instituted festivals observed and buildingschurches baptistries and sepulchresput up by ancient christians granting that your objection holds against oral tradition on its own i cant think it is so difficult to transcribe faithfully and once something has been put in writing it is secure against slips of memory and can with reasonable care be preserved intact for as long as the manuscript lastswhich we know from experience can be more than a thousand years a tradition of more than sixteen hundred years needs only two or three links in its chain he gives an example and despite the great length of time those links may be very sound and unbroken and no reasonable man will deny that an ancient manuscript may be as credible now as when it was first written we have it on good authorityand anyway it seems probablethat the first christians were careful to transcribe copies of the gospels and epistles for their private use and that other copies were preserved as public records in many churches throughout the world and that portions of them were constantly read in their assemblies what more could be said to prove the authenticity of the writings of classic authors or ancient records of any kind alciphron turned to euphranor and said silencing an adversary is different from convincing himdont you agree euphranor oh yes they are different but what i want is to be convinced its not so clear to me that you do look however willing a man is to be convinced he cant be convinced by probable arguments when there is a demonstration going the other way i agree that he cant well it is as obvious as demonstration can make it that no divine faith can possibly be built on tradition take the case of an honest credulous farmer who is drilled and lectured every sunday by his parish priest clearly its the parson he believes in not god all he knows about revelations doctrines and miracles is what the priest tells him he believes all this and his faith is purely human if you say he has the liturgy and the bible as foundation for his faith the difficulty still recurs as regards the liturgy he pins his faith on the civil magistrate as well as the ecclesiastic one and neither of those can claim divine inspiration as for the bible he takes both that and his prayerbook on trust from the printer who he believes made true editions from true copies so faith is at work here but faith in what faith in the priest in the magistrate in the printer editor transcriber none of whom can possibly be claimed to be divine i had the hint for this argument from cratylus its an arrow out of his quivera sharp one let me get hold of this arrow and try it out for myself suppose that your farmer hears a magistrate declare the law from the bench or suppose he reads it in a statute book do you think that the magistrate or the printer is the true and proper object of his faith and submission or do you acknowledge a higher authority on which their official actions are based again if you read a passage in the roman historian tacitus that you believe to be true would you say you assented to it on the authority of the printer or transcriber rather than the historian maybe maybe not i dont think im obliged to answer these questions all you are doing is to transfer the question from one subject to another what we were discussing was not law or nonreligious history but religious tradition and divine faith i can see well enough which way you are heading but ill never accept that you can solve one difficulty by starting up another o alciphron you expect others to stay fair and stand firm as you chose to express it on page while you pluck out their prejudices but you elude our grasp at every turn how can euphranor argue with you if not from your concessions and how can he know what they are unless you tell him my question admits of only two answers take your pick from one of the answers it will follow that by a parity of reason we can easily conceive how a man can have divine faith without ever feeling inspiration or seeing a miracle that is because it is equally possible for a mind to which divine revelation has come by some channeloral or scripturalto carry its thought and submission back up that channel to the source ending up with faith not in human but in divine authority its proper and true object being not the mechanisms and agents of the channel but rather the great origin itself from the other answer it will follow that youre introducing a general scepticism into human knowledge and smashing the hinges on which civil government and all the affairs of the world turn in short youll destroy human faith in order to get rid of divine i leave it to you to consider how well this goes with your announcement that you want to be convinced i really would be glad to be convinced one way or otherto come to some conclusion but i have so many objections in store that you shouldnt attach much weight to your dealing with one of them depend on it youll find me behaving like a gentleman and a lover of truth ill state my objections briefly and plainly and accept reasonable answers as fast as you can give them come on euphranor make the best case you can for your tradition you can never present as a constant and universal tradition one that is admitted to have been unknown or at best disputed in the church for several centuries and this is the case with the new testament for though we now have a settled canonmeaning that the church hierarchy eventually decided which books should be included in the new testament and which should noteveryone must see and admit that a tradition cant grow stronger by age and that anything that was uncertain in the earliest christian times cant be undoubted later on what do you say to this euphranor id like to get clearer about your meaning before i give an answer this objection of yours seems to presuppose that a tradition that has been constant and undisputed may be admitted as a proof but that where the tradition is defective the proof must be so too is this your meaning it is so the gospels and the epistles of st paul which were universally accepted from the start and have never since been doubted of by the church must be accepted as genuine and since these books contain all those points that are in controversy between you and me i dont need to argue with you about the authority of other books of the new testament that didnt come to be generally known and accepted in the church until later someone who assents to the undisputed books is no longer an unbeliever even if he doesnt regard the book of revelation or the epistles of st james or st jude or st peter or the last two epistles of st john as deserving to be in the canon the additional authority of these portions of the bible may carry weight in particular controversies between christians but it cant add anything to arguments against an unbeliever as such when you are a christian it will be time enough to argue about the status of those books and youll be nearer to being christian if your way there is shortened by the omission of that question for the present not as near as you may think despite all the fair and plausible things you may say about tradition when i consider the spirit of forgery that reigned in primitive times and reflect on the many gospels acts and epistles that were attributed to the apostles and then came to be recognized as spurious i confess that i cant help suspecting the whole bible tell me alciphron do you suspect that all platos writings are spurious because the dialogue on death is agreed to be so wont you accept any of ciceros writings as genuine because sigonius passed off a book that he had written as ciceros de consolatione and the deception succeeded for some time suppose i admit as genuine the works of cicero and plato that are commonly accepted as genuine what then why then i would want to know whether its balanced and impartial in a freethinker to measure the credibility nonreligious and sacred books by different standards let us know what we christians are allowed to work with when we argue with minute philosophers are we allowed the benefit of common maxims in logic and criticism if so then please give a reason why writings which in the style and manner and matter bear visible signs of being fraudulent and have accordingly been rejected by the church can be used as an argument against writings that have been universally accepted and handed down by a unanimous constant tradition i dont know of anything truly valuable that hasnt been counterfeited so your argument has a universal scope but something that tells against everything doesnt hold against anything it would seem as silly to reject the genuine writings of nonreligious authors because of the fakes as it would be unreasonable to suppose that the heretics and the many sects of christians wouldnt have included anyone capable of that kind of deceit i see no way of judging this at such a great distance of time it is all dark and doubtfulmere guesswork crito intervenes with a list of the reasons there are to trust the judgments of the church councils about what is spurious and what genuine alciphron then moves to a new point the bible is not well enough written to have been divinely inspired euphranor says that thats not decisive even an earthly monarch leaves the detailed wording of his laws and proclamations to his secretaries and clerks to express his sense in their own words also some roughness of style matches the roughness we find in largescale naturefor example there is never a really straight shorelinethough we do find geometrically exact shapes in the works of insects so it seems that a scrupulous attention to what men call the rules of art is not observed in the big productions of the author of nature alciphron replies that thats all right as regards niceties of grammar and expression but he still counts it against the divine inspiration idea that so much of the bible is written in a flat characterless boring way euphranor explodes o alciphron if i dared to follow my own judgment i would be apt to think there are noble beauties in the style of the bible in the narrative parts a simple and unaffected manner in the devotional and prophetic parts an animated and sublime style and in the doctrinal parts such an air of dignity and authority as seems to declare that their origin is divine but i shant set up my judgment on such a delicate matter against that of the wits and men of genius who are so plentiful in your sect nor am i tempted to do so because it seems to me that this latest argument of yours is worthless anyway something isnt shown not be the oracle of god by being delivered in a plain dress rather than in the enticing words of mans wisdom this may perhaps work as a defence of some simplicity and carelessness in writing but what defence can there be for nonsense crude nonsense i could easily give many examples because i once read the bible the whole way through looking for them look at the th psalm in this bible that i have here the author begins very grandly calling on all the inhabitants of the earth to listen and assuring them that his mouth will speak of wisdom and the meditation of his heart will be of understanding but he has no sooner finished this preface than he puts this senseless question wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the wickedness of my heels shall compass me about the wickedness of my heels what nonsense after such a solemn introduction i have naturally weak eyes and many things that i cant see are clearly seen by others so i dont conclude that a thing is absolutely invisible because i cant see it well it may be with my understanding the way it is with my eyes so i dont venture to declare a thing to be nonsense because i dont understand it he then goes through several interpretations that have been suggested for the passagetreating it as some kind of metaphor or as involving a hebrew idiom that we dont have in english crito chimes in with boring anecdotes about foreigners who have been misled by english idioms then euphranor resumes in this very psalm that you have picked on i should have thought that the good sense and morality contained in what follows the obscure bit would make a fairminded reader judge favorably concerning the original sense of the author in the part that he couldnt understand tell me alciphron when you are reading the classics and encounter something that you cant make sense of do you immediately conclude that it is nonsense by no means we have to expect difficulties to arise from different idioms old customs hints and allusions that may be clear at one time or place and obscure at another then why wont you judge passages of the bible by the same rule the sources of obscurity that you mention are all common both to religious and nonreligious writings and theres no doubt that in both sorts of writing the difficulties would vanish if we had a more detailed knowledge of the languages and circumstances he gives an examplea phrase in the book of jeremiah that looks odd unless one knows certain things about life near the river jordan here and there a difficult passage may be cleared up but there are many that cant be explained away by any exercise of human skill or ingenuity what do you say you about the discoveries that some of our learned writers have made of false citations from the old testament found in the new testament some new testament citations of passages in the old testament arent exactly accurate this has been known for centuries by christian writersit isnt a new discovery by minute philosophers it can be explained by errors of transcription and is of no great importance he develops this reply at some length concluding what can you infer from all this except that the design of the bible was not to give us exact knowledge of every detail and that the holy spirit didnt dictate every particle and syllable and miraculously preserve them from even the slightest alteration alciphron renews his attack on the bibles style and euphranor renews his defence then it wouldnt be a problem for me to admit that a popular incorrect style might serve the general ends of revelation as well as a more precise and exact one but i cant get over the obscurity if the supreme being had spoken to man it seems to me he would have spoken clearly and the word of god wouldnt need commentaries see qa note on page i you seem to think that obscurity is a defect but if it turns out not to be one that will be the end of this objection of yours ii now speech and style are instrumental in the conveying of thoughts and notions in getting knowledge opinion and assent iii and the perfection of an instrument should be measured by the use for which it is intended iv so something that is a defect in one instrument may be no defect in another for instance edged tools are in general designed to cut but because the uses of an axe and a razor are different its not a defect in an axe that it isnt as sharp as a razor or in the razor that it isnt as strong and heavy as an axe v so we can say in general that any instrument is perfect if it suits the purpose or intention of the person who uses it vi from which it seems to follow that no mans speech is defective in clearness if it isnt intelligible to all men but is intelligible enough to the ones the speaker intended should understand it or if it isnt equally clear in all parts or doesnt convey perfect knowledge all through but does convey an imperfect hint which is all the speaker intended vii so we need to know the intention of the speaker if we are to know whether his style is obscure through defect or design viii but no one man can possibly know all the ends and purposes of gods revelations so for all you know to the contrary the obscurity of some parts of the bible may fit quite well with a purpose that you dont know in which case they arent evidence that the bible doesnt come from god the books of the bible were written in ancient languages at distant times on various occasions and on very different subjects doesnt that make it reasonable to think that some parts or passages might have been clearly enough understood by those for whose use they were principally designed and yet seem obscure to us who speak another language and live at another time is it at all absurd or unsuitable to our ideas of god and man to suppose that god may reveal but be reserved about how much he reveals on certain remote and sublime subjects content to give us hints and glimpses rather than clear views may we not also suppose as something reasonable and suggested by the analogy of nature that some points that could have been more clearly explained were left obscure merely to encourage our diligence and modestytwo virtues which if it wouldnt seem disrespectful to such great men i would recommend to the minute philosophers lysicles replied this indeed is excellent you expect that men of sense and spirit should in great humility put out their eyes and blindly swallow all the absurdities and nonsense that are offered to them as divine revelation on the contrary i want them to open their eyes look sharply and try the spirit berkeleys phrase to see whether it is of god rather than passively and ignorantly condemning all religions together if they would compare the christian system with other claimants to divine revelation consider impartially the doctrines precepts and events contained in christianity weigh them in the balance against any other religious natural moral or historical accounts and examine diligently all the proofs internal and external that for so many ages have been able to influence and persuade so many wise learned and inquiring men they might find in christianity certain special features that sufficiently distinguish it from all other religions and supposed revelations as a basis for a reasonable faith if that happened i leave it to the minute philosophers to consider whether they are right to take a revelation so distinguished and attested and dismiss it with impatient scorn because some parts of it are obscure he returns to the topic of obscurity in texts written in an ancient foreign language the likelihood that we wont know all the idioms and so on and repeats his plea for judging religious writings in the same manner as nonreligious ones you may lecture and expound but nothing you have said or can say alters the fact that a revelation that doesnt reveal is a mere contradiction in terms tell me alciphron dont you accept that the light of the sun is the most glorious production of providence in this natural world suppose i do well this light that you cant deny was made by god shines only on the surface of things doesnt shine in the night shines imperfectly in the twilight is often interrupted refracted and obscured represents distant things and small things dubiously imperfectly or not at all isnt all this true it is doesnt it follow that to expect in this world a constant uniform light from god without any mixture of shade or mystery would be to depart from the rule and analogy of the creation and that therefore its wrong to argue that the light of revelation is not divine because its not as so clear and full as you expect or because it doesnt shine equally at all times and in all places because i claim to be fair and unbiased in this debate i have to admit that you say some plausible thingsas a man of argument will always be able to do in vindication of his prejudices but i should come into the open and tell you once for all that however much you question and answer illustrate and enlarge you wont convince me that the christian religion is divinely revealed in support of this attitude i have said several things and have many more to say that carry weight not only with myself but with many great men who are good friends of mine and they wont stop carrying weight no matter what euphranor says on the other side i envy you the happiness of knowing such people i cant have that advantage living as i do in this outoftheway place so i have to make the most of this opportunity that you and lysicles have put into my hands i regard you as two able physicians and you were pleased to consider me as a patient whom you have generously undertaken to cure now a patient must be completely free to explain his case and report all his symptoms because concealing a symptom might prevent a perfect cure so please understand me not as objecting to or arguing against either your skill or your medicines but only as reporting on my condition and on the effects your medicines have on me alciphron didnt you give me to understand that you would wipe out my prejudices it is true a good physician eradicates every fibre of the disease come you shall have a patient hearing tell me didnt plato believe that god inspired particular men as organs or trumpets to proclaim and sound forth his oracles to the world and wasnt the same opinion also embraced by other great writers of antiquity socrates seems to have thought that all true poets spoke by inspiration and cicero held that there was no extraordinary genius without it what would you infer from this i would infer that inspiration shouldnt seem impossible or absurd but rather agreeable to the light of reason and the notions of mankind youll agree with this i suppose because you have made it an objection against one particular revelation that there are so many claims to revelation throughout the world alciphron replies with a dig at the word inspire it comes he rightly says from latin meaning to breathe or blow in so it should be applied to mere wind or vapour and not to big truths euphranor sharply takes this up pointing out that alciphron is willing to say that he discourses while sitting down and yet discourse comes from latin meaning run about alciphron defends his use of discourse in the obvious way and euphranor cashes in on that may we not as well conceive that the term inspiration might be borrowed from sensible things to stand for gods action when in an extraordinary manner he influences arouses and enlightens the mind of a prophet or an apostle lets drop the silly point about blowing in and get back to our real topic when we look into our own minds it seems to me we plainly perceive certain instincts impulses and tendencies that from time to time spring up unaccountably in our souls this is ordinary and natural but why cant we conceive it possible for the human mind for an extraordinary reason to be moved in an extraordinary manner having its faculties stirred up and kicked into action by a supernatural power he admits that there have been and will be wild visions and morbid ravings but that doesnt mean that there arent also genuine inspirations we cant rule out the possibility that a true prophet or inspired person can distinguish divine inspiration from mentally unbalanced imagination as easily as we can distinguish sleeping from waking he quotes the book of jeremiah to that effect i see no need to deny that inspirations and revelations are possible make the best you can of this concession well if something is allowed as possible we are entitled to suppose that it is fact we are let us then suppose that god chose to make a revelation to men and that he inspired some men as a means to instruct others having supposed this can you deny that their inspired discourses and revelations might have been committed to writing or that the written versions might in the course of time become obscure in many places that some of them might even have been less clear than others at the outset or that they might get altered by frequent transcribing as other writings are known to have done isnt it even very probable that all these things would happen i grant it well then how can you defend your claim that the bible is not divine because of facts about it that you now acknowledge would probably accompany any divine revelation transmitted down to us through so many centuries he concedes the point about small blemishes that might arise from copying errors etc but i defy the wit of man to invent anything more extravagant than the accounts the bible gives of apparitions devils miracles god manifest in the flesh being born again grace selfdenial resurrection of the dead and suchlike sick dreamsthings so odd unaccountable and remote from human understanding that you have no more chance of clearing them of the charge of absurdity than you have of making a black man white by washing him no critical skill can justify them no tradition can recommend themeven as inventions of competent men let alone as divine revelations i always had a great opinion of your wisdom alciphron but now i consider you as something more than man how otherwise could you know what it may be proper for god to reveal this is of course a sneer i dont think it is insulting to the greatest of human understandings to suppose that they are ignorant of many things that arent suited to their faculties or lie out of their reach even the plans of princes often lie beyond the ken of their subjects who can only know what is revealed to them by those at the helm and are often unqualified to judge concerning the usefulness and likely consequences even of what they are allowed to know until in due course the scheme unfolds and is explained by the course of events of course many things contained in the bible are remote from the common understanding of mankind but i dont see that it follows from this that they didnt come from divine revelation on the contrary doesnt it seem reasonable to suppose that a revelation from god would contain something different in kind or more excellent in degree than anything that lies within the grasp of humans even of the wisest philosopher accounts of separate spirits good or bad prophecies miracles etc are undoubtedly strange but i dont see how you can prove them to be impossible or absurd some things are so evidently absurd that it would be almost as silly to disprove them as to believe them and i take thesethe ones i listed a moment agoto be of that sort isnt it possible that some men show as much prejudice and narrowness in rejecting all such accounts as others might show slackness and credulity in accepting them i cant understand why anyone who admits the union of the soul with the body should declare it impossible for the human nature to be united to the divine in some way that cant be described or grasped by reason nor can i see any absurdity in the idea that sinful man may be born again may become a new creature by the grace of god reclaiming him from a carnal life to a spiritual life of virtue and holiness and since being governed by sense and appetite is contrary to the happiness and perfection of a rational creature i dont in the least wonder that we are told to exercise selfdenial as for the resurrection of the dead i dont regard that as so very contrary to the analogy of nature when i see plants that have been left to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigour or a worm that appears to be dead change its nature so that something that at first crawled on the earth becomes a new species and flies around with wings and when i consider that the soul and body are things of such utterly different kinds i cant see any reason to be positive that the soul must necessarily be extinguished when the body falls to pieces especially since i find in myself a strong natural desire for immortality and i havent observed that natural appetites are given in vain given merely to be frustrated you regard certain things as extravagant and absurd but i shant agree with that until i see good reason for it no alciphron your positive airs mustnt be regarded as proofs and we wont think things are contrary to common sense just because you say so by common sense we ought to mean either the general sense of mankind or the improved reason of thinking men now i believe that all those articles you have so powerfully and vividly summed up and exploded can be shown to be consistent with and even in harmony with common sense in one or other of these senses that the gods might appear and converse among men and that the divinity might inhabit human nature were things that the heathens believed and though the notion of a devil may not be so obvious or so fully described there are plain traces of it in several traditions he cites ancient greeks chaldeans and egyptians and reports that a text as early as homer contains something that cardinal bessarion has identified as an allusion to the fall of satan then many more classical references in connection with the other articles on alciphrons list apparently with grace uppermost though it isnt mentioned by name winding up any man who really thinks has only to look at what other thinking men have thoughtmen who cant be supposed to be prejudiced in favour of revealed religionand hell see cause if not to think with reverence of the christian doctrines of grace selfdenial rebirth sanctification and the rest at least to judge more modestly and cautiously than someone who confidently declares them absurd and in conflict with the reason of mankind lysicles says that none of this has the slightest appeal him and that if this makes anyone think he is ignorant i am happy and safe in my ignorance crito says perhaps not so safe which he and backs up thus mere ignorance isnt a crime but willful ignorance deliberate ignorance ignorance from laziness or conceited ignorance is a faultwe have the testimony of heathen writers as proof of that and it doesnt need proof to show that if ignorance is a fault then we cant be secure in ignorance as an excuse honest crito seems to hint that man should take care to inform himself while alive so that his neglect to do so wont be punished when he is dead the best way to get a gentleman to keep on with something is to try to frighten him out of it this is the stale and absurd tactic that priests use making them and their religion more odious and contemptible to me than all the other items put together that hellandeternalpunishment thing is the most absurd as well as the nastiest thought that ever entered into the head of mortal man but you must admit that it isnt an exclusively christian absurdity because socrates that great freethinker of athens thought it probable that impious men are punished for ever in hell it is reported of this same socrates that he was often known to think for twentyfour hours at a stretch fixed in the same position and wrapped up in meditation our modern freethinkers are men of a more lively sort those old philosophers were most of them insecure i think they had a narrow timid way of thinking that falls far short of the frank spirit of our times but if a man doesnt know the nature of the soul how can reason give him any assurance about whether it is mortal or immortal but what if i do know the nature of the soul i have been taught that whole secret by a modern freethinker a man of science who discovered the nature of the soul not by a tiresome looking into himself or by getting himself confused in a labyrinth of notions or by stupidly thinking for whole days and nights together but by looking into things and observing the analogy of nature this great man is a tried and tested scientist who has conducted many experiments on plants he holds that men and plants are really of the same species that animals are moving plants and plants are fixed animals that the mouths of animals have the same use as the roots of plants that blossoms and flowers correspond to the private parts of the human body that plant and animal bodies are both organic and both have life which is a certain motion and circulation of juices through the appropriate tubes or vessels the soul he says is the specific form or source from which come the distinct qualities or properties of things we start with plants because they are simpler than animals and thus easier to analyse the soul of any plantrosemary for exampleis nothing more or less than its essential oil this is the source of its special fragrance taste and medicinal virtuesie its life and operations use chemical techniques to separate or extract this essential oil and you get the soul of the plant whats left behind being a dead carcass that doesnt have a single property or power of the plant this essential oil is an oily substance with a fine subtle element or volatile salt imprisoned in it strictly speaking this volatile salt is the essence of the plants soul containing all its powers and the oil is the vehicle of this most subtle part of the soul the part that fixes and individuates it and just as the plant dies when separated from this oil so the soul dies when this essential oil is split up into its elements as you can see by leaving it exposed for some time to the open air so that the volatile salt or spirit can fly off after which the oil remains dead and tasteless not perceptibly weighing any less but having lost that volatile essence of the soul that ethereal aura that spark of existence which returns and mixes with the solar light the universal soul of the world and the only source of life im talking about all lifeof plants lower animals and thinking animals which differ only according to the fineness of organization of their bodies this chemical system lets you at once into the nature of the soul and accounts for all its phenomena in the compound that is called man the soul or essential oil is what commonly goes by the name of animal spirit see note on page for chemists do now agree that animal spirits are nothing but the more subtle oils now in proportion as the essential oil of the plant we call man is more subtle than that of other plants the volatile salt that impregnates it is more free to act and that explains the properties and actions of humans that distinguish them from lower creatures he gives some examples o lysicles your ingenious friend has opened up a new scene and explained the most obscure and difficult points in the clearest and easiest manner this account of things struck my fancy i must admit im no great lover of creeds or systems but when a notion is reasonable and based on experience i know how to value it really seriously lysicles do you believe this account to be true in the next exchange the artist and his art mean roughly the expert and the field in which he is an expert really seriously i dont know whether i do or not but i can assure you that the ingenious artist himself hasnt the least doubt about it and believe an artist in his art is a sound bit of advice and a short way to knowledge but what does the soul of man have to do with the chemical art the same reason that tells me to trust a skillful artist in his art inclines me to suspect him when he is out of his art men are too apt to reduce unknown things to the standard of what they know and bring a prejudice or slant from things they have been familiar with in making judgments about things with which they have not been familiar i have known a violinist solemnly teach that the soul is harmony a geometrician very positive that the soul must be extended and a physician who having pickled half a dozen embryos and dissected a few rats and frogs became very sure of himself and affirmed that there is no soul at all lysicles declines to argue saying in effect theres the theory take it or leave it which euphranor ironically describes as said like a gentleman then he asks whether the maxim about believing an artist in his art applies to clergymen lysicles says no why not because he lysicles knows as much about religious matters as the clergy do all men of good sense are competent judges of those matters what are gods attributes and his treatment of mankind the true end and happiness of rational creatures and the means of improving and perfecting their beingsare these more easy and obvious matters than the ones to which ordinary secular studies are devoted perhaps not but i do know thissome things are so obviously absurd that no authority will make me give in to them for instance if all mankind tried to convince me that the son of god was born on earth in a poor family was spat upon beaten and crucified lived like a beggar and died like a thief i wouldnt believe a word of it common sense shows everyone how an earthly prince or ambassador can decently appear and the son of god coming as an ambassador from heaven must make an appearance that is much greater than that and is in all respects the very reverse of that which jesus christ is reportedeven by his own historiansto have made do you think lysicles that if a man entered london in a rich suit of clothes with a hundred gilt coaches and a thousand laced footmen this would be a more divine and truly grand appearance than if he had power with a word to heal all kinds of diseases to raise the dead to life and calm storms at sea oh im sure it is very agreeable to common sense to suppose that he could restore others to life but couldnt save his own you tell us of course that he rose again from the dead but what was the point of his dying in the first placethe just dying for the unjust the son of god dying for wicked men and why precisely there why exactly then why didnt he appear earlier and preach in all parts of the world so that the benefit was spread wider and more evenly account for all these points and reconcile them if you can to the common notions and plain sense of mankind crito replies with two points one is that some of lysicles questions are boorish and illmannered benevolent acts arent usually scrutinized as carefully as other acts who but a minute philosopher would on a gratuitous distribution of favours ask why now rather than earlier lysicles should face the fact that he is out of his depth none of us know nearly enough to be entitled to form judgments on what it would have been reasonable for god to do there are several pages of this you cant judge the parts of a machine without knowing how the whole thing works lysicles says that some things can be seen at first glance to be so cruel and unjust that they are obviously unworthy of god to which crito replies that we should take into account à propos of how badly god treated the egyptians how badly the egyptians had treated the israelites and also repeated that caution in judgment is appropriate when we know that we dont have all the facts euphranor has a qa argument making the point that children often dont understandand may even resentactions by their parents that are entirely for their own good he likens this to lysicles attitude to actions by god the topic of the ancients versus the freethinking moderns comes up again in the course of it alciphron says that the present times gray and hoary with age and experience have a manifest advantage over those that are falsely called ancient the point being that in ancient times the world was younger than it is now he continues i tell you in plain english euphranor we dont want your revelations for this plain reason those that are clear were already known to everyone and noone gets any benefit from those that are obscure just as its impossible for anyone to believe the practical principles of the christian religion and not be the better for them so it is obvious that those principles may be much more easily taught as articles of faith than demonstrated or discovered as doctrines of science here highgrade theoretical knowledge we see all the time that many are instructed in matters of faith few are taught by scientific demonstration and fewer still can discover truth for themselves i wish that minute philosophers would reflect on some facts relating to the natural or civil concerns of the world with religion not coming into it namely how rarely men are swayed or governed by mere reasoning and how often by faith how little they know and how much they believe how uncommon it is to meet with a man who argues soundly who really is a master of reason or walks by that rule how much better qualified men are to judge concerning facts than concerning reasonings to receive truth on testimony than to deduce it from principles how general a spirit of trust or reliance runs through the whole system of life and opinion and at the same time how seldom the dry light of unprejudiced nature is followed or to be found if our thinking men would only give thought to these things they might find it hard to produce a good reason why faith which has so great a share in everything else should have no place in religion re dry light see note on page he then replies to the were already known to everyone part of what alciphron has just said by saying that obviously they werent perhaps they could have been known but revelation is useful if it reveals something that men havent taken the trouble to know even if they could have known it alciphron then moves to a complaint against prophecies namely that they are very obscure euphranor replies that some are obscure while some are not which is pretty much what should be expected given the way the world is and the way men are alciphron in reply refers to the scepticism about prophecies of freethinking experts on these matter and euphranor responds to that somewhat sneeringly and remarks that the christians have their experts too after a further exchange of insults euphranor offers some explanations of why certain prophecies are unclearto us at this time looking back in time we can see a certain progress from darker to lighter in religious matters so we can reasonably expect that future events will clear up such points as at present exercise the faith of believers alciphron now drops prophecies and turns to something else i want now to examine your religion by comparing the system of revelation with collateral accounts of ancient heathen writers and showing how much it clashes with them the christian revelation presupposes the jewish religion so if the jewish one is destroyed the christian one must of course fall to the ground with it i am going to go the short way by attacking this jewish revelation headon tell me if we believe the mosaic account of things ie the first five books of the old testament dont we have to hold that the world was created not quite six thousand years ago yes we do what will you say now if other ancient records carry the history of the world back many thousand years beyond this period what if the egyptians and chinese have accounts extending to thirty or forty thousand years what if the egyptians have observed twelve hundred eclipses during the space of fortyeight thousand years what if the chinese have also many observations antecedent to the jewish account of the creation what if the chaldeans had been observing the stars for more than four hundred thousand years and what shall we say if we have successions of kings and their reigns marked for several thousand years before the beginning of the world assigned by moses shall we reject the accounts and records of all other nationsthe most famous ancient and learned in the worldand preserve a blind reverence for moses the legislator of the jews if they deserve to be rejected euphranor replies why shouldnt we reject them this introduces an attack on the accounts and records that alciphron has mentioned the only reliable ones dont go as far back as moses time for the beginning of the world the writers of the records that stretch further back are unknown or unregarded by ancient astronomers modern scholars have uncovered inconsistencies in the chinese accounts alciphron remarks that the modern scholars in question are mostly roman catholic missionaries and euphranor replies that they are our only source of information about the chinese and that in any case it makes sense to trust them the same persons who tell us of these accounts refute them if we reject their authority in one case what right have we to build upon it in another alciphron praises the chinese generally as a learned able and acute people who are addicted to arts and sciences euphranor replies at length that on the contrary the chinese are superstitious credulous and absurd then he turns to the egyptian records purporting to make the world older than moses did and gets alciphron to admit that he doesnt know where those records were found when they were written how they were preserved and so on they arent mentioned by any ancient greek writers though some of them visited egypt euphranor comments again at even greater length on the credulity of any modern person like alciphron who believes such stuff alciphron replies with a challenge how can you account for the work that the great joseph scaliger and sir john marsham have put in on those records euphranor declines to account for it and deplores the fact that such substantial scholars as scaliger and marsham should waste time on that rubbishy stuff after all its hard to see why those egyptian priests should have set up spurious records supporting such great claims to antiquityrecords that differ one from another but are alike in one thing namely that they overthrow moses history how can this be accounted for if there was no real foundation for the records what pleasure profit or power could motivate men to forge successions of ancient names and periods of time for ages before the world began really alciphron is there anything so strange or unprecedented in this empty wish to extend the antiquity of nations beyond the truth hasnt it been seen in most parts of the world doesnt it appear even in our own times especially among dependent and subdued people who have little else to boast of he then launches into masses of detail first about the irish and then about the sicilians these being dependent and subdued people who invented long histories for themselves as a way of feeling important then why isnt it likely that the egyptians a subdued people invented fabulous accounts from the same motive and like others valued themselves because of extravagant claims to antiquity when in all other respects they were so much inferior to their masters and it is no less certain that the phœnicians assyrians and chaldeans were each a conquered and reduced people before the rest of the world appear to have heard anything of their claims to such remote antiquity but what need is there to work at accounting for the motivations of fabulous writers isnt it sufficient to see that they relate absurdities arent supported by any independent evidence seem not to have been believed even by their own countrymen and are inconsistent one with another theres nothing strange in the fact that men should have the stupidity to create false accounts so as to deceive the world what is strange is the fact that after so many learned critics have done so much towards undeceiving the world there should still be men who are capable of being taken in by the paltry scraps of fabulous or counterfeit writers let me point out that those learned critics may prove to be clergymen perhaps some of them roman catholics what about sir isaac newton was he either catholic or clergyman you may not grant that he was as wise and intellectually powerful as the great men of the minute philosophy but it you cant deny that he had read and thought a great deal on this subject ending his inquiry with a perfect contempt for all those celebrated rivals to moses it has been observed by able men that sir isaac newton though a layman was deeply prejudicedas we can from his great regard for the bible and the same holds for mr locke mr boyle lord bacon and other famous laymen who however knowledgeable on some matters cant be thought to have achieved the keen discernment that is the special distinction of your sect but perhaps there are reasons other than prejudice to incline a man to give moses the preference the government manners and religion of his country were based on the truth of his history there are clear traces of that history in the most ancient books and traditions of the gentiles particularly of the brahmins and parsees his account of the great flood is confirmed by signs in nature as well as by writings of antiquity his history is confirmed by the relatively recent invention of arts and sciences the gradual peopling of the world the very names of ancient nations and even by the authority and arguments of that renowned philosopher lucretius who is so much admired and followed by the freethinkers when he writes on other subjects the continual decrease of fluids the sinking of hills and the slowing of planetary motion provide natural evidence that this world had a beginning just as the civil or historical proofs that i have mentioned plainly indicate that this beginning occurred at about the time assigned to it in the bible and after all that let me add one more remark people digging into the earth have found quantities of shells and in some places bones and horns of animals complete and unbroken that have probably lain there for thousands of years that makes it seem probable that gems medals and metal or stone implements might have remained buried complete and unbroken for forty or fifty thousand years if the world had been that old so how does it come about that no such remains are found no remnants of all those centuries preceding the biblical account of time no fragments of buildings no public monuments no intaglios cameos statues reliefs medals inscriptions utensils or manufactured things of any kind are ever discovered to testify to the existence of those mighty empires those successions of monarchs heroes and demigods for so many thousand years let us look forward in time and think about a time twenty thousand years into the future with the intervening time having involved plagues famines wars and earthquakes all of which will have made great havoc in the world isnt it highly probable that pillars vases and statues that now exist would still exist at that future time and testify to our time and all the time between now and then im thinking of pillars etc made of granite porphyry or jasperstones that are so hard that we know them to have lasted for two thousand years above ground without any considerable alteration isnt it also probable that some of our current coins might be dug up at that time far in the future or that old walls and the foundations of buildings might show themselves just as the shells and stones of the primeval world are preserved down to our times these are matters that anyone can form a judgment about using common sense and ordinary experience they give us good reason to conclude that the world was created at about the time recorded in the bible alciphron sat musing and made no answer whereupon lysicles spoke up harking back to critos remark that lucretius supported the mosaic dating of the start of the world i must admit that i would rather suppose with lucretius that the world was made by chance and that men grew out of the earth like pumpkins than pin my faith on those wretched fablespinning fragments of oriental history that alciphron had used as evidence against moses dating of the start of that world as for the learned men who have taken pains to clarify them and piece them together they strike me as being no better than so many musty pedants an able freethinker may now and then make some use of their laborious output and play off one absurdity against anothereg an egyptian absurdity against a jewish one but dont infer from this that he has any real respect for the authority of such apocryphal writers or believes one syllable of the chinese babylonian or egyptian traditions if we seem to give them preference over the bible thats only because they are not established by law this is my plain sense of the matter and i dare say its the general sense of our sect they are too rational to take such trifles seriously though they sometimes give hints of deep learning and put on a grave face just to have fun at the expense of bigots since lysicles will have it so i am content not to build on accounts of time preceding the mosaic he then talks about historians of about moses own time they should be regarded as on a par with moses he says and some of them give accounts that utterly clash with hiseg one that says that the jews were really egyptians who had leprosy and were driven out of the country for that reason on this account the religion that they said had been given to them on mount sinai was really something which they as egyptians brought with them from egypt crito replies that those other accounts arent evidence against the mosaic one because they are in such conflict with one another and that linguistic considerations show that the jews werent egyptians and that a religion whose fundamental principle was monotheism and whose principal design was to abolish idolatry couldnt have come from egypt the most idolatrous of all nations after some more of this alciphron deplores the loss of the books of those great men celsus porphyry and julian books that would have enabled the modern freethinkers to demolish the whole jewish religious system at once crito questions that and says some slighting things about each of the three especially emphasizing how credulous they were accepting all sorts of weird beliefs they were he concludes whimsical superstitious weak and visionaryand he throws in a final gibe against the impartial gentlemen who admire the talents and are proud to tread in the footsteps of those three men see things in different lights something that one person wonders at is regarded as negligible by another it can even happen that a prejudiced mind whose attention is turned towards things faults and blemishes fancies it sees some shadow of defect in the great lights that have in our own days enlightened the world but tell me crito what you think of the jewish historian josephus he is agreed to have been a man of learning and judgment he did himself accept a revealed religion namely judaism and christians commonly cite him with respect when his authority suits their purposes all this i accept then mustnt it seem suspicious to any impartial inquirer that this learned jew should write the history of his own country focusing on the very place and time of jesus christs appearance without saying anything about the character miracles and doctrine of that extraordinary person some ancient christians were so sensitive about this that they tried to repair the situation by inserting a famous passage in the work of that historiana forgery that has been sufficiently detected by able modern critics well there is expert opinion on both sides of that question but i dont want to get into all that so i am content to take it your way by supposing that the passage is not genuine but is the pious fraud of some wrongheaded christian who couldnt tolerate the omission in josephus but that fraud cant make the omission a real objection against christianity and i cant see in the omission any other basis for amazement or suspicion supposing the gospel account to have exactly true it would seem very natural for josephus not to have reported it given that he was aiming by his work to give his country some standing in the eyes of the world which had been greatly prejudiced against the jews and knew little of their historya purpose that the life and death of our saviour wouldnt have contributed to even slightly josephus couldnt have been an eyewitness of our saviour or his miracles he was a highclass pharisee who was learned in foreign as well as jewish scholarship with a high position in the state whereas the gospel was preached to the poor the gospel was initially accepted and then spread by poor illiterate people chosen for this role so that the gospels spread wouldnt seem to be the work of man or a product of human selfinterest or power the jews generally expected the messiah to be a worldly and conquering princea prejudice that was so strong that they preferred attributing our saviours miracles to the devil to acknowledging him to be the messiah at josephuss time the jewish state was in a condition of hellish disorder and confusion with mens minds filled and stunned by unparalleled wars dissensions massacres and seditions of that devoted people taking all these facts together i dont find it strange that such a man who was writing with that view at that time and in those circumstances should omit to describe our blessed saviours life and death or to mention his miracles or to pay any attention to the state of the christian church which at that time was like a tiny seed just beginning to take root and germinate and this will seem even less strange if you bear in mind that the apostles in a few years after our saviours death left jerusalem set about convert nonjews and were dispersed throughout the world the converts in jerusalem were not only some of the poorest people but were also few in number the three thousand converts added to the church in one day when peter preached in jerusalem seem to have been strangers from all over the country who had gathered there to celebrate the feast of pentecost throughout the time of josephus and for several years more during a succession of fifteen bishops the christians at jerusalem conformed to the laws of moses which made them in outward appearance just like the rest of the jews which must have made them harder to notice the gospel when first propagated seemed to ignore the great or considerable men of this world would it be surprising if they in turn overlooked it as something not suited to their way of thinking he goes on to say that learned jews at that time might well be afraid in one way of writing in favour of christianity and in another way of writing against it so that their safest course was to say nothing about it also the historian gamaliel does mention jesus christ in passing in his account of st jamess death although he shows a respect for the apostle he mentions jesus in a casual and neutral way saying nothing either good or bad about him but he characterizes him as jesus who was called the christ not who claimed to be the christ or who was falsely called the christ but simply and then he says it again this time in greek he continues it is evident that josephus knew there was such a man as jesus and that he was said to be the christ and yet he condemns neither him nor his followers which i see as evidence in their favour if josephus had known or been convinced that jesus was an impostor of course he would have said so plainly i cant understand why any man should conclude against the truth of the gospel from josephuss omitting to speak of it any more than from his omitting to accept it if the first christians been chief priests and rulers or men of science and learning it might have been more plausible to contend that their religion was a human construct than it is in fact given that it has pleased god to use weak things to confound the strong yet it seems an odd argument in support of any doctrine that it was preached by simple people to simple people it would indeed be a very weak argument if the only testimony to the doctrine came from simple people but what we have here is a doctrine of which this is true its first instruments were people with very few human advantages it made its first progress among people who didnt have wealth skills or power to grace or encourage it in a short time through its own innate excellence and the mighty force of miracles and the demonstration of the holy spirit it spread throughout the world and subdued men of all ranks and conditions of life doing this not only with no support from all worldly motives but positively against such motives isnt it very unreasonable to reject or suspect such a doctrine on the grounds that its human means are lowly mightnt this with much better reason be thought to be evidence that the doctrine comes from god alciphron replies that real inquirers will demand testimony from learned men there has been plenty of that but their testimony is suspect because they were prejudiced christians and therefore their testimony is to be suspected you are demanding evidence of the truth of christianity from people who didnt believe it this isnt reasonable they kick this topic around for a while and then a dispute starts up concerning how much respect the early church fathers deserve alciphron says that even if he did give weight to early christian writings the great number of forgeries and heresies that sprung up in those times would considerably take away from that weight let us suppose something that you do agree to be possible namely that there is a god a devil and a revelation from heaven that was committed to writing many centuries ago on the basis of that supposition take a look at human nature and ask what would probably follow if the supposition were fact isnt it very likely there would be halfbelievers mistaken bigots holy frauds men who were ambitious selfinterested disputing conceited schismatic heretical absurd among those who announced themselves as believers in this revealed religion and isnt it also very likely that after a few centuries there would be various readings omissions transpositions and obscurities in the text of the sacred oracles you be the judge is it reasonable to treat as an objection to something a course of events that would probably and naturally follow if the thing in question did exist well say what you will this variety of opinions must shake the faith of a reasonable man where there are so many different opinions on the same point its very certain that they cant all be true but its certain that they can all be false and the means we have to use to find out the truth when a man of sense embarks on this inquiry he finds himself suddenly startled and thrown offbalance by hard words and knotty questions this makes him abandon the pursuit thinking the game not worth the chase crito replies that differences of opinion and the formation of sects occurs in all branches of human studyhe cites law medicine and politicsand this doesnt deter us from thinking that there are good rules sound ideas and useful truths in all those disciplines he develops this approach in connection with medicine remarking that real discoveries have been made despite the hard words and knotty questions that have arisen on the way to them then after a brief exchange of insults crito turns to the question of schisms and subsects but to return what profession of men is there who never split into schisms and never talk nonsense isnt it obvious that out of all the kinds of knowledge on which the human mind is employed there grow certain excrescences that can safely be pared off as we pare our fingernails under all that rubbishy stuff it is certain that the faith derived from christ and his apostles was not a piece of empty sophistry and to claim to demolish the foundation of faith for the sake of the superstructure that humans have built is a sign of poor thinking and its a sign of unfairness to suppose that a doubtful sense is fixed and argue from one side of the question in disputed points such questions as should the beginning of genesis be understood in a literal or an allegorical sense is the book of job a history or a parable are disputed amongst christians so an unbeliever has no right to argue from one side of any of them what we are arguing for now is not this or that tenet of a sect this or that controversial idea but rather the general faith taught by christ and his apostles and preserved by universal and perpetual tradition in all the churches down to our own times to attack this divine doctrine on account of things that come not from within the doctrine but from external sources such as the theories and disputes of men strikes me as an absurdity comparable with cutting down a fine tree that provides fruit and shade because its leaves give nourishment to caterpillars or because spiders sometimes weave cobwebs among the branches after an exchange focussing on the question of how clever men ought to spend their time but after all the examination and inquiry that mortal man can make about revealed religion it is impossible to reach any rational sure footing we are told strange things that are said to be proved by the fact that men have laid down their lives for them but it is perfectly conceivableindeed it has often happenedthat men have died for the sake of false beliefs that they used to hold you may indeed find examples of men dying for falsehoods that they believed but can you find a case of a mans dying for the sake of a proposition that he didnt believe of course not it is inconceivable yet this must be what happened if the witnesses of christs miracles and resurrection were impostors there is indeed a great deal of glittery talk about faith based on miracles but when i examine this matter thoroughly and track the christian faith back to its origins i find that it is really based on darkness and hesitation and uncertainty instead of propositions that are evident or at least agreeable to human reason i find an astonishing narrative of the son of god tempted in the wilderness by the devilsomething utterly unexplainable having absolutely no purpose or use or reason i meet with strange stories of angels appearing voices from heaven demonsthings quite out of line with common sense and common experiencealong with a number of incredible feats said to have been done by divine power but more probably the inventions of men and not made less likely to be so by my complete inability to guess why they were invented deeply laid plans are dark and the less we know the more we suspect but even if all those stories are true i shant accept that they were miraculous until i have a thorough knowledge of ordinary natural causes and of the force of magic it seems to me alciphron that what you are analysing is not faith but infidelity lack of faith and that you are tracing it back to its sources which judging from your own account i understand to be dark and doubtful worries and surmises hastiness in judging and narrowness in thinking and all this is based on your fantastic overrating of your own scrap of experience and on real ignorance of the views of god and of the qualities operations and interrelations of the many fundamentally different kinds of beings that exist in the universe or that you dont know dont exist thats what the sources of unbelief are likeobscure uncertain fanciful and conjectural whereas the sources of faith are propositions that seem to me plain and clear there is nothing unclear about these this faith in christ was spread throughout the world soon after his death that wasnt brought about by human learning politics or power in the churchs early years many knowledgeable and honest men accepted this faith not from some but against all worldly motives the nearer those men were to the fountainhead of christianity the better chance they had to check on the truth of the propositions that they believed the less it was in their selfinterest to be persuaded the more need there was for evidence to convince them they relied on the authority of people who declared themselves eyewitnesses of the miracles and resurrection of christ those professed eyewitnesses suffered greatly through giving this testimony and finally they sealed it with their blood those witnesses weak and unimportant as they were overcame the worldspread more light preached purer morals and did more benefit to mankind than all the philosophers and wise men put together if these propositions are clear and sure as they seem to me to be they constitute plain just and reasonable grounds for assent to the christian faith they dont rest on any falsehoods they dont contain anything beyond our sphere because they dont presuppose more knowledge than we have or better faculties than we are actually equipped with and even if they arent accepted as morally certain as i think they will be by fair and unprejudiced inquirers even accepting them as only probable is sufficient to stop the mouth of an unbeliever morally certain means certain enough for all practical purposes its a bit vague but is stronger than only probable the pillars of our faith are the above eight plain propositions and not the obscure ones that you supposed which are in fact the unsound uncertain sources of unbelief in a rash prejudiced and assuming mind to argue or counterargue on the basis that a supposed miracle might be explained by hidden powers of nature or by magic is groping in the dark but by the evident light of their senses men can be sure enough about perceptible effects and matters of fact such as the miracles and the resurrection of christ and the testimony of such men can be passed on through centuries with the same moral certainty as can other historical narrations and those same miraculous facts when reason has related them to the doctrines they were brought to prove provide an unbiased mind with strong indications that they have come from god or from a superior source as for the fact that jews and gentiles back then attributed our saviours miracles to magicdo you count that as evidence against the miracles it seems to be to be positive evidence that those events did occur it doesnt square with the christian account of what caused them but it doesnt bring any evidence against that account as for the nature and operations of demons the history laws and system of rational beings and gods schemes or viewswe dont claim to know enough about all this to account for every action and appearance recorded in the gospel but you dont know enough of those things to be entitled to object against accounts that are so well supported by testimony its easy to raise doubts regarding many authentic parts of civil historyevents that we find inexplicable because the explanation of them requires more knowledge than we have of facts circumstances and councils and its even easier with respect to natural history in that field if surmises were accepted as evidence against things that are odd strange and inexplicable if our slight experience were made the rule and measure of truth and no phenomenon was accepted unless we with our ignorance of the principles laws and system of nature could explain it we would make discoveries all rightdiscoveries about our own blindness and presumption something that i cant begin to explain by any rules of logic and good sense is why men who are so easily and so often floored by problems about the natural visible world should yet be so sharpsighted and dogmatic about the invisible world and its mysteries i expect that ill always be in the darkas you put itabout the evidence for the christian religion and always presume there isnt any for how is it possible at this remote distance in time to arrive at any knowledge or conduct any demonstrations about it what of it i admit that knowledge in a strict sense cant be had except of something that is either selfevident or demonstrated but probable arguments are a sufficient basis for faith who ever thought that rigorous proofs are necessary to make a christian all that is needed is faith and provided that men are convinced in the main and on the whole this saving faith can be consistent with some degrees of obscurity doubt and error for although the light of truth is unchangeable in its eternal source the father of lights in relation to us it is variously weakened and obscured by passing across a long distance or through a thick medium in which it is intercepted distorted or tinted by mens prejudices and passions but despite all this if you will use your eyes you can see enough for the purposes either of nature or of grace although the light you see by is dimmer or brighter depending on the place the distance the time of day and the medium and although there may be much that we cant explain in the realms of nature and of grace all that is required for faith to be maintained is that the two should exhibit enough analogy to make it probable that they have the same author are the workmanship of one and the same hand those who saw touched and handled jesus christ after his resurrection if anyone did may be said to have seen by a clear light but to us the light is very dim and yet we are expected to believe in the resurrection just as they did for my part i agree with spinoza that christs death was literal but his resurrection was allegorical and for my part i cant see anything in this celebrated unbeliever that should make me desert matters of fact and moral evidence so as to adopt his ideas throughout this paragraph evidence means evidentness in this usage the evidence of proposition p refers to how evident p is its not about evidence for p so matters of fact and moral evidence means matters of fact and propositions that are morally evident re morally see the note on page i do have to allow a certain allegorical resurrection i mean the resurrection of christs disciples from weakness to resolution from fear to courage from despair to hope and that allegorical resurrection is evidence for the real one because i cant see how those changes in the disciples can be explained except by supposing that they knew through their own senses that our lord had truly really literally risen from the dead it cant be denied that his disciples who were eyewitnesses of his miracles and resurrection had stronger evidence than we can have of those matters but it also cant be denied that at that time there was a correspondingly greater need for evidence to induce men to embrace a new institution that was contrary to the whole system of their upbringing their prejudices their passions their interests and every human motive still it seems to me that the moral evidence and probable arguments that are within our reach are quite enough to make prudent thinking men keep to the faith that has been handed down to us from our ancestors and established by the laws of our countrya faith requiring submission on matters that are above our knowledge and for the rest recommending doctrines that best fit our interests and our reason he goes on to talk about the advantage that we have of being able to look back at the history of the world during the christian period and seeing gods plans a work in it then we can behold christ crucified that stumblingblock to the jews and foolishness to the greeks putting an end to the temple worship of the one and the idolatry of the other but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness corinthians if a due reflection on these things isnt enough to create a reverence for the christian faith in the minds of men why would that be because men have a wise and cautious incredulity anything but that consider how easily men have faith during their daily doings where there is no prejudice or appetite to bias or disturb their natural judgment the men who in matters of religion wont move an inch unless things are made evident to them and at every turn expect demonstration trust their health to a physician and their lives to a sailor with complete faith i cant think they deserve the honour of being thought harder to convince than other men or that they are more accustomed to know and therefore less inclined to believe on the contrary its tempting to suspect that our modern unbelief owes more to ignorance than to knowledge this leads to squabbles with lysicles about attitudes to careful scholarship and then about the legitimacy of attacking christianity by jokes and puns and innuendo euphranor joins in on that last topic and so finally does although i am a declared admirer of reason a worshipper of reason i have to admit that in some cases the sharpness of ridicule can do more than the strength of argument but if freethinkers sometimes use mirth and humour its not because we have no other weapons it shall never be said that a freethinker was afraid of reasoning no crito we have reasons in store the best are yet to come and if we can find an hour for another conversation before lysicles and i set out for london tomorrow morning ill undertake to supply you with reasons that are as clear effective and close to the point as you could wish seventh dialogue tuesday we assembled at break of day in the library alciphron began with a declaration of his sincerity assuring us he had very maturely and with a most unbiased mind considered everything that had been said the day before he added that a number of probable reasons had been given for accepting the christian faith but he said because those reasons are only probable they cant overcome absolute certainty and demonstration so if i can demonstrate rigorously prove that your religion is absurd and inconsistent your probable arguments in defence of it instantly lose their force and with it all right to be answered or considered when sincere and able witnesses give the same testimony that certainly has great weight in human affairs it can even have enough weight to claim our acceptance of things that are odd and out of line with human judgment and or experience i will also concede that it is possible for a traditionie a chain of testimoniesto be conveyed with moral evidence see note on page through many centuries but you must concede that something thats demonstrably and obviously false shouldnt be accepted on the strength of any testimony whatever because however good testimony is it cant amount to demonstration to be plain no testimony can turn nonsense into sense no moral evidence can make contradictions consistent well then because the strength of our cause doesnt depend on critical points of history chronology or languages it cant be decided by any such points dont be surprised if the same kind of tradition that governs our assent with respect to facts in civil or natural history is not accepted as sufficient support for metaphysical absurdities and absolute impossibilities things that are obscure and unaccountable in human affairs or the operations of nature may nevertheless be possible and if the testimony to them is good enough they may be assented to but religious assent or faith can be plainly shown to be intrinsically impracticable impossible and absurd this is the primary reason for unbelief this is our citadel and fortress it may indeed be ornamented with extra turrets and supplementary walls of learnedness of various sorts but if those are demolished the fortress still stands its own strength makes it impregnable well i have to admit that this shrinks our field of inquiry considerably if you make good on what you have just said ill have nothing more to say it is easy to fool the shallow mind of the vulgar because it attends only to the surfaces of things and thinks about them not in detail but en bloc and so we find a blind reverence for religious faith and mystery but when a sharp philosopher comes to dissect and analyse these items of faith the deceit plainly appears and because he isnt blind he has no reverence for empty notionsor more accurately for mere forms of speech that mean nothing and are of no use to mankind the long speech that follows involves a theory of meaning and understanding that was widely accepted at the time its principal source is the third book of lockes essay concerning human understanding words are signs they stand for ideas or they ought to and so far as they suggest ideas they are significant words that dont suggest any ideas are insignificant someone who associates a clear idea with each word that he uses speaks sense and when such ideas are lacking the speaker utters nonsense so if we want to know whether someones speech is senseless and insignificant all we need do is to set aside the words and consider the ideas suggested by them because men cant immediately communicate their ideas to one another they have to use sensible signs or words the purpose of which is to raise in the hearers mind the ideas that are already are in the speakers and if they fail to do this they are useless for someone to count as understanding what he reads or hears he must have a sequence of ideas raised in his mind corresponding to the sequence of words that he has read or heard these are plain truths that men readily assent to in theory but they arent much attended to in practice so they deserve to be expounded in detail and drummed into people however obvious and undeniable they may be people in general dont much like thinking but they dont mind speaking and listening to the speech of others and the effect of that is that their minds are stored with names rather than ideas the husk of knowledge rather than knowledge itself and yet these words without meaning are often what mark off one party or sect or group of partisans from another forming the subject matter of their disputes and the object of their zeal this is the most general cause of error and it isnt restricted to ordinary minds even people who are regarded as acute and learned philosophers are often busy working at names instead of things or ideas and are thought to be expressing knowledge when really they are only uttering hard words without a meaning knowledge is the perception of the connection or disagreement between ideas and someone who doesnt distinctly perceive the ideas associated with the terms cant form a mental proposition corresponding to the verbal one so obviously that person cant possibly have knowledge he cant even be said to have opinion or faith these imply a weaker assent than knowledge does but it still has to be assent to a proposition and although the agreement or disagreement of the ideas wont be as evident as in the case of knowledge the terms of the verbal proposition have to be understood just as clearly as they are in knowledge which means that the conventionally associated ideas must be clearly in the persons mind ill say it again all degrees of assentwhether based on reason or authority and wherever they are on the spectrum from i am compelled to believe this at one end to i am faintly more inclined to accept this than to deny it at the otherare internal acts of the mind that are directed at ideas without which there really cant be any such thing as knowledge faith or opinion we can perhaps raise a dust by arguing with one another about purely verbal propositions but that is mere trifling all this will be readily agreed to with respect to human learning and science here abstract theoretically organised and deductively interlocked bodies of knowledge because in that domain it is a generally accepted method of exposing any doctrine or thesis to strip off its words and examine what ideasif anyare underneath this is often found to be the shortest way to end disputes which might otherwise grow and multiply without end with the disputants not understanding one another or themselves i neednt give examples this doctrine about meaning and understanding shines by its own light and is accepted by all thinking men what i shall do is to apply the doctrine to our present topic i hope i dont need to argue that the rules of reason and good sense that hold sway in all other subjects ought to be applied in religion also well there are those who consider faith and reason to be two distinct domains and want us to think that good sense has nothing to do with the domain of faithwhich is in fact the region where it has most to do i have decided never to argue with such men but leave them peacefully in possession of their prejudices in applying what i have said about ideas and understanding to issues in religion i shant single out any nitpicking disputes in academic theology nor shall i pick on any doctrines concerning the nature and essence of god because you might counter what i said about any of those by claiming that god is infinite and that the problem i had raised was part of our general difficulty in grasping the nature of infinity the central item in the christian dispensation is grace nothing is mentioned or considered more often than grace is throughout the new testament which represents it as something of a very special kind distinct from anything revealed to the jews or known by the light of nature this same grace is spoken of as the gift of god as coming through jesus christ as reigning as abounding as operating men are said to speak through grace and to believe through grace mention is made of the glory of grace the riches of grace the stewards of grace christians are said to be heirs of grace to receive grace grow in grace be strong in grace to stand in grace and to fall from grace and lastly grace is said to justify and to save them hence christianity is styled the covenant or dispensation of grace meaning that christianity rests on promises that god has made through grace and favours that he has given through grace and its well known that no point has created more controversy in the church than this doctrine of grace there have been many disputes about the nature extent and effects of grace and about the kinds of graceuniversal efficacious sufficient preventing and irresistible that have employed the pens of protestant as well as roman catholic theologians and he reels off the names of several christian sects im not even slightly interested in just what these disputes have been so i shant try to list them now all i need to make my point is that great contests on these points have existed and still continue what i would like to be told is the answer to this what is the clear and distinct idea associated with the word grace presumably one can know the bare meaning of a term without going into the depth of all those learned inquiries and controversies this is surely an easy matter provided there is an idea connected to the term and if there isnt it cant be a subject of a rational dispute or an object of real faith of course men may indeed deceive themselves or others by claiming to argue and believe when basically there is no argument or belief that goes beyond mere verbal trifling i can easily understand grace in one of its everyday nonreligious senses grace meaning beauty a blushing womanly grace and grace meaning favour the signs of grace that the queen showed to raleigh but when grace names an active vital ruling principle roughly source of energy or activity see b in euphranors speech on pages influencing and operating on the mind of man and distinct from every natural power or motive i declare that i cant understand it or form any distinct idea of it and therefore i cant assent to any proposition about it and so i cant have any faith regarding it and its a selfevident truth that god doesnt require anyone to do what he cant do when alciphron talks of a word as signifying a distinct idea he may mean that the idea is intrinsically clear or that the idea is distinct from all ideas associated with other words or both in this version distinct will be allowed to stand unexplained a philosophical friend of mine asked me to look at the writings of some theologians that he showed me which i did and i also talked with others on this subject but after all my reading and conversations i could make nothing of it whenever i set aside the word grace and looked into my own mind i found a complete absence of ideas and because i suspect that mens minds and abilities are much alike i suspect that other men if they examined what they call grace with the same exactness and lack of bias would agree with me that there was nothing to it but an empty name this isnt the only example of a meaningless word that is often heard and spoken but is believed to be intelligible simply because it is familiar there are many others that occur in sentences that are said to express necessary articles of faith the fraud that grace imposes on mankind is i think partly the following men speak of this holy principle as of something that acts moves and makes things happen taking their ideas from physical thingsfrom motion and the force or momentum of bodies because bodies are obvious and perceptible men put them in place of grace a spiritual and incomprehensible thing that is clearly a delusion even if our idea of bodily force is ever so clear and intelligible it doesnt follow that the idea of grace a supposed force but one that has nothing bodily about it must be clear and intelligible too and though we can reason clearly perceive assent and form opinions about bodily force it doesnt at all follow that we can do the same regarding grace and so it comes about that a clear sensebased idea of something real producesor rather is made a pretence foran imaginary spiritual faith that isnt actually about anything i call the faith imaginary because it isnt possible for it to be real where there are no ideas there cant be any assent and where there is no assent there cant be any faith and if something is impossible no man can be obliged to have it or do itthats as clear as anything in euclid whatever it is that words are used for i cant believe that they are used to do impossible things so let us look into what they are used for and see if we can make sense of our daily practice words it is agreed are signs so it might be as well to examine the use of other signs so as to understand the use of words counters at a cardtable are used not for their own sake but only as signs substituted for money as words are substituted for ideas tell me alciphron is it necessary every time these counters are used throughout the game to form an idea of the precise amount of money that each represents by no means all thats needed is that the players agree on their respective values at the outset and cash them in at those values when the game is over and in adding up some numbers where the figures stand for pounds shillings and pence do you think its necessary to form ideas of pounds shillings and pence at each step in the operation i dont all that is required is for the figures on the bottom line to direct our actions appropriately with respect to things it seems to follow from this that words can be significant even if they dont every time they are used arouse in our minds the ideas that they signify because its enough for meaningfulness if we have it in our power to substitute things or ideas for the words when there is a call for it it seems to follow also that words have a use additional to that of marking and suggesting distinct ideas namely influencing our behaviour and there are two ways for them to do thatforming rules for us to act by and arousing certain passions dispositions and emotions in our minds so it seems that a discourse that tells us how to act or spurs the doing or notdoing of an action can be useful and significant even if the words making it up dont each bring a distinct idea into our minds it seems so tell me alciphron isnt an idea altogether inactive it is so an agentsomething that does things an active mind or spiritcant be an idea and cant be like an idea from which it would seem to follow that the words that stand for an active principle soul or spirit dont stand for ideas in the strict and proper sense of ideas but they arent insignificant or meaningless as i can show through one really striking example namely the word i or the word myself as used by me i understand what it signifies i know what it means but what it signifies isnt an idea and isnt like an idearather it is something that thinks and wills and grasps ideas and does things with them it cant be denied that we know what is meant by the terms myself will memory love hate and so forthwe have some notion that we understand relating to themeven though strictly speaking these words dont suggest distinct ideas to us in this version of the seventh dialogue the uses of idea and notion will exactly track berkeleys what would you infer from this what i have inferred already namely that words can be significant without standing for ideas its because people thought otherwise that the doctrine of abstract ideas has arisen do you deny that the mind can abstract i dont deny that it can abstract in a certain sense of that word we can think about one thing separately from another if but only if they could exist separately and could be perceived separately so we can abstract by thinking about a mans head and not about his body or think about colour without thinking about motion or think about shape without thinking about weight but it doesnt follow from this that the mind can frame abstract general ideaseg thinking about colour without thinking about any specific huewhich appear to be impossible yet it is generally thought these days that every noun replacing substantive name here and throughout marks out and exhibits to the mind one distinct idea separate from all others tell me alciphron isnt the word number a noun it is well now see if you can form an idea of number in abstractnot bringing verbal signs or things that are numbered speaking for myself i cant can it be so difficult to form a simple idea of number which is the subjectmatter of a most evident demonstrable science wait a bit let me see if i cant abstract the idea of number from numberwords and numerals and from all particular countable things long pause to tell the truth i dont find that i can apparently then neither you nor i can form distinct simple ideas of number and yet we can make a very proper and significant use of numberwords and numerals they direct us in the management of our affairs and do it in such an essential way that we would be lost without them and yet if other mens abilities are like mine achieving a precise simple abstract idea of number is as difficult as is comprehending any mystery in religion to come now to your example let us examine what idea we can form of force abstracted from body motion and outward perceptible effects speaking again for myself i dont find that i have or can have any such idea surely everyone knows what is meant by force and yet i question whether everyone can form a distinct idea of force i beg you alciphron dont be distracted by words set aside the word force and exclude everything else from your thoughts and then see what precise idea you have of force force is that in bodies which produces motion and other perceptible effects it is then something distinct from those effects it is well then please now set aside any thought of the thing that has the force and the effects that follow from it and contemplate force itself through its own precise idea i have to say that i find it difficult shut your eyes to assist your meditation alciphron closed his eyes and thought for a few minutes and then declared that he couldnt do it well then replied euphranor there is something that it seems neither you nor i can form an idea of and your own remark that mens minds and abilities are much alike implies that noone else has any more of an idea of it than we do it does and yet there are certainly many speculations reasonings and disputes refined subtleties and intricate distinctions relating to this same force and to explain its nature and mark out the different notions of it or kinds of it learned men have used the terms gravity reaction inertial force inherent force immediate force dead force live force momentum solicitatio conatus and various other such expressions and big controversies have arisen about the notions or definitions of these terms men had wanted to know whether force is spiritual or bodily whether it remains after action how it is transferred from one body to another strange paradoxes have been concocted about its nature properties and proportions for instance that opposite forces can exist at the same time in the same quiescent body that the force of percussion in a small particle is infinite he names a book in which details can be found and goes on at some length about controversies between leibniz and others over forces in physics then the ingenious toricelli says concerning the momentum and the velocity of heavy falling bodies that they are a certain something and an idontknowwhat what does all this tell us about the idea of forcejust force itself setting aside body time space motion and all the perceptible measures of force cant we say that its as difficult to form an idea of force as to form an idea of grace i dont know what to think about that but i presume youll agree that some propositions or theorems relating to force are obviously true and also useful for instance what berkeley wrote that a body with conjunct forces describes the diagonal of a parallelogram in the same time that it would the sides with separate what he ought to have meant if a body is subject to two forces represent them by two lines drawn from a single pointdirection representing direction and length representing strength add two more lines to complete a parallelogram the resultant force on the body is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram isnt this theorem very widely useful doesnt the doctrine of the composition and resolution of forces depend on it and through that countless rules and theorems telling us how to act and explaining phenomena all through mechanics and mathematical physics and if this theorem helps men to get the knowledge of many inventions in mechanics and teaches them how to make engines that they can use to do things that are otherwise hard or impossible and provides a key to discovering the nature of planetary motions in addition to all its usefulness here on earth are we going to say that it is not practically or theoretically useful because we have no distinct idea of force obviously not well given that we take that line with force what excuse have we for going a different way with grace if there are queries disputes perplexities and diverging notions and opinions about grace so there are about force also if we cant form any precise distinct idea of grace neither can we of force oughtnt we by parity of reasoning to conclude that there may be various true and useful propositions about grace just as there are about force and oughtnt you also to conclude that grace may for all you know to the contrary be an object of our faith and influence our life and actions by attacking evil habits and supporting good ones even though we cant get a distinct idea of grace all on its own separated or abstracted from god who produces it man who receives it and virtue and piety that result from it shant we allow the same method of arguing the same rules of logic reason and good sense to hold sway in spiritual matters as in physical ones in faith as well as in physics and when we are examining gods revelations shant we use the same candour and make the same allowances as we do when examining the discoveries of men i cant see how a philosopher can be free from bias and prejudice or be said to weigh things in an equal balance if he maintains the doctrine of force and rejects that of grace or admits the abstract idea of triangle while ridiculing the holy trinity anyway however partial or prejudiced other minute philosophers may be you have laid it down as a maxim that the same logic which governs in other matters must be admitted in religion alciphron i think youd do better to stay with the method of wit and humour rather than trying religion by the dry test of reason and logic dont worry by all the rules of right reason it is absolutely impossible that any mysteryespecially the trinityshould really be the object of mans faith im not surprised that you thought so while you held that noone could assent to a verbal proposition without forming in his mind distinct ideas associated with the words in it but you have agreed that those signs can be significant even if they dont suggest ideas represented by them provided they serve to regulate and influence our wills passions or behaviour which commits you to agreeing also that a mans mind can assent to propositions containing such terms when it is directed or affected by them even if it doesnt perceive in itself distinct ideas marked by those terms it seems to follow from this that a man can believe the doctrine of the trinity if he finds it revealed in the bible that the father the son and the holy ghost are god and that there is only one god he can believe this doctrine of a creator redeemer and sanctifier three persons making one substanceeven though he doesnt form in his mind any abstract or distinct ideas of trinity person or substance provided that the doctrine has the right effect on his mind producing in it love hope gratitude and obedience thereby becoming a lively operative principle that influences his life and actions in ways that fit with the notion of saving faith that is required in a christian whether this is right or wrong it seems to follow from what you have declared together with what you have conceded i wonder if there is anything parallel to this christian faith in the minute philosophy suppose a fine gentleman or lady of fashion who are too busy to think for themselves and are only freethinkers at secondhand have the advantage of being initiated quite early into the principles of your sect by listening to men of depth and genius who have often expressed the opinion that the world is governed either by fate or by chance and it doesnt matter which see qa note on page i you wont deny that it is possible for such persons to give their assent to either of these propositions the fate one and the chance one ii and their assent can properly be called faith iii and yet these disciples of the minute philosophy may be unable to dive deep enough to form any abstract or precise or definite idea of fate or of chance iv so that this same gentleman or lady may be said to believe or have faith where they dont have ideas v and this faith or conviction can produce real effects showing itself in the conduct and tone of their lives freeing them from the fears of superstition and giving them a true liking for the world with a noble indifference about any afterlife and cant christians with equal reason be allowed to believe in the divinity of our saviour or believe that in him god and man make one person and be genuinely convinced of this so that this faith or belief becomes a real principle of life and conduct because of this belief that they have they submit to his government believe his doctrine and behave according to his precepts even though they dont form any abstract idea of the union between the divine and human nature and even though they cant clear up the notion of person in a way that will satisfy a minute philosopher it seems obvious to me that we wouldnt so often be faced with a demand for a clear and distinct idea of person in relation to the trinity and wouldnt so often find difficulties about this being treated as objections to our faith if these demands and objections were made only by people who had delicately examined and could themselves explain the principle of individuation in man or could untie the knots and answer the objections that can be raised even about human personal identity alciphron says that he doesnt think there is any great mystery in personal identity and expresses agreement with lockes theory about this that is an opening for euphranor to argue against lockes thesis that as euphranor puts it personal identity consists in consciousness the argument is not worth much as it is based on a stunningly absurdly uncharitable reading of locke it was launched by reid essays on the intellectual powers of man essay chapter anyway this interchange contributes nothing to the rest of the dialogue which euphranor puts back on track thus there is i think a practical kind of faith or assent that shows itself in the will and actions of a man even if his understanding isnt furnished with corresponding abstract precise distinct ideas you indeed have conceded that there are many instances of such practical faith in other matters that dont involve religion so why shouldnt it be that doctrines relating to heavenly mysteries might also be taught in this saving sense to common minds that you may well think incapable of all teaching and faith of the sort you have been demanding this mistaken view of teaching and faith said crito has led to a great deal of profane and misapplied sarcasm but all that can fairly bounced back onto the minute philosophers themselves who muddle scholasticism with christianity and impute to other men the perplexities chimeras and inconsistent ideas that are often the work of their own brains and argue on the basis of their own wrong way of thinking anyone can see that such an ideal abstracted faith is never thought of by the great majority of christiansfarmers for example and artisans and servants and theres nothing in the bible to suggest that either jews or christians are required to engage in the delicately precise forming of abstract ideas nothing like this is to be found in the law or the prophets the evangelists or the apostles everyone whose understanding is not perverted by science falsely so called can see that the saving faith of christians is of quite another kind a vital operative principle roughly source of energy or activity see b in euphranors speech on pages that generates charity and obedience then what can we make of the disputes and decisions of the famous council of nicaea which drew up the socalled nicene creed and all the councils since that one what was the intention of those venerable fathers the homoousians and the homoiousians why did they disturb themselves and the world with hard words and subtle controversies those are greek words meaning respectively the same and similar the controversy was between two views about the relationship of the son to the father whatever their intention was it couldnt have been to do something that is obviously impossiblenamely create precise abstracted ideas of mysteries in the minds of common christians theres no evidence that the majority of christians in those days thought they were obliged to set aside words shut their eyes and form abstract ideas any more than men now form abstract ideas of force time number or many other things about which they nevertheless believe know argue and dispute it seems to me that whatever was the source of that controversy and however it was conducted what it was really about was not a desire by either side to convey precise positive ideas to the minds of men by the use of those controversial terms but rather something negativenamely a desire to exclude on one side the view that there are three gods and on the other the view that there is just one god of whom the father the son and the holy ghost are merely three aspects but so many learned and ingenious theologians have from time to time offered the world new explanations of mysteries claiming to have worked to get accurate ideas and wanting to recommend their discoveries and speculations to others as articles of faith what are we to make of them to all such innovators in religion i would say with hieronymus why after so many centuries do you claim to teach us something that hasnt been taught before why explain things that neither peter nor paul thought needed to be explained the explanation of mysteries in divinity is as futile as the pursuit of the philosophers stone see note on page in chemistry or the perpetual motion machine in mechanics but in each of the three cases the absurdity is to be blamed not on that branch of enquiry but only on wrongheaded people engaged in it what euphranor has been saying seems to be applicable also to other mysteries of our religion we may find it impossible to form an abstracted idea of original sin for example or an idea of how original sin is passed on from adam to the rest of us but the belief in it may produce in someones mind a salutary sense of his own unworthiness and of the goodness of his redeemer and from that may follow good habits and from them good actions which are the genuine effects of faith when faith is considered in its true light it can be seen to be neither inconsistent nor incomprehensible as some men want us to think it is but suited even to common capacities placed in the will and affections rather than in the understanding and producing holy lives rather than subtle theories faith isnt something you passively let flow into you its an operative conviction of mind which always produces some suitable action disposition or emotion in those who have it i could easily prove and illustrate this by countless instances taken from human affairs and indeed while the christian religion is considered as an institution fitted to ordinary minds rather than to the minds of hairsplitting theoreticians and while our notions about faith are accordingly taken from mankinds ordinary everyday life rather than from the special systems of faithimprovers i dont think it will be hard to understand the meaning and use of our belief in mysteries and to justify them against the most confident assertions and objections of the minute philosophers who can easily be caught in the very traps that they have set for others and that spirit of controversythe mother and nurse of heresieswould doubtless be much reduced if men would grasp that things should be rated not by their colour shape or trademark so truly as by their weight if some litigious theologians had proportioned their zeal to the importance of the opinions they were propounding that would greatly reduce the zealous intensity of most of what they had to say which would have spared them and us a great deal of trouble someone who takes his notions of faith opinion and assent from common sense and common usage and has maturely weighed the nature of signs and of language wont be so ready to quarrel about the wording of a mystery or to break the peace of the church so as to retain or reject a word heres a plain example that should convince you of the effective and necessary use of faith without ideas the example concerns a convinced minute philosopher a coarse and callous man with large appetites and not much money who has an opportunity to perform one villainous act that will make him richan act that he knows he can get away with what is there to deter him certainly not a sense of the beauty of virtue see alciphrons speech on pages in fact the only way to get some moral leverage on this man is to produce in him a sincere belief in a future state although it is a mystery although it is what eye has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive corinthians this belief will restrain him from carrying out his wicked project to a reasonable reflective philosophical mind the points insisted on by your refined beautyofvirtue moralists may be as lovely and excellent as you please but i venture to say that given mankind as it is very few people would be influenced by them so we see the necessary use of faith as well as its powerful effects and none of this involves having ideas you and euphranor apparently want to convince me that the belief in mysteries doesnt involve anything as utterly absurd as we are apt to think and that a man neednt renounce his reason to maintain his religion but if this is true why is it that mens faith dwindles in proportion as their knowledge grows i have learned from you alciphron that there is nothing like getting to the bottom of things and analysing them into their basic elements so ill try to do that with the question of the nature of faithyoull have to judge whether i succeed the objections that are made to faith dont come from knowledge but rather from ignorance of what knowledge is and that ignorance might be found even in people who are regarded as masters of this or that particular branch of knowledge science and faith have this in common they both involve an assent of the mind and as the nature of scientific assent is most clear and evident we should consider it first in order to cast a light on the assent involved in faith to trace things back to their origins the human mind needs aids that are not part of its basic natural equipment it is naturally furnished with the ideas of particular and concrete as distinct from abstract things and what its designed for is not merely being aware of its ideas but pursuing its own happiness by actively operating on the basis of them for the scientific pursuit of knowledge about the origins of things therefore the mind needs extra help specifically it needs certain general rules or theorems to guide it in this pursuit and the true original reasonable end of studying the arts and sciences is to acquire such rules because these rules are general they cant be obtained by the mere consideration of the original ideas or particular things but only by means of marks or signs and these being general in the sense that they are used for general purposes become the immediate instruments and materials of science so the mind makes its progress not by mere contemplation of particular things even less by contemplating abstract general ideas of things but by appropriately choosing and skillfully managing signs for example everyone knows about force and number in concrete situations along with things that accompany them things that have them and signs of them and noone has any understanding of force and number considered in the abstract and captured in precise abstract ideas so its clear that their abstract nature isnt a foundation for science and that merely considering their ideas in their concrete form isnt the way to advance in the respective sciences of physics and mathematics because nothing is more evident than that someone who cant read or write understands the meanings of numeral words in concrete situations as well as the best scientist or mathematician but here lies the difference the one who understands the notation of numbers can use it to express briefly and clearly all the variety and degrees of number and to perform easily and quickly many arithmetical operations by the help of general rules its obvious how useful these operations are in human life and equally obvious that performing them requires having an appropriate notation if mankind were in a very primitive state with no use of language they wouldnt know any truths of arithmetic their first step towards that science would be the acquisition of names for numbers so that they could signify numbers as high as you like by repeating those names in a certain order the next step would be to associate those names with visible markspermanent ones not like sounds which dont last if this system of marking this notation was done well it would make it easier for us to discover and apply general rules to assist the mind in reasoning and judging and in extending recording and communicating its knowledge about numbers what the mind is immediately concerned with in these activities are the signs or numerals through which it is directed to act in relation to things or number in concrete as the logicians call it without ever considering the simple abstract intellectual general idea of number i dont think it is hard to be convinced that the science of arithmetic is entirely concernedin its rise operations rules and theoremswith the conventional use of signs which are of two sorts names that are words and numerals these names and numerals are in their roles as signs universal the names are related to things the characters are related to the names and both names and characters are related to operations there arent many basic names of numbers the stock of them being enlarged by a certain analogy so a system of characters will be useful to the extent that it is simple and aptly expresses this analogy thus words written at length were less useful than the old roman numerals which in turn were less useful than the modern notation for example two hundred and fortyfour was less useful than ccxliv which was less useful than and the invention of algebraical symbols was a further advance for extensive and general use so there we have it arithmetic and algebra are sciences of great clearness certainty and extent whose immediate topic is signs on the skillful use and management of which they entirely depend perhaps a little attention to them may help us to understand the progress of the mind in other sciences which differ in nature design and purpose but may nevertheless agree in the general methods of proof and inquiry in my view all sciences that are universal and demonstrable by human reason will be found to have signs as their immediate object though in applying a science we connect these signs with things it isnt hard to grasp why this is so nothing is more natural for us than to use the things we do know as stepping stones towards things we dont know and to explain and represent less familiar things by others that are more familiar now it is certain that a before we reflect we imagine and b before we imagine we perceive by our senses and that c of all our senses eyesight is the most clear distinct various agreeable and comprehensive so its natural for us a to help the intellect by imagination b to help imagination by sense and c to help the other senses by sight hence figures metaphors and symbols we illustrate mental things by physical ones we substitute sounds for thoughts and written letters for sounds we use emblems symbols and hieroglyphics for things that are too obscure to strike our minds and too various or too fleeting to be retained we substitute imaginable things for intelligible ones sensible things for imaginable ones smaller things for ones that are too big to comprehend easily and larger things for ones that are too small to be clearly picked out present things for absent ones permanent things for perishing ones and visible things for invisible ones hence the use of models and diagrams thus lines are substituted for time velocity and other things of very different natures thus again we speak of minds in a figurative way describing their operations by terms borrowed from perceptible things such as apprehend conceive reflect discourse and the like apprehend comes from latin meaning seize conceive from take together reflect from bend back discourse from run to and fro euphranor talks a little about allegories eg platos representing the mind by the driver of a winged chariot which etc etc then im inclined to think that the doctrine of signs matters a great deal over a very wide area and that if it were properly considered it would cast a lot of light on things and provide a genuine solution for many difficulties so we can say this much about all signs they dont always suggest ideas signified to the mind when they do suggest ideas they arent general abstract ideas they have other uses such as raising proper emotions producing certain dispositions or habits of mind and directing our actions in pursuit of the happiness that is the ultimate end and design the primary spring and motive that sets rational agents at work the real purpose of speech whether it is being used in reasoning or in expressing theoretical knowledge or faith or some degree of belief is not primarily to give or get ideas but rather to guide actions aimed at bringing about some conceived good sometimes indeed words can lead to suitable actions not merely without communicating any ideas but without such ideas being even possible an example is the algebraic sign standing for the square root of a negative number this is useful in logical operations although it is impossible to have an idea of any such quantity as and what is true of algebraic signs is also true of words or language in fact modern algebra is a languagea compact appropriate artificial sort of languageand any algebraic calculation could be expressed by ordinary words much less conveniently but with nothing left out also theres no avoiding the fact that even the mathematical sciences themselvessupposed to the most clear and certain sciences that we haveoften fall short of the clear and distinct ideas that todays minute philosophers whether knowingly or ignorantly insist on in the mysteries of religion im talking here about mathematics considered as theory not about practical applied mathematics in absolutely any science or field of activity men will be sure to embarrass themselves with difficulties and disputes if they move from particulars to generalities from concrete things to abstractions or relinquish practical views and the useful purposes of knowledge in favour of barren theorising regarding means and instruments as ultimate ends and struggling to get the precise ideas that they suppose to be associated with all words im talking about difficulties and disputes such as the ones that have sprung up in geometry about the nature of the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent proportions indivisibles infinitesimals and various other matters despite all of which geometry itself is rightly admired as an excellent and useful science it really does prove useful in many reallife situations where it governs and directs the actions of men enabling them to do in a sound and accurate way things that would otherwise be faulty and uncertain and by parity of reasoning we shouldnt regard any other doctrines that govern influence or direct the mind of man to be less true or excellent because they provide material for controversy and useless theorizing by troublemakers this applies especially to the articles of our christian faith with regard to which belief leads to persuasion which in turn influences the lives and actions of men as for the perplexity of contradictions and abstracted notions that crop up in secular sciences and divine faith nitpickers may use it as an objection incautious people may stray into it while judicious people keep away from it the belief of christians can be justified without departing from the accepted rules of reasoning and if any pious men think otherwise thats probably a result not of religion or of reason but merely of human weakness if there are especially many unbelievers in our time i shant conclude that our time knows more than former agesonly that it is more arrogantly selfconfident and i dont think that this confidence is a result of much thought it seems to me that the more thoroughly and extensively any man investigates and thinks about the principles aims and methods that occur in secular arts and sciences the more convinced he will be that theres no weight in the plausible objections that are brought against the mysteries of faith and he wont have much difficulty maintaining and justifying his position using accepted methods of argument and the common principles of logic appealing to countless parallel cases all through the many branches of human knowledge in all of which the supposition of abstract ideas creates the same difficulties according to this doctrine anything can be maintained therell be nothing absurd in popery not even in transubstantiation the doctrine that in the sacrament of the eucharist the bread and wine become the body and blood of jesus pardon me what i have been saying doesnt justify any article of faith that isnt contained in scripture is in conflict with human reason implies a contradiction or leads to idolatry or wickedness of any kind those four disqualifiers are very different from not being representable by distinct or abstract ideas ill allow euphranor that your reasoning has all the force you meant it to have i freely admit that there may be mysteries that we can believe things that we dont understand and that faith can be useful even when what its about is not distinctly grasped in short i agree that there can be faith and mysteries in other thingsbut not in religion the plain reason for this is that its absurd to suppose there to be any such thing as religion and if theres no religion then there cant be religious faith or mysteries religion obviously implies the worship of a god which worship presupposes rewards and punishments which presuppose merits and demerits good and evil actions and these presuppose human freedom and that is impossible which means that religion which is built on it must be unreasonable and absurd it cant be reasonable to have fears where there is no guilt and there cant be guilt when everything that happens follows unavoidably from the structure of the world and the laws of motion here is what happens when a man as we say raises his hand to shade his eyes from the sun physical objects strike on his senseorgans specifically lightparticles strike his eyes those organs the eyes start a vibration in the nerves that vibration is passed along to the soul or animal spirits in the brain or root of the nerves see note on page starting up in them the kind of motion called volition the volition starts up a new movement in the animal spirits this causes the spirits to flow into certain nerves the events in those nerves cause bodily movements that constitute the action in question in our case cause his hand to go up over his eyes and all of this happens necessarily by the laws of mechanism so the events that we ordinarily take to be human actions should be regarded as mechanical and its just wrong to think they have a source that is free so there is no basis for praise or blame fear or hope reward or punishment and religion as i have already pointed out is built on and presupposes those things if i have understood you rightly alciphron you regard man as a sort of organ that is played on by external objects which produce different motions and effects in the organ depending on the different shapes and textures of the nerves the comparison with an organ is not bad but the best comparison is with a puppet certain particles coming in straight lines from all perceptible objects compose so many rays or filaments that push pull and activate every part of the soul and body of man just as threads or wires operate on the joints of the little wooden machine ordinarily called a puppet the only difference is that the puppets wires are thick and visible to ordinary eyes whereas the formerthe rays or filaments that enter into the causation of human socalled actionsare too fine and subtle to be spotted by any but an able freethinker this splendidly accounts for all the operations that we have been taught to ascribe to a source of thought within us thats an ingenious line of thought and must contribute greatly to freeing men from all anxiety about moral notions by tracing their actions not to a source in the human soul but rather to external things but i have some worries about it you suppose the mind to be in a literal sense moved and you take its volitions to be mere motions but suppose someone said and lets face it someone may that the soul is not a body that motion is one thing and volition another id like to know how you would go about convincing such a person your account will be very clear to those who accept that the soul is a body and that all its acts are merely motions given that basis our account of human nature is true fine and new but if someone denies your supposition that the soul is corporeala denial that its very easy to makethen everything you have built on it collapses if we grant that the soul is a body and volitions are motions we are certainly committed then to a fatal necessity ie to the view that all our actions are necessary in the sense that whatever we do we were fated to do bound to do inevitably going to do but i see no reason for granting those two points on the contrary it seems clear that motion and thought are two things as really and as obviously distinct from one another as a triangle is from a sound so it looks as though your argument for the necessity of human actions has a premise that needs to be proved just as badly as the conclusion does well if we suppose that the mind is not corporeal i can still prove my conclusion i shant baffle you with farfetched arguments and merely ask you to look into yourself and observe what happens when some object comes before your mind your understanding considers it then your judgment makes some decree about it as a thing to be chosen or rejected to be done or not done and if done then done thus and not so this decree of the judgment necessarily determines the will whose role is merely to carry out anything ordained by another faculty something necessary cant be free so theres no such thing as freedom of the will freedom is present only when there is an indifference to either side of the question ie when the deliberating mind is evenly poised between the alternatives a power to act or not act without being told what to do or in any way controlled by something external to the will and its obvious that the will cant be free when it doesnt have this indifference and this power and its equally obvious that the will is not indifferent in its actions being absolutely determined and governed by the faculty of judgment my point is not affected by the question of what it is that moves the judgmentwhether its the greatest present uneasiness as locke came to think or the greatest apparent good as many have thought including locke to begin with or something else again whatever it is that moves the judgment the fact remains that the will is always settled and controlled by the judgment and so is always subject to necessity nowhere in the entire human makeup is there anything like a free agent every faculty is determined in all its acts by something external to it the understanding for instance cant alter one of its ideasit necessarily sees each idea in the way that it presents itself the appetites are carried towards their respective objects by a natural necessity reason cant infer anything from anything just as it chooses it is limited by the nature and connection of things and the eternal rules of reasoning which means that it is subject to necessity and the same is true for all our other faculties as well as for the will itself as i have already shown and if we can believe the divine characterizer of our times the will must be agreed to be the most slavish of all our faculties the earl of shaftesbury author of characteristics of etc was widely liked and admired but even alciphron wouldnt call him divine in making him do so berkeley is throwing in a sarcastic jibe of his own some admirers of the present work regret its intemperate hostility to shaftesbury appetite says that noble writer which is reasons older and stronger brother is sure in every contest to be on the winning side as for the will so highly boasted of it is never better than a football for those youngsters to kick or a spinningtop for them to whip to keep it moving the youngsters turn out to be very illmatched and eventually the younger of them instead of now and then getting in a kick or a lash to little purpose leaves the ball or top and starts to kick or lash his older brother crito comments sarcastically on the style and manner of this beautiful parable and asks why the weaker brother would get satisfaction from attacking the stronger one alciphron brushes this off and then the same conclusion can also proved from gods foreknowledge whatever is certainly foreknown will certainly happen what will certainly happen is necessary necessary actions cant be the effect of freewill so now you have this fundamental thesis in our freethinking philosophy demonstrated in two different ways see qa note on page i the proposition that god creates something that is free is not selfcontradictory ii so it is possible that there may be such a thing as a free creature iii this is something that you can conceive and suppose iv such a free creature would think that he acted v and he would condemn himself for some actions and approve of himself for others vi he would think that he deserved reward or punishment vii and all these characteristics are actually found in man tell me now what other qualities does your supposed free agent haveones that are not to be found in man if there arent any we must conclude that man has all the marks of a free agent let me see i was certainly mistaken when i conceded that it was possible at least for almighty power to make such a thing as a free agent i wonder how i came to make such an absurd concession after what had been demonstrated in so many different ways certainly whatever doesnt imply a contradiction is possible for an infinite power and whatever is possible can be supposed therefore if rational agent isnt selfcontradictory then a rational agent can be supposed perhaps from this supposition i might infer that man is free but i wont suppose him to be a free agent since you apparently claim to have demonstrated that he isnt but listen its common knowledge that men base their opinions about others on themselves but when you reach a conclusion about me on the basis of what you know about yourself you may be mistaken many things that are clear to someone with your strength of intellect are not so clear to me who am often puzzled rather than enlightened by those very proofs that you regard as clear and evident i cant be thoroughly convinced by any inference however logically sound it is if its premises arent clear so please let me put questions to you your answers may sort out for me the things that at present i am confused about ill leave with you what i have already said for you to consider and chew over its time now for lysicles and me to set out for london so theres no time for a long questionandanswer session then let me make a couple of brief remarks on what you have said you take that for granted something that i cannot grant when you say that whatever is certain is necessary to me certain and necessary seem to be very different because theres nothing in certain that implies constraint and so theres nothing in it that isnt consistent with a mans being accountable for his actions if it is foreseen that suchandsuch an action will be done cant it also be foreseen that it will be done as an effect of human choice and liberty you delicately abstract and distinguish the actions of the mind judgment and will you use such terms as power faculty act determination indifference freedom necessity and so on as if they stood for distinct abstract ideas and this supposition seems to ensnare the mind into the same perplexities and errors that have been seen to accompany the doctrine of abstraction in every other context its selfevident that there is such a thing as motion and yet some philosophers have tried by refined reasoning to prove there is no such thing walking before them was thought the proper way to confute those ingenious men diogenes is reported to have said à propos of zenos difficulty about how there could be motion i solve it by walking it is equally obvious that man is a free agent and though by abstracted reasonings you might puzzle me and seem to prove that he isnt so long as i am conscious of my own actions this inward evidentness of a plain fact will bear me up against all your reasonings however subtle and refined they may be opposing plain propositions by obscure ones may convince me that your philosophers are clever but it wont convince me that their opinions are true i cant conceive why the acute cratylus shaftesburyin his football metaphor page should allow a power of acting to the appetite and to reason the brothers but not to the will the football if we allow that the mind does contain these three distinct beings i dont see how this could be true of them but i dont find it necessary to abstract and distinguish as many beings in the soul of man as you do which reconciles me to the fact that i cant do so without any such distinction it is evident to metaking myself as a whole not as minutely dissectedthat i am a free agent im not helped to go further by being told that the will is a governed by the judgment or that it is b determined by the object because a in no ordinary everyday case can i separate the decree of my judgment from the command of my will b i know that the sensible object is absolutely inert and so cant determine anything and lastly i am conscious that i am an active being who can and do determine myself i dont know what theoretical results i might get if were to suppose spiritual or mental things to be corporeal or to refine actual and real things into general abstracted notions or by metaphysical skill to split simple and individual things into many parts but if instead of any of that i take things as they are and ask any plain untutored man whether he acts or is free in this or that particular action he immediately says yes and i immediately believe him on the basis of what i find within myself and thus by an induction from particular cases i can draw the general conclusion that man is a free agent even if i cant define or conceive an abstract notion of freedom in general if a man is free he is clearly accountable and if you define and abstract and suppose and infer from your definitions abstractions and suppositions that there cant be any freedom in man and then infer from this that he isnt accountable i shall take the liberty of departing from your metaphysical abstracted sense and appealing to the common sense of mankind if we consider the notions people have of guilt and merit praise and blame accountable and unaccountable well find the question of whether to applaud or censure someone acquit or condemn him always rests on the question did he perform the action in question or what comes to the same thing was he himself when he performed it so it seems that in our ordinary everyday thought and talk a person is regarded as accountable if he is an agent you tell me that man is inactive and that perceptible objects act on him but my own experience assures me of the contrary i know i act and i am accountable for what i do in acting and if this is true then the foundation of religion and morality remains unshaken the only question in this area that religion is concerned with is whether the man is accountable and according to my sense and the worlds common sense he is accountable if he acts and its selfevident that he does act so the grounds and purposes of religion are secured whether or not your philosophic notion of liberty fits mans actions and whether or not his actions are certain or contingent does he deserve the guilt or merit of the action in asking that we arent asking did he do it with a free will or what determined his will when he did it or was it certain or foreknown that he would do it the only question is did he do it wilfully but still the question keeps coming back is man free to answer this oughtnt we first to settle what is meant by the word free we ought in my opinion a man is said to be free insofar as he can do what he wills to do isnt that right it seems so so a man who acts according to his will is to be accounted free i admit that this is right in the vulgar see note on page sense of free but a philosopher goes higher than that and asks whether a man is free to will that is whether he can will as he wills i dont know how philosophical it may be to ask this question but to me it seems very idle the notions of guilt and merit justice and reward are in mens minds in advance of any metaphysical lectures or chapters and according to those accepted natural notions there is no doubt that man is accountable that he acts that he is selfdetermined but a minute philosopher misled by wrong initial suppositions runs together things that are obviously distinct bodyspirit motionvolition certaintynecessity and an abstracter or refiner analyses the simplest instantaneous act of the mind to the point where he thinks he can find within it various faculties and tendencies principles and operations causes and effects note the symmetry identifying things that are really distinct and distinguishing things that are really identical and after he has abstracted supposed and reasoned concerning gratuitous and obscure principles he will conclude that the act in question isnt an act at all and that man is not an agent but a puppet or an organ played on by external objects and his will is a top or a football and this passes for philosophy and freethinking whatever it passes for it doesnt at all seem like a natural or sound way of thinking it seems to me that if we start from things that are particular and concrete and proceed from them to general notions and conclusions well have no trouble in this area but if we start with generalities and lay our foundations in abstract ideas well find ourselves entangled and lost in a labyrinth of our own making i neednt point outbecause anyone can see ithow ridiculous it is to claim to prove that man is not an agent while also pleading for free thought and action thus posing as advocates of necessity and of liberty i have hastily thrown together these hints or remarks about this fundamental thesis in our freethinking philosophy as you call it and about your method of arguing for it which seems to provide a fine specimen of the sophistry of abstract ideas if my brevity has led me to be inappropriately dogmatic you must excuse meyou started it by declining to join me in a leisurely examination of the truth i think we have examined matters sufficiently to everything you have said against human liberty it is a sufficient answer to point out that your arguments are wrong from the outseteither because they suppose the soul to be corporeal or because they rely on abstract ideas supposing the soul to be solid is no better than supposing it to be red or blue supposing the will to consist in motion is no better than supposing the will to be you name it these premises about the soul and the will are to put it mildly neither proved nor probable and i see no obstacle to rejecting everything you infer from them and your arguments also contain other gross mistakes and baseless principles in any human action you distinguish the last decree of the judgment from the act of the will you confuse certainty with necessity you ask in effect the absurd question can a man will as he wills the proposition a man wills as he wills is an identical one ie a necessarily true logical triviality that is obviously the case which means that obviously there must be something wrong with the line of thought that led you to make a question of it you say that the appetites have by natural necessity a tendency towards their respective objects i agree and i add my agreement that appetites are not free but you go further telling us the understanding cant alter an idea that it has nor can it infer indifferently anything from anything just as it chooses what of it if we cant alter the nature of objects does that mean that we cant act at all the two versions of reflect berkeleys viewdefended in other works but mainly not in play in this onethat the objects that we perceive and talk about are ideas and if we arent at liberty to make absurd inferences does it follow that we arent free in any way you take it for granted that the mind is inactive but that its ideas act on it as if the contrary werent evident to everyone who has the common sense to know that when the mind considers its ideas it chooses rejects examines deliberates decreesie it acts on them and they dont act on it summing up because your premises are obscure and false the basic point that you claim to have demonstrated in so many different ways isnt shown to be true or even meaningful and on the other hand we dont have to do much research to be convinced that man acts and that man is accountable for his actions nothing is clearer or more obvious than those two propositions nothing is more universally accepted by men of all sorts learned and unlearned at all times and in all places whatever may be claimed by abstracters refiners and men who are committed to a false hypothesis i think it is obvious to every thinking man of common sense that human minds are so far from being machines or footballs acted on and kicked around by corporeal objects with no inner source of freedom or of action that the only basic true notions we have of freedom agent and action are ones we get by reflecting on ourselves and the operations of our own minds the minute philosophers allow themselves to be taken in by the invalid inferences of three or four eminent bishops of unbelief in recent times i cant think of anything that matches their unique credulity ie any other bigoted superstition whose ringleaders have been able so openly and widely to draw their followers from the plain dictates of nature and common sense the discoverers of truth have always met up with the objection that they are departing from accepted opinions the sneering label unique is a tax on freethinking and as such we most willingly accept it and glory in it a genuine philosopher is never modest in such a way as to prefer authority to reason or an old and common opinion to a true one such false modesty discourages men from treading in untrodden paths and from shining new light and that makes it a greater enemy to freethinking than any other personal quality a judicious person who will follow evidence wherever it leads will also allow authority to have its due weight on disputable points without preferring authority we can accept it as a good backup to reason so your gentlemen of the minute philosophy can save yourself the trouble of announcing all those commonplaces about reason and discoveries and light we arent attached to authority against reason or afraid of untrodden paths that lead to truth and we are ready to follow a new light once we are sure it isnt a willothewisp reason may oblige a man to believe something that he doesnt like but why should a man give up salutary notions in favour of others that are as unreasonable as they are harmful your schemes principles and boasted demonstrations have been proposed and examined at length you have shifted your notions successively retreated from one scheme to another and in the end renounced them all your objections to christianity have been treated in the same manner and with the same outcome if from the things you have held against christianity we set aside everything that comes from the errors and faults of particular persons and difficulties which from the nature of things we arent obliged to explain it is surprising to see how little remainsafter such magnificent threatsthat can amount to a relevant objection against the christian religion what you have produced has been tried by the fair test of reason and even if you hope to get the upper hand through ridicule when you cant get it through reason i predict that in the upshot youll find that you cant destroy all sense of religion how berkeley starts the next sentence make your countrymen ever so vicious ignorant and profane either he meant however vicious ignorant and profane you claim your countrymen to be or he meant however vicious ignorant and profane you cause your countrymen to be men will still be disposed to look up to a supreme being religion right or wrong will survive in some shape or other and there will surely be some worship either of god or the creature that is berkeleys phrasemeaning as for your ridicule well your sect presents us with the spectacle of the most unintelligible men of the age parading themselves as freethinkers men so strong in assertion yet so weak in argument advocates for freedom introducing necessity patriots trampling on the laws of their country claimants to virtue destroying the motives for virtue can anything be more ridiculous than that let any impartial man cast an eye on the opinions of the minute philosophers and then say if anything can be more ridiculous than to believe such things and at the same time laugh at the credulity of others say what you will we have the laughers on our side and as for your reasoning i take that to be another name for sophistry and i suppose by the same rule you take your own sophisms to be arguments let me be frank about this i dont know of any type of sophismany type of logical mistakethat minute philosophers dont use against religion they are guilty of working from false assumptions in taking it for granted that we believe contradictions of bad causal thinking in asserting that uncharitable feuds and discords are the effects of christianity and of pointmissing in demanding that we demonstrate things that we only claim to believe as matters of faith crito gives each of these a technical latin label speaking for myself if sophistry is the art or power of deceiving other men i must acquit these gentlemen of it they seem to have led me on a journey through atheism libertinism fanaticism and fatalism not to convince me of the truth of any of them so much as to confirm me in my own way of thinking they have displayed their flimsy wares not to cheat but to amuse us knowing them to be selfannounced masters of ridicule i dont know what seriously to make of them you dont know what to make of us id be sorry if you did only a superficial philosopher can be quickly fathomed creating ambiguity about where one stands seems to be the sure way to fame and esteem in the learned world as it now is when an able reader cant decide whether his author is atheist or deist or polytheist stoic or epicurean sceptic or dogmatist unbeliever or religious fanatic joking or serious he immediately concludes that the author is enigmatic and deep in fact its true of the most admired writers of our time that noone can tell what to make of them or what they are getting at we have among us moles that dig deep under ground and eagles that soar out of sight we can act all parts and become all opinions putting them on or off with great freedom of wit and humour it seems then that you are a pair of inscrutable unfathomable fashionable philosophers that cant be denied but i remember that you started off with an open dogmatic air talked of plain principles and evident reasoning and promised to make things as clear as noonday to wipe out wrong notions and plant right ones in their place before long though you began to back away from your first notions and adopt others you advanced one while retracting another asserted and conceded said and unsaid and after having followed you through so many untrodden paths and intricate mazes i find myself no nearer to understanding what you actually think didnt we tell you that the gentlemen of our sect are very good at teasing but it seems to me to be useless for a plain man with some settled beliefs or principles to do battle with such slippery dodging changeable philosophers the rule seems to be the christian man must stand still in one place while his freethinking adversary chooses and changes his fightingposition has full range and liberty to move around the battlefield and attack his christian opponent on all sides in all shapes from close up or with missiles from far away on horseback or on foot in light or heavy armour theres no denying that a gentleman has a great advantage over a straitlaced pedant or bigot but at the end of it all how am i better off from the conversation of two such knowledgeable gentlemen i hoped to unlearn my errors and to learn truths from you but i find to my great disappointment that i havent been untaught anything or taught anything its hard to unteach men their prejudices but that has to be done before we can offer to teach them the truth and anyway we dont now have time to prove and argue the ensuing remarks about laws of hospitality confinement in the castle etc are a running joke it looks like a rather thin cover for the anger and contempt that have been building up especially on the christian side well suppose that my mind is white paper and that you are invited to write on it the things that you would teach me if only i were teachable dont try to wipe out my present opinions or to prove your own for once dont joke or tease just let me know some one conclusion of yours before we part if you dont ill beg crito to violate the laws of hospitality towards those who have violated the laws of philosophy by hanging out false lights to someone who isaccording to youbenighted in ignorance and error false lights were lights placed on the seashore in a position that is likely to draw a ship onto the rocks i appeal to you shouldnt these philosophical knighterrants be confined in this castle of yours until they make reparation euphranor is right said crito and my sentence is that you remain here in prison until you have done something towards satisfying my undertaking to euphranor which was that he would know your opinions from yourselves which you also agreed to since it must be so i will now reveal what i take to be the sum and substance the grand arcanum see note on page and final conclusion of our sect i can do it in two words and he utters a twogreekword sentence which means there are only hypotheses so youre a downright sceptic but sceptic as you are you admit that it is probable that there is a god certain that the christian religion is useful possible that it is true certain that if it is true the minute philosophers are in bad shape given all this how can there be any question about what course a wise man should take whether the principles of christians or unbelievers are truest may be made a question but there is no question about which are safest if you have doubts about all opinions you must have doubts about your own which means that for all you know christianity may be true the more doubt the more room there is for faith because a sceptic has less right than anyone else to demand evidence evidentness but whatever uncertainty there may be about some things this much is certain either there is a god or there isnt either there is a revelation or there isnt either man is an agent or he isnt either the soul is immortal or it isnt if the negatives are not sure the affirmatives are possible if the negatives are improbable the affirmatives are probable the more any of your able men finds himself unable to prove any one of these negatives the stronger grounds he has to suspect he may be mistaken so a minute philosopher who wants to act consistently ought to share with the sceptic not merely the sceptics doubts but also his diffidence his modesty and his timidity he shouldnt announce an ocean of light and then lead us to an abyss of darkness if that conduct isnt ridiculous i dont know what ridiculous means as for your ridiculing something that may for all you know be truei cant make any sense of that it isnt acting as a wise man with regard to your own interests or as a good man with regard to the interests of your country cicero says somewhere let us either get rid of religion altogether or retain it altogether if there is a single instance of a people prospering without any religion propose in the british parliament that we change our constitution and live without religion if there is any religion better than christianity propose to the parliament that we introduce that new religion a sceptic is a member of a community just like any other man and he can distinguish good from evil whether natural or political and his knowledge of this distinction should be his guide as a patriot even though he isnt a christian and if he doesnt claim to know even this much he should stop claiming to correct or alter something that he knows nothing about also someone who merely doubts shouldnt behave as if he could demonstrate consider someone who says i find my country in possession of certain tenets namely those of christianity they appear to do good which is why they are encouraged by the legislature they are a main part of our constitution and i dont find that these freethinking innovators can disprove them or substitute things more useful and certain in their place so i shall go along with those tenets out of regard for the good of mankind and for the laws of my country i dont say that this man is a christian but i regard him as a patriot with something that matters as much as christianity does not to inquire is folly but it is even greater folly to condemn without inquiring lysicles seemed heartily tired of this conversation it is now late he said to alciphron and everything is ready for our departure everyone has his own way of thinking and i can no more adopt another mans way of thinking than i can adopt his complexion and facial features alciphron pleaded that they had complied with euphranors conditions for being released from the castle and that they should now be set free and euphranor answered that he had no further claims to makeall he had wanted was to know their tenets epilogue after the philosophers had left i remarked to crito that it was hard to understand how men who are so easy to confute should be so difficult to convince aristotle explains this said crito he says that arguments dont have an effect on everyone but only on those whose minds are prepared by upbringing and habits as land is prepared for seed nichomachean ethics however clear a point is the odds are that it wont be understood by someone whose habits and cast of mind go against it so weak a thing is reason when in competition with inclination i replied that this answer might hold with respect to some people at some times but that it didnt seem satisfactory when applied to inquiring men at a time when reason is so much cultivated and thinking so much in vogue a man who is a keen social observer said crito has said that these days thinking is talked of more than it was in ancient times but practised less and that since the revival of learning men have read much and written much but thought little so that for us thinking closely and soundly is a tiny part of what a learned man does and doesnt figure at all in the activities of the socially polished man the freethinkers it must be admitted parade themselves as thinkers but dont show much exactness in their thinking a lively man and what the world calls a man of sense are often no good at all at thinking the ability to think is not a mere gift of nature but must be improved and perfected by much attention and exercise on very different subjects which means that it requires more time and trouble than todays quickoffthemark men care to takethose are the views of a judicious friend of mine if you arent already sufficiently convinced of their truth you need only look at the dark confused admired writers of this famous sect then youll be able to judge whether those who are led by men whose heads are so wrong can have very good heads of their own take for example spinoza the great leader of our modern unbelievers whose writings contain many schemes and notions that have been much admired and followed in recent years for example undermining religion under the pretence of vindicating and explaining it maintaining that it isnt necessary to believe in christ according to the flesh persuading men that miracles are to be understood only in a spiritual and allegorical sense that vice is not as bad a thing as we are apt to think that men are mere machines impelled by fatal necessity i remarked i have heard spinoza described as a man of close argument and demonstration he did indeed demonstrate replied crito but by his standards anyone could demonstrate anything if a man is allowed the privilege of making his own definitions of common words it will be easy for him to demonstrate conclusions that are true in one sense and false in anothertrue and indeed manifest truisms in his sense but false and indeed seeming paradoxes when the words are taken in their ordinary senses for example let spinoza define natural right to be natural power and he will easily demonstrate that whatever a man can do he has a right to do the folly of this procedure is utterly obvious but our freethinkers who claim to have the lumen siccum are so passionately prejudiced against religion that theyll accept as demonstrations the grossest nonsense and sophistry of weak and wicked writers lumen siccum is latin for dry light it comes from bacons brilliant metaphor the human intellect doesnt burn with a dry light because what the person wants and feels gets pumped into it and these men make so much noise with their thinking reasoning and demonstrating that they prejudice some wellmeaning people against all use and improvement of reason one man saw a neighbour of his ruined by the vices of a freethinking son and acquired such a prejudice against thinking that he wouldnt let his own son read euclid because he had been told that it might teach him to think he was rescued from this by a friend who convinced him that the epidemic was not an outbreak of thinking but merely an unthinking pretence of thinking i know one eminent freethinker who never goes to bed without a gallon of wine in his belly and he always replenishes it before the fumes have left his brain so that he hasnt had one sober thought in the past seven years he adds two more anecdotes reporting disgraceful behaviour by freethinkers then it is strange said crito that such men should parade themselves as freethinkers but its even stranger that other men should be on bad terms with thinking and reasoning because of such pretenders i answered that some good men thought there is an opposition between reason and religion knowledge and faith nature and grace and were led by that to conclude that the way to promote religion is to quench the light of nature and to discourage all rational inquiry i shant comment on the intentions of these men replied crito but surely their notions are very wrong what could dishonour religion more than representing it as an unreasonable unnatural ignorant institution god is the father of all lights natural as well as revealed natural greed is one thing and the natural light is another and you cant argue that because one is bad so is the other similarly you cant argue that because false knowledge is bad that real knowledge is bad also so whatever is said about one of them in the bible is not to be interpreted as having said something about the other i insisted that human learning in the hands of theologians had from time to time created great disputes and divisions in the church just as abstracted metaphysics have always tended to produce disputes among christians as well as other men said crito it should seem that genuine truth and knowledge would calm this mood that makes men sacrifice the undisputed duties of peace and charity to disputable notions after all i said whatever may be said for reason the sceptics and unbelievers of today wont be cured by it i wont dispute that said crito to cure an illness you should consider what produced it if men had reasoned themselves into a wrong opinion one might hope to reason them out of it but thats not how things stand the unbelief of minute philosophers seems to arise from things very different from thought and reason people are often turned into unbelievers by little incidents vanity disgust mood inclination without any help from reason faced with a doctrine whose general tendency one finds disagreeable the mind is prepared to enjoy and improve everything that can possibly be thought to count against it thus someones reason for his unbelief may be the coarse manners of some country curate the polished manners of a great familys chaplain the wit of a minute philosopher a joke a song a tale vice laziness quarrelsomeness and fashion produce minute philosophers and quite a lot of people become minute philosophers through sheer bad temper who can expect such an irrational and capricious thing should yield to reason still it may be worthwhile to argue against such men and expose their fallacies if not for their sake then for the sake of others who might otherwise be swayed by them the most general pretext that looks like a reason is the one that points to the variety of opinions about religion this is a rock for a lazy and superficial mind to sit on and take a rest but a more spirited mind with a sounder way of thinking will stand on it and look around examining and comparing the differing institutions of religion he will want to know of all these which is the most sublime and rational in its doctrines the most venerable in its mysteries most useful in its commands most decent in its worship which creates the noblest hopes and most worthy views he will consider their rise and progress and try to discover which owes least to human arts or arms which flatters the senses and gross inclinations of men which adorns and improves the most excellent part of our nature which has been propagated in the most wonderful manner which has overcome the greatest difficulties or showed the most disinterested not self interested zeal and sincerity in its adherents he will inquire into which squares best with nature and history he will consider which savours of the world and which looks like wisdom from above hell be careful to separate human alloy from anything that is divine and overall he will form his judgment like a reasonable freethinker but instead of taking such a rational course one of those hasty sceptics will conclude straight off that theres no wisdom in politics no honesty in business no knowledge in philosophy no truth in religion and all by the same sort of inference from premises about the numerous examples of folly knavery ignorance and error that are to be met with in the world and because people who know nothing about anything think they are sharpsighted in religion this learned sophism is oftenest levelled against christianity in my opinion if you want to convince an unbeliever who can be brought to reason you should start by clearly convincing him of the existence of a god because it seems to me that a real theist cant be an enemy to the christian religion and that what basically makes someone a minute philosopher is his ignorance or disbelief about gods existence those who are acquainted with the great authors in the minute philosophy presumably dont need to be told this that god exists can be clearly proved and is a proper object of human reason whereas the mysteries of his natureand indeed any other mysteries there are in religioncant possibly be explained and proved by reason it is sufficient if we show that theres nothing absurd or selfcontradictory in our beliefs on those matters and instead of forming hypotheses to explain them use our reason only for answering the objections brought against them but we ought always to distinguish the serious modest honest man of sense who has doubts about religion and behaves like a prudent man in doubt from the minute philosophers those profane and conceited men who insist on trying to convert others to their own doubts when someone of this kind presents himself we should consider what species he belongs to firsthand philosopher secondhand philosopher libertine scorner sceptic each type requires its own special treatment some men are too ignorant to be humble and without humility nothing can be learned but though a man cant be convinced of anything unless he has done some thinking and considering even the most ignorant and thoughtless can sometimes be laughed out of their opinions i once saw a bright woman get the better of two minute philosophers by taking her cue from their predominant claims about themselves to the one who claimed to be the most incredulous man upon earth she remarked that for someone who was credulous enough to trust the most valuable thingshis life and his fortuneto his pharmacist and his lawyer it was absurd to claim to be too incredulous to trust his soul a mere trifle according to him to his parishpriest to the other a nattily dressed dandy who said that he favoured the most unbounded freedom she remarked that he was an absolute slave in matters of dress to him the most important thing in the world while he was earnestly contending for freedom of thinking which was something he never bothered to do there are very few firsthand minute philosophers not enough of them to matter in themselves but their followers who pin their faith on them are numerous and are as confident as they are credulous and they do matter because theres something in the air and manner of these secondhand philosophers that is very apt to disconcert a serious man who believes in argumentits much harder to put up with than the weight of their objections euphranor suggested that it would be greatly to the publics benefit if instead of discouraging freethinking there was erected a dianoetic academy thinktank or seminary for freethinkers provided with quiet rooms and galleries and shady walks and groves where after seven years of silence and meditation a man might become a genuine freethinker and from then on be legally entitled to think what he pleased and have a badge to distinguish him from counterfeits really seriously said crito i think that what the present time needs most is more thinking and that the real cause of whatever is wrong can fairly be attributed to the general neglect of education in those who need it most namely the people of fashion what can be expected when those who have the most influence have the least sense and those who are sure to be followed set the worst example when the young are so uneducated and yet are heard from so much when modesty is regarded as feebleness and a deference to years knowledge religion and laws is regarded as a lack of sense and spirit he evidently means that modesty etc are regarded etc by the young because he goes on such precocious development wouldnt have been valued or encouraged by the wise men of antiquity whose views on this matter are so out of line with the spirit of our times that modern ears im afraid couldnt bear them what im going to say would seem ridiculous to our british youth who are so full of ideas and so boldly in favour of trying out new things and setting their country to rights but i think it will be accepted by men of sense it is this if todays governments would try as an experiment to consider themselves in that old homeric light as pastors of the people whose duty it was to improve their flock they would soon find that this requires a very different kind of upbringing from the modern one and different maxims from those of the minute philosophy if our youth were really accustomed to thought and reflection and an acquaintance with the excellent writers of antiquity wed see the licentious frame of mind commonly called freethinking banished from the presence of gentlemen along with ignorance and bad taste and one reform in how the young are brought up needs special attention as things are men follow vice for the sake of pleasure and fly from virtue because they hate pain so what is needed is for young minds to be formed and accustomed to receive pleasure and pain from proper objects ie to have their inclinations and aversions pointed in the right directions anyone who feels the cursed effects of a wrong upbringingin his mind his health or his fortuneshould ponder this thought there is no better way for you to make amends for what is wrong in yourself than preventing it from being wrong also in your descendants while crito was saying this other guests came in which put an end to our conversation "
