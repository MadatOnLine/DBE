alciphron or the minute philosopher a defence of the christian religion against the socalled freethinkers george berkeley contents first dialogue freethinking and the general good second dialogue the ethics of mandeville third dialogue the ethics of shaftesbury fourth dialogue the truth of theism fifth dialogue the utility of christianity sixth dialogue the truth of christianity seventh dialogue the truth of christianity i want to consider the various things that a freethinker can beatheist libertine fanatic scorner critic metaphysician fatalist scepticbut you shouldnt think that according to me every individual freethinker is all of these all i am saying is that each item on that list characterizes some freethinkers you may think that no freethinker is an atheist it has often been said that although there are admittedly some atheists who claim to be philosophical theorists noone is really an atheist as a matter of philosophical theory i know these things are said but i am well assured that one of the most noted writers against christianity in our times claims to have discovered a demonstration knockdown proof that there is no god if you take the trouble to consult conversation and books to inform yourself about the principles and tenets of our modern freethinkers im sure youll find that every item on my list is true to life i am not writing only against books dont think that the freethinking authors are being misrepresented if every notion of alciphron or lysicles is not found precisely in what the authors have written we can expect that a man in a private conversation will speak more openly than others write to improve on the hints given by authors of books and draw conclusions from their principles whatever they may claim i believe that all those who write either explicitly or by insinuation against the dignity freedom and immortality of the human soul can on that account be fairly accused of unsettling the principles of morality and destroying the means of making men rationally virtuous we can expect from that direction a lot that is harmful to the interests of virtue a certain admired writer has expressed the view that the cause of virtue is likely to suffer less from those who mock it than from those who tenderly nurse it because the nurses are apt to bundle it up too warmly and kill it with excess of care and cherishing and also make it a mercenary thing by talking so much of its rewards i leave it to you to decide whether this is a fair statement of the situation the dialogues are reported in a long letter written to a friend by a fictional gentleman named dionall the names are greek his opening words echo berkeleys situation when composing this work he was in rhode island facing the probable failure of his plan to start a college in bermuda the dialogues however are located in a quietly rural part of england first dialogue monday i was optimistic enough to believe that by now id have been able to send you an agreeable account of the success of the plan that brought me to this remote corner of the country but all i could report are the details of how it went wrong and i prefer instead to entertain you with some amusing incidents that have helped to soothe me during the inevitable and unforeseeable difficulties that i have encountered events are not in our power but we can always make good use even of the worst and i have to admit that the way this affair went and the outcome of it gave me an opportunity for reflections that help to compensate for my great loss of time and my trouble and expense a mind that is free to reflect on its own processes if it doesnt produce anything useful to the world usually manages to entertain itself for the past several months i have enjoyed that kind of freedom and leisure in this distant place far from that great whirlpool of business struggle and pleasure that is called the world and my enjoyment of this peaceful place has been greatly increased by the conversation and good qualities of my host euphranorhes a philosopher and a farmer two roles that are not so inconsistent in nature as you might think from the time he left the university euphranor has lived in this small town where he has a good house with a hundred acres of land adjoining it after the work he has put into improving the land it provides him with a comfortable income he has a good collection of books mainly old ones left to him by a clergyman uncle who brought him up and the business of his farm doesnt hinder him from making good use of it he has read much and thought more his health and strength of body helping him not to become mentally weary he thinks he can carry on his studies better in the field than in his study and his mind is seldom idle while he prunes the trees follows the plough or looks after his flocks in the house of this honest friend i became acquainted with a wealthy and distinguished friend of euphranors named crito his anglican parish church is in our town one sunday last summer when he was dining at euphranors i asked after his guests whom we had seen at church with him the previous sunday they are both well said crito but having dropped in at the church that one time just to see what sort of congregation our parish could provide they had no further curiosity about the church and so chose to stay at home what said euphranor are they presbyterians no replied crito they are freethinkers euphranor who had never met any member of that species or sect of men and knew little of their writings wanted to know what their principles were what system they accepted that is more than i can tell you said crito their writers have different opinions some go further and state their position more openly than others but the best way to learn about the current ideas of the sect is to talk with those who declare themselves to be freethinkers your curiosity could now be satisfied if you and dion would spend a week at my house with these guests of mine who seem very ready to declare and propagate their opinions alciphron is in his forties and is no stranger to men or to books i knew him first when we were both training as lawyers in london when he came into a rich inheritance he gave up his law studies and travelled through the civilized parts of europe after his return he lived among the amusements of london but he began to find them stale and insipid which threw him into a sort of irritable laziness my other guest lysicles pronounced liesuhclees is a near relative of mine he is a quick and clever young gentleman with some general knowledge about bookish matters after he had completed his formal education and seen a little of the world he became friends with men of pleasure and freethinkers berkeleys exact phrase which i fear has greatly harmed his health and his fortune but what i regret most is the corruption of his mind by a set of harmful principles that he wont ever be cured of they have survived the passions of youth so theres no chance of his losing them now these two would be agreeable enough if only they didnt fancy themselves freethinkers because of this frankly speaking they make it a little too obvious that they think themselves wiser than the rest of the world i would like it if my guests met with their match where they least expected it in a country farmer euphranor replied im not offering to do more than merely inform myself about their principles and opinions so tomorrow ill assign my workers their work for a week and accept your invitation if dion is willing i gave my consent meanwhile said crito ill prepare my guests telling them that an honest neighbour would like to talk with them about their freethinking ill be surprised if they dont like the prospect of leaving a convert behind them even in a country village next morning euphranor rose early and spent the morning putting his affairs in order after lunch we took our walk to critos which lay through half a dozen pleasant fields after walking for about an hour we came to critos house which stands in the middle of a beautiful little park at the door we met a servant carrying a small basket of fruit to a grove where he said his master was with his two guests we found the three of them sitting in the shade and after the usual preliminaries for people meeting for the first time euphranor and i sat down by them we chatted about the beauty of this rural scene the fine season of the year and some improvementsnew methods of agriculturethat had been introduced recently in the adjacent county this gave alciphron an opening to remark that the most valuable improvements came latest i wouldnt be much tempted he said to live in a place where men dont have polished manners or cultivated minds however greatly its land has been improved i realised long ago that there is a gradual progress in human affairs the first care of mankind is to satisfy the cravings of nature next they attend to the conveniences and comforts of life but subduing prejudices and acquiring true knowledgethat herculean labourcomes last because it requires the most perfect abilities and all other advantages prepare the way for it right said euphranor alciphron has mentioned our true defect it has always been thought that as soon as we had provided subsistence for the body our next concern should be to improve the mind but the desire for wealth steps between and occupies mens thoughts were told that thought is what distinguishes man from beast to which i add that freedom of thought makes just as much difference between man and man its the noble upholders of this privilege and perfection of human kindthe freethinkers i mean who have sprung up and multiplied in recent yearsto whom we are indebted for all those important discoveries that ocean of light that has broken in and poured through in spite of slavery and superstition euphranor who is a sincere enemy to both slavery and superstition expressed his admiration for the good people who had saved their country from being ruined by them having spread so much light and knowledge over the land he added that he liked the name freethinker and approved of peoples being free thinkers but in his sense of the term every honest inquirer after truth in any age or country was entitled to it so what about this sect that according to alciphron had recently sprung up what were their tenets euphranor wanted to know what were their discoveriesthe ones through which they brought benefits to mankind he would be grateful if alciphron would inform him about all this that will be no trouble replied alciphron because i myself am one of them and some of the most considerable freethinkers are close friends of mine and seeing that euphranor was listening respectfully he went on very fluently the mind of man is like a piece of land what uprooting ploughing digging and harrowing is to the land is what thinking reflecting and examining is to the human mind theres a right way to cultivate each land that is allowed to stay waste and wild for a long time will be choked with brushwood brambles thorns and other plants that are neither useful nor beautiful similarly in a neglected uncultivated mind many prejudices and absurd opinions will sprout up owing their origin partly to the soil itself the passions and imperfections of the mind of man and partly to seeds that happen to have been scattered there by every wind of doctrine that is raised up by the cunning of politicians the eccentricities of pedants the superstition of fools or the dishonesty of priests what can we expect the human mind to be like today after so many ages of being vulnerable to the frauds of dishonest men and the follies of weak ones its prejudices and errorswhat strong deep roots they must have what a hard job it will be to tear them out but this difficult glorious work is what the modern freethinkers are undertaking alciphron paused and looked around his listeners indeed i said a very praiseworthy undertaking people generally think said euphranor that it is praiseworthy to clear and subdue the earth to tame brute animals to provide nourishment for mens bodies and cure their illnesses but what is all this in comparison to the most excellent and useful undertaking of freeing mankind from their errors and improving and adorning their minds these days replied alciphron people are fools enough not to be able to tell their best benefactors from their worst enemies they have a blind respect for those who enslave them and regard their deliverers as dangerous men who want to undermine accepted principles and opinions it would be a pity if such worthy and able men were to meet with any discouragement it seems to me that a man who spends his time in such a laborious impartial search for truth is a better friend to mankind than the greatest statesman or hero the good that they do is confined to a small part of the world and a short period of time whereas a ray of truth can enlighten the whole world and carry on into future ages im afraid the common herd wont soon come to think like you about this but the better sort educated men with good abilities are properly respectful of those who support light and truth no doubt the clergy are always ready to help and applaud your worthy endeavours upon hearing this lysicles could hardly stifle his laughter and alciphron with an air of pity told i see that you dont know what these men are really like surely you must realise that of all men living the clergy are our greatest enemies they would if they could extinguish the light of nature itself turn the world into a dungeon and keep mankind for ever in chains and darkness i never imagined anything like this of our protestant clergy particularly the anglican ones whom i would have expectedgoing by what i have seen of them and their writingsto be lovers of learning and useful knowledge believe me priests of all religions are the same where there are priests there will be priestcraft and where there is priestcraft there will be a persecuting spirit you can depend on them to exercise their full persecutory power against anyone who has the courage to think for himself and who refuses to be hoodwinked and shackled by his reverend leaders those great masters of hairsplitting and jargon have fabricated various systemswhich this is added sarcastically are all equally true and equally important for the world everyone is wedded to his own sect and furiously attacks all those who disagree with it the next sentence speaks of the magistrate a term that will occur several more times in these dialogues it is a kind of shorthand for judges and anyone else who is involved in the enforcement of the law of the land sometimes as on page it seems to cover also lawmakers the chief vices of priests and churchmen all over the world are cruelty and ambition so they do their best to get the upper hand over the rest of mankind and the magistratehaving a joint interest with the priest in subduing confusing and scaring the peopletoo often lends a hand to the church authorities who always think that their authority and possessions arent safe until those whose opinions are different from their own are deprived of their rights including the rights belonging to their social status and even their rights as human beings picture to yourselves a monster or ghost made up of superstition and fanaticism the offspring of statecraft and priestcraft rattling chains in one hand and with the other brandishing a flaming sword over the land and threatening destruction to all who dare to follow the dictates of reason and common sense just think about this and then say if our undertaking isnt dangerous as well as difficult and yet because of the noble ardour that truth inspires our freethinkers are neither overcome by the difficulty nor daunted by the danger in spite of both we have already made so many converts among people of the better sort that we hope to be able eventually to carry all before us beat down the walls of secular and ecclesiastical tyranny break the fetters and chains of our countrymen and restore the original inherent rights liberties and privileges of mankind having said all this in a highly emotional way alciphron paused to get his breath back but nobody answered him euphranor was staring at him mouth open so alciphron went on turning to euphranor he spoke less excitedly the more innocent and honest a man is the more vulnerable he is to being taken in by the plausible claims of other men you have probably encountered writings by our theologians that discuss grace virtue goodness and such matterswritings that are fit to confuse and deceive a simple honest mind but however much they may whitewash their designs they are all basically engaged in the same selfish project i dont deny that among the theologians there may be here and there a poor halfwitted man who means no harm but i dont hesitate to say that all the men of sense among them are fundamentally driven by ambition avarice and vengefulness while alciphron was speaking a servant came to tell him and lysicles that some men who were about to set off for london were waiting to receive their orders so they both got up and went towards the house as soon as they were gone euphranor remarked to crito that he thought the poor gentleman must have been made to suffer greatly because of his freethinking because he seemed to speak with the passion and resentment natural to men who have been treated very badly i dont believe it answered crito in members of his sectie freethinkersi have often noticed two conversational faults namely highflown rhetoric and teasing depending on whether their mood of the moment is tragic or comic sometimes they work themselves into high passions and are then frightened by the ghosts they have created when they are having one of those fits every assistant parson of a little country church is seen as an inquisitor at other times they adopt a sly joking manner using hints and allusions saying little but insinuating much and overall seeming to amuse themselves at the expense of the subject and of their adversaries if you want to know what they really believe youll have to get them to speak up and not to ramble off the topic they tend to go on about being persecuted for freethinking but they have no good reason for this because everyone is perfectly free to think what he pleases i dont know of any persecution in england for opinion intellectual attitude or thought but i suppose that in every country some care is taken to restrain obscene speech and to discourage an outward contempt for what the public holds sacred whatever the persons inward thoughts may be whether this care in england has recently become so excessive as to distress the subjects of this formerly free and easy government whether the freethinkers can fairly complain of any hardship suffered because of conscience or opinion youll be better placed to judge when you hear their account of the numbers progress and notions of their sect im sure they will tell you all this fully and freely provided nobody present seems shocked or offended for in that case they may tone things down out of sheer good manners i am never angry with any man for his opinion said euphranor whether hes a jew turk or idolworshipper he can speak his mind freely to me without fear of offending i would even be glad to hear what he has to say provided he says it in an honest open manner whoever digs in the mine of truth is my fellowlabourer i think but if while i am trying hard he amuses himself by teasing me and flinging dust in my eyes ill soon be tired of him in the meantime alciphron and lysicles having settled their bit of business returned to us lysicles sat down in the same place as before but alciphron stood in front of us with his arms folded and his head leaning on his left shoulder in the posture of a man meditating we sat silent so as not to disturb his thoughts and after two or three minutes he said oh truth oh liberty after which he went on musing at this point euphranor ventured to interrupt him alciphron he said it isnt fair to spend your time in silent soliloquies in this corner of the world we dont often get a chance to have a conversation with learned and wellinformed men and the opportunity you have put into my hands is too valuable for me not to make the best use of it are you then a sincere devotee of truth and can you stand the freedom of a fair inquiry thats what i want more than anything what on every subject on the notions that you first took in with your mothers milk and that have ever since been fed to you by other nursesparents pastors tutors religious assemblies books of devotion and other such devices for taking hold of mens minds i love information on all subjects that come my way and especially on those that are most important well then if you are in earnest stay fair and stand firm while i probe your prejudices and wipe out your principleswhile i pull from your heart your hoary old wives tales he says this in latin quoting the poet persius whereupon alciphron frowned paused and then launched forth if we take the trouble to dig down to the bottom of things and analyse the basic principles on which opinions rest well find that the opinions that are thought to be the most important have the flimsiest bases being derived either from the casual customs of the country where we live or from indoctrination that we were subjected to before we could tell right from wrong true from false alciphron is about the speak of the vulgar and to say what he means by that word broadly speaking its sense at that time was common ordinary runofthemill not very educated not possessed of serious intellectual interestssomething along those lines it didnt have the sense of rude crude badmannered or the like in the present work vulgar is sometimes used as a term of disdain or condescension to refer to people who wouldnt have counted as vulgar is the sober strictly literal sense of the word the vulgarmeaning all the people who dont make a free use of their reasontend to regard these prejudices as sacred and unquestionable believing them to be imprinted on the hearts of men by god himself or conveyed by revelation from heaven or so intrinsically clear and evident that one cant help accepting them without any inquiry or examination in this way the shallow vulgar have their heads full of fancies principles and doctrinesreligious moral and politicalall of which they maintain with a level of energy that is proportional to their lack of reason on the other hand those who properly used their faculties in the search for truth are especially careful to weed out of their minds any notions or prejudices that were planted in them before they were old enough to use reason freely and completely our modern freethinkers have actually done this as well as shrewdly dissecting the generally accepted systems of belief they have traced every established prejudice to its sourcethe real reasons why people believe what they believe and in the course of doing thisand getting a comprehensive overview of the various parts and ages of the worldthey have been able to observe an amazing variety of customs and rites of religious and civil institutions of ideas and beliefs that are very unlike and even contrary to one another which conclusively shows that they cant all be true yet each of them is maintained by its supporters with the same air of confidence the same energetic earnestness and when they are examined they all turn out to have the very same foundationnamely the strength of prejudice with the help of these observations and discoveries they have broken the chains of popular custom and having freed themselves from fraud they now generously lend a hand to their fellowsubjects to lead them into the same paths of light and liberty that is a quick summary of the views and projects of the socalled freethinkers if anything that i have said or anything ill say later is contrary to your preconceived opinions and therefore shocking and disagreeable to you youll pardon the openness and plainness of a philosopher and remember that whenever i displease you in that way i am doing it out of respect for the truth and obedience to your own commands im well aware that eyes long kept in the dark cant bear a sudden view of noonday light and must be brought to it by degrees for that reason the able freethinkers proceed gradually starting with the prejudices to which men are least attached and then moving on to undermine the rest by slow and imperceptible degrees till they have demolished the whole fabric of human folly and superstition but i dont have time here to come at things in that roundabout way ill have to proceed directly and plainlymore so perhaps than will be thought prudent and wellmannered we assured him he was entirely free to speak his mind concerning things persons and opinions without holding anything back that is a freedom alciphron replied that we freethinkers are as willing to give as we are to take it we like to call things by their right names and we cant bear having truth suffer because people politely let falsehoods pass without challenge so let us settle this in advance noone will take offence at anything whatsoever that is said on either side we agreed to this well then said alciphron let us start our pursuit of the truth by supposing that i have been brought up inlets saythe church of england the anglican church when i reach maturity of judgment and think about the particular forms of worship and opinions of this church i dont remember when or how they first took possession of my mind as i look back i find them to have been in my mind for as far back as my memory of anything stretches then looking at the upbringing of children as a basis for a judgment about how my own upbringing went i see them being instructed in religious matters before they can reason about them so that all such instruction is nothing but filling the tender mind of a child with prejudices this leads me to reject all those religious ideas regarding them as on a par with the other follies of my childhood i am confirmed in this attitude when i widen my view and see roman catholics and various sects of protestants which all agree in a general profession of belief in christ but differ vastly one from another regarding details of faith and worship then i widen my view still further so as to take in jews and moslems i see that they agree a little with christiansin that they all believe in one godbut each of these religions has its own special laws and revelations for which it expresses the same respect as the others have for their laws and revelations looking further afield still to examine heathen and idolatrous nations i discover an endless variety not only in details of doctrine and forms of worship but even in the very notion of a god in which they differ widely from one another and from all the other sects i have mentioned the bottom line is that instead of simple and uniform truth i see nothing but discord opposition and wild claims all springing up from the prejudices of upbringing from reflecting on and thinking about these facts thoughtful men have concluded that all religions are falseare fables the reason why one man is a christian another a jew a third a moslem a fourth a heathen idolater is that each happened to be brought up in that particular sect so just as each of these contending parties condemns the rest so an unprejudiced bystander will condemn and reject them en bloc seeing that they all originate from the same errorrich source and are kept going by the same techniques to meet the same purposes of the priest and the magistrate see note on page so you think that the magistrate goes along with the priest in misleading the people i do and so must everyone who considers things in a true light for you must know that the magistrates main aim is to keep the people under him in awe now the public eye restrains men from open offences against the laws and government but to prevent secret crimes a magistrate finds it expedient that men should believe that gods eye is watching over their private actions and designs and to intimidate those who might otherwise be drawn into crimes by the prospect of pleasure and profit he tells them that whoever escapes punishment in this life will be sure to find it in the afterlifewhere it will be so heavy and longlasting that it infinitely outweighs any pleasure or profit that he got from his crimes so it has come about that the beliefs that there is a god the soul is immortal and there is a future state of rewards and punishments have been valued as useful engines of government these are rather notional airy doctrines and the rulers need them to impress themselves on peoples senses and to be retained in their minds and so the rulers of the various civilized nations of the earth have skillfully devised temples sacrifices churches rites ceremonies clerical clothing music prayer preaching and other such spiritual foolery all of which helps the priest to prosper in his career and satisfies the magistrate by frightening and subduing the people thats the source of the alliance between church and state religion established by law and the rights immunities and incomes of priests all over the world every government wants you to fear god so that youll honour the king or civil power crito and i heard this speech of alciphrons with the utmost attention but without looking surprisedand indeed for us there was nothing new or unexpected in it but euphranor who had never before been present at such conversation couldnt help showing some astonishment and lysicles who noticed it asked him brightly how he liked alciphrons lecture i think its the first you ever heard of that kind he said and youll have needed a strong stomach to digest it i admit that i dont have the quickest digestion but it has sometimes gradually been able to assimilate things that at first seemed indigestible right now i admire alciphrons free spirit and eloquence but frankly im astonished by his opinions rather than convinced of their truth what he said turning to alciphroncan you really not believe in the existence of a god to be plain with you i do not but this is what i thought would happen a flood of light let in on the mind all at once is more likely to dazzle and disorder the mind than to enlighten it if i werent short of time i would have begun in the regular way first describing the features of religion that arent essential to it then attacking the mysteries of christianity after that proceeding to what christianity teaches about conduct and finally wiping out the belief in a god this last being the first taught of all the religious prejudices and the basis of the rest so that it has taken the deepest root in our minds im not surprised that you still have this belief this prejudice because i have known a number of very able men who had trouble freeing themselves from it not everyone has the same speed and energy of thinking as you do i for one find it hard to keep up with you to help you ill go back a little and pick up the thread of my reasoning first i must tell you that having thought hard about the idea of truth i have found truth to be stable permanent and uniformnot various and changeable like modes or fashions or matters of taste in the next place having observed many sects and splinters from sects adopting very different and contrary opinions while all professing christianity i rejected any doctrine on which they didnt all agree and kept only the one that was agreed to by all and so i became a latitudinarian roughly someone who is a christian in a broad sense with no interest in the details of doctrine church government forms of worship etc that divide branches of christianity from one another after going on to attend to more of the facts i saw that christians jews and moslems have their different systems of faith agreeing only in the belief that there is one god and so i became a deist roughly someone who rejects miracles revelation anything supernatural and has no interest in any organized church or form of worship but believes that natural evidence points to there being a god lastly i extended my view to all the many nations that inhabit this globe and found that they didnt agreewith one another or with any of the sects i have mentionedon any point of faith not even on the notion of a god so i became an atheist because i think that a man of courage and good sense should follow his argument wherever it leads him and that nothing is more ridiculous than to be a freethinker by halves i approve of the man who does the job thoroughlynot merely lopping off the branches but pulling up the root from which they grew regarding this next bit the grand arcanum was the mythical philosophers stone which was reputed to transform lead into gold andor perform other wonders alciphrons ironical use of the term may be meant to indicate that atheism transforms large parts of ones beliefsystem in berkeleys day calling someone a genius was stronger than merely calling him clever but had less force than genius does in our day so you see that atheismwhich frightens women and foolsis the very peak and perfection of freethinking it is the grand arcanum to which a true genius naturally risesperhaps gradually perhaps as a sudden intellectual breakthroughand without it he can never have absolute freedom and peace in his soul to become thoroughly convinced about this central point just examine the notion of a god with the same freedom that you would examine any other prejudice track it back to its source and you wont find that you acquired it through any of your senses though these are in fact the only true means of discovering what is real and substantial in nature youll find it lying among other old lumber in some obscure corner of your imagination the proper dumpingground for visions fancies and prejudices of all kinds and if you are more attached to this bit of lumber than you are to the rest thats only because it is the oldest that is all take my word for it and not just mine but that of many of the ablest men of our times whose views about god are the same as mine they really are though some of these people think they should go more gently in declaring to the world their opinion on this matter than on most others and i have to admit that in england there are still too many people who retain a foolish prejudice against the label atheist but that is lessening every day among people of the better sort and when itie the prejudice against the word atheisthas faded to nothing our freethinkers can then at last be said to have given the deathblow to religion because its obvious that so long as people think that god exists religion must survive in some shape or other but once the root has been plucked up all its offspring will wither and decay as a matter of course the offspring im talking about are all those whimsical notions of conscience duty principle and the like which fill a mans head with worries awe him with fears and make him more thoroughly a slave than is the horse he rides its a thousand times better to be hunted by debtcollectors or bailiffs with subpoenas than to be haunted by these spectres of conscience etc which trouble and embitter all his pleasures creating the most real and severe slavery on earth but the freethinker with a vigorous flight of thought breaks through those airy traps and asserts his basic independence others may talk and write and fight about liberty and outwardly claim to have it but only the freethinker is truly free when alciphron ended this speech with an air of triumph euphranor said to him you make clear work it seems that the gentlemen who believe as you do are admirable weeders you have rooted up a world of notions now show me what fine things you have planted in place of them be patient euphranor ill show you first that we leave untouched whatever was sound and good encouraging it to grow in the mind of man and secondly ill show you what excellent things we have planted there pushing on with our close and severe scrutiny we eventually arrive at something solid and real on which all mankind agree namely the appetites passions and senses these are rooted in nature are real have real objects and bring with them real and substantial pleasuresfood drink sleep and other such animal enjoyments being what all men like and love and if we extend our view to the other kinds of animals well find that they all have certain natural appetites and senses which they are constantly engaged in gratifying and satisfying we are so far from destroying these real natural good things which have nothing notional or fanciful about them that we do our best to cherish and improve them according to us every wise man regards himselfie his own bodily existence in this present worldas the centre and ultimate end of all his actions and concerns he regards his appetites as natural guides that will direct him to his proper good and regards his passions and senses as the natural true means of enjoying this good so he tries to keep his appetites alert and his passions and senses strong and lively and works very hard in every possible way to provide the greatest quantity and variety of real objects suited to them a man who can do this without restraint remorse or fear is as happy as any other animal whatsoeveras happy as his nature is capable of being there i have given you a condensed view of the principles discoveries and beliefs of the select spirits here the best minds of this enlightened age after a polite little toandfro about the need for open frankness on both sides the discussion continues i am half ashamed said euphranor to admit that i have a weakness that lesser minds are prone to im no great genius i have favourite opinions that you represent as errors and prejudices for instance the immortality of the soul is a notion im fond of because it supports the mind with a very pleasing prospect if it is wrong i might side with cicero who said that in that case he would be sorry to know the truth and speaking of certain philosophers of his time who taught that the human soul was mortal said that he had nothing to thank them for those philosophers seem to have been predecessors of those who are now called freethinkers euphranor goes on to remark that freethinker is too general a name and that he has no objection to thinking freely he proposes that the sect be given the name that cicero gave them with all my heart what name is it why he calls them minute philosophers this is minute small not seconds euphranors point is of course not that these philosophers are small but that they represent valuable things as small or of small importance alciphron will soon suggest a different meaning for the label right said crito the modern freethinkers are just like the ones that cicero called minute philosophers its an excellent name for them because they diminish all the most valuable thingsthe thoughts views and hopes of men they reduce all the knowledge ideas and theories that men have to sense they shrink and downgrade human nature to the narrow low standard of animal life and they assign to us only a small pittance of time instead of immortality alciphron very gravely remarked that the gentlemen of his sect had not insulted man and that if man is a little shortlived negligible animal it wasnt their saying it that made him so and they were no more to blame for whatever defects they reveal in themselves than a good mirror is to blame for making the wrinkles that it shows as for your remark that those we now call freethinkers were in ancient times called minute philosophers i suggest that this label may have come from their considering things minutely rather than swallowing them in great lumps as other men usually do anyway we all know that the best eyes are necessary to pick out the minutest objects so it seems that minute philosophers might have been socalled because they were so sharpsighted o alciphron these minute philosophers that is the right name for them are like pirates who plunder everything that comes in their way i feel like a man who has been left stripped and desolate on a bleak beach but who are these profound and learned men that in recent years have demolished the whole fabric that lawgivers philosophers and theologians had been erecting for so many ages lysicles smiling said he believed euphranor was imagining philosophers in square caps and long gowns and that in these happy times the reign of pedantry was over our philosophers he said are very different from the awkward students who try to get knowledge by poring over dead languages and ancient authors or by shutting themselves off from the cares of the world to meditate in solitude they are the best bred men of the age men who know the world men of pleasure men of fashion and fine gentlemen i have some idea of the people youre talking about but i would never have taken them for philosophers nor would anyone else until quite recently it seems that for centuries everyone mistakenly thought that the way to knowledge was through a tedious course of academic education and study but one of the chief discoveries of the present time is that such a method slows down and blocks knowledge rather than promoting it crito is of course speaking sarcastically he doesnt actually side with the minute philosophers he will keep up this tone until page where he will come into the open his open attacks on the minute philosophy in the second dialogue are the most rhetorically vivid and passionate things that berkeley ever wrote there are two strands in academic study reading and thinking what the students mainly read are ancient authors in dead languages so that much of their time is spent in learning words which once theyve been laboriously mastered reward the scholar with old and obsolete ideas that are now quite exploded and abandoned as for their thinking what good can possibly come of it if someone doesnt have the right materials to think about he can think and meditate for ever without getting anywhere those cobwebs that scholars spin out of their own brains are neither useful nor beautiful theres only one way to get proper ideas or materials of thought and that is by keeping good company i know several gentlemen who since their appearance in the world the nonacademic world or perhaps more narrowly the world of high society and fashion have spent as much time rubbing off the rust and pedantry of a college education as they had first spent acquiring it ill bet that a fourteenyearold who is brought up in the modern way will make a better showing and be more admired in any drawingroom or assembly of cultivated people than a twentyfouryearold who has set aside long time for studies at school and college hell say better things in a better manner and be more liked by good judges where does he pick up all this improvement where our solemn ancestors would never have looked for it in a drawingroom a coffeehouse a tavern a gambling den in fashionable places like these its the custom for cultivated persons to speak freely on all subjectsreligious moral or political so that a young gentleman who spends much time in them is in a position to hear many instructive lectures spiced with wit and teasing and uttered with energy three or four welldelivered sentences from a man of quality make more of an impression and convey more knowledge than a dozen dry academic lectures so theres no method no set course of studies in those places none but an easy free conversation which takes up every topic that anyone offers without any rule or design i always thought that to get any useful amount of knowledge one needed some order in ones studies that haste and confusion create selfsatisfied ignorance that our advances cant be secure unless they are gradual and that one should start by learning things that might cast a light on what was to follow so long as learning could be obtained only by that slow formal course of study few of the better people knew much of it but now that learning has grown into a pastime our young gentry and nobility unknowingly absorb it during their other pastimes and make a considerable progress thats presumably why there are so many minute philosophers crito resumes his sarcastic pretended admiration for the minute philosophers then it would seem then that method exactness and hard work are a positive disadvantage here alciphron turning to lysicles said he could make the point very clear if euphranor had any notion of painting i never saw a firstrate picture in my life but i have a pretty good collection of prints and have seen some good drawings so you know the difference between the dutch and the italian manner i have some idea of it well then compare a drawing done by the exact and laborious touches of a dutch pencil with a drawing casually dashed off in the free manner of a great italian master the dutch piece which has taken so much trouble and time will indeed be exact but it wont have the force spirit or grace that appear in the italian drawing and are the effects of an easy free pencil apply this example to our discussion and youll get my point tell me did those great italian masters begin and continue in their art without any choice of method or subject and always draw with the same ease and freedom or did they conform to some method beginning with simple and elementary partsan eye a nose a fingerwhich they drew with great effort and care often drawing the same thing over and over again so as to get it right and so gradually acquiring through patience and hard work through many years the free masterly manner you speak of if the latter is right i leave you to apply the example to our discussion so that you will get my point dispute the matter if you like but a man of many talents is one thing and a pedant is another hard methodical work may do for some kinds of people it takes a long time to ignite wet straw and when you do you get a vile smothering flame whereas spirits blaze out at once the minute philosophers have it seems better talents than other men which qualifies them for a different education tell me euphranor what does one man get to look good in a way that others dont what causes him to be more polished in how he dresses how he speaks and how he moves nothing but keeping good company that is also how men gradually and unconsciously get a delicate taste a refined judgment a certain polish in thinking and expressing themselves its not surprising that you folk who live out in the country arent acquainted with the advantage of elegant conversation which constantly keeps the mind awake and active making use of its abilities and demanding all its strength and spirit on a thousand different occasions and on subjects that never come in the way of a bookworm in a college any more than a ploughman hence the lively faculties quickness of uptake slyness of ridicule and enormous talent of wit and humour that distinguish the gentlemen who believe as you do it should seem then that your sect is made up of what you call fine gentlemen not altogether for we have among us some thoughtful people whose upbringing was coarser but though they cant be called fine gentlemen they have made fine contributions to our cause having observed the behaviour of apprentices watermen porters and the gatherings of rabble in the streets they have arrived at a profound knowledge of human nature and made great discoveries about the sources springs and motives of moral actions the phrase moral actions standardly meant actions that do or could involve consciously held reasons or purposes these discoveries have demolished the accepted systems of morality and done a world of good in the city we have men of all sorts and professionsplodding citizens thriving stockbrokers skillful men of business elegant courtiers gallant men of the armybut our chief strength comes from those promising young men who have the advantage of a modern education these are the growing hopes of our sect through their influence we expect the great things we have in view will be actually accomplished i would never have thought your sect was so considerable many honest folk in england are as much in the dark about these matters as you are it would be wrong to infer what the prevailing opinion among people of fashion is from what is said by a legislator in parliament a judge on the bench or a priest in the pulpit they all speak according to law ie according to the reverend prejudices of our forefathers you should go into good company and take note of what able and wellbred men say those who are most listened to and most admired in public gatherings as well as in private conversations only someone who has these opportunities can know our real strength our numbers and the impression we make on the world by your account there must be many minute philosophers among the men of rank and fortune a good many and they contribute greatly to the spreading of our notions anyone who knows the world has to know that fashions always come from above so the right way to propagate an opinion is to start at the upper end of society also the patronage of men of rank and fortune is an encouragement to our authors so you have authors among you we do indeed a number of them and they are very great men who have favoured the world with many useful and profound discoveries he is now laying on really thick his sarcastically intended rhetoric in favour of the minute philosophers he will soon drop it altogether the proper names in this speech refer to real people the device of giving ones targets ancientsounding names was a common practice in polemical writing at that time moschon for instance has proved that man and beast are really of the same nature and that consequently a man needs only to indulge his senses and appetites to be as happy as a brute gorgias has gone further demonstrating that man is a piece of clockwork a machine and that thought or reason are the same thing as the collision of balls cimon has made distinguished use of these discoveries proving as clearly as any proposition in mathematics that conscience is a whim and morality a prejudice and that a man is no more accountable for his actions than a clock is for striking what tryphon has written about the usefulness of vice cant be refuted thrasenor has destroyed the foolish prejudice men had against atheism showing that a republic of atheists might live very happily together demylus has made a joke of loyalty and convinced the world that theres nothing in it we owe to him and to another philosopher of the same type the discovery that public spirit is a pointless fanaticism that seizes only on weak minds i could go on indefinitely reciting the discoveries made by writers of this sect but the masterpiece and coup de grace for the old system is a learned work by our great diagoras containing a demonstration of the nonexistence of god it hasnt yet been published because the public are thought to be not yet ripe for it but im assured by some judicious friends who have seen it that its as clear as daylight and will do a world of good by demolishing at one blow the whole system of religion these discoveries are published by our philosophers sometimes in bound books but often merely in pamphlets and loose pages making it easier for them to be spread through the kingdom they deserve the credit for the absolute and independent freedom that is growing so fast and frightening the bigots even dull and ignorant people start to open their eyes and to be influenced by the example and authority of so many able men it should seem by this accountor rather by what crito last saidthat your sect extend their discoveries beyond religion and that the minute philosopher regards loyalty to his king and reverence for the laws as lowdown things very lowdown we are too wise to think there is anything sacred about the king or the constitution or indeed about anything else a man of sense may seem to show an occasional deference to his king but thats as hollow as his deference to god when he kneels at the sacrament so as to qualify himself for an office government job fear god and honour the king are two slavish maxims that had for a long time cramped human nature and awed not only weak minds but even men of good understanding until their eyes were opened by our philosophers its easy to see that when the fear of god is quite extinguished the mind must take a relaxed attitude to other duties as soon as those other duties lose their hold on the conscience which always presupposes the existence of a god they become mere outward pretences and formalities but i still thought that englishmen of all schools of thought however much they may differ on many details agreed in the belief in god and accepted at least the propositions of socalled natural religion i have already told you my own opinion on those matters and what i know to be the opinion of many others i think i know what has led you astray euphranor the minute philosophers are sometimes called deists see note on page which has led you to imagine that they believe in and worship a god according to the light of nature but if you live among them youll soon be convinced of the contrary they have neither time nor place nor form of divine worship they dont offer prayers or praises to god in public and in their private lives they show a disregard or dislike even of the duties of natural religion for example saying grace before and after meals this is a plain point of natural worship and there was a time when everyone did it but in proportion as this sect of minute philosophers prevailed it has been laid aside not only by the minute philosophers themselves but also by others who are afraid of being thought fools by the minute philosophers are you really saying that men who genuinely believe in a god decline to perform such an easy and reasonable duty for fear of being sneered at by atheists yes i am many people who believe in their hearts the truth of religion are afraid or ashamed to admit it lest they should lose their standing in the eyes of those who have the good luck to be regarded as great wits and men of genius we must make allowance for critos prejudice euphranor he is a worthy gentleman and means well but doesnt it look like prejudice to ascribe the respect that is paid our ingenious freethinkers to good luck rather than to merit im sure their merit is very wonderful it would take a great man to prove such paradoxeseg that someone as knowledgeable as a minute philosopher should be a mere machine or at best no better than a brute it is a true maxim that a man should think with the learned and speak with the vulgar berkeley had already famously said this in his principles of human knowledge regarding the vulgar see note on page i would be very reluctant to describe a gentleman of merit as a machine to an audience of prejudiced and ignorant men the doctrines of our philosophy have something in common with many other truths in metaphysics geometry astronomy and natural science namely that vulgar ears cant bear them all our discoveries and ideas are in themselves true and certain but they are at present known only to the better people and would sound strange and odd among the vulgar its to be hoped that this will eventually wear off im not surprised that vulgar minds should be startled by the ideas of your philosophy truly a very curious sort of philosophy and much to be wondered at the deep thinkers in the minute philosophy camp have gone in exactly the opposite way to all the great philosophers of earlier ages who tried to raise and refine humanity removing it as far as possible from the brute to moderate and subdue mens appetites to remind men of the dignity of their nature to awaken and improve their higher faculties and direct them onto the noblest objects to fill mens minds with a high sense of god of the supreme good and of the immortality of the soul but our minute philosophers seem to go the opposite way from all other wise and thoughtful men because they aim to erase from the mind of man the sources of all that is great and good to disrupt the order of civil life to undermine the foundations of morality and to bring us down to the maxims and way of thinking of the most uneducated and barbarous nations and even to pull humanity down to the level of brute beasts and through all this they want to be accepted by the world as men of deep knowledge but all this negative knowledgedoes it come down to anything better than downright savage ignorance that there is no god no spirit no afterlife no moral duty truly a fine system for an honest man to accept or for a clever man to be proud of alciphron who heard this discourse with some uneasiness very gravely replied disputes are not to be decided by the weight of authority he said but by the force of reason call our notions brutish and barbarous if you please but its a kind of brutishness and barbarism that few people would be capable of if men of the greatest genius hadnt cleared the logjam because theres nothing harder than to overcome ones upbringing and conquer old prejudices it takes great courage and great strength of faculties to pick out and cast off a heap of rubbish that has been gathering in the soul from our very infancy so our philosophers thoroughly deserve to be called esprits forts men of strong heads freethinkers and so on labels that indicate great strength and freedom of mind the heroic labours of these men may be represented for anything can be misrepresented as piratically plundering and stripping the mind of its wealth and ornaments when really they are only divesting it of its prejudices and reducing it to its untainted original state of naturebeautiful pure nature you seem to be impressed by the beauty of nature please alciphron tell me what the things are that you regard as natural how are we to recognize something as natural for a thing to be natural to the mind of man to start with that special case it must appear in the human mind originally from the outset from birth be present universally in the minds of all men and be invariably the same in all nations and ages these threeoriginalness universality invariability exclude all the notions that humans have as results of custom and upbringing this also holds for all other species of beings a cats inclination to pursue a mouse is natural because it satisfies the above three criteria but if a cat is taught to play tricks you wont say that the tricks are natural for the same reason if peaches and apricots are grafted onto a plumtree nobody will say they are the natural growth of that tree lets get back to the human case it seems that the only things youll count as natural in mankind are ones that show themselves at the time of a persons first entrance into the worldnamely the senses and such passions and appetites as reveal themselves as soon as their respective objects appeareg hunger when there is milk fear when there is a loud noise and so on that is my opinion qa note euphranor now asks alciphron seven rhetorical questions to the first six of which alciphron gives the expected answers including it seems so i do and it is true to spare us the tedious questionandanswer routine the questions will appear here as simple statements with the first six answers omitted this condensing device will be used on fourteen other occasions each marked by four or more statements by euphranor labelled with roman numerals and a mention of this note i the leaves blossom and apples of an apple tree are natural to it although it doesnt have them from the outset ii the appetite of lust and the faculty of reason are natural to a man even though they dont shoot forth open and display themselvesas leaves and blossoms do in a treeuntil long after his original infancy iii so it seems that you were being rash when you said that the first criterion for somethings being natural to the mind was that it should appear in it originally iv also it is natural for an orange tree to produce oranges v but if you plant such a tree at the north end of great britain you may if you work hard at it get a good salad ie leaves but no fruit in the southern parts of the island hard careful work may get it to produce mediocre fruit but in portugal or naples it will produce much better fruit with little or no trouble on the part of the farmer vi the plant is the same in all these places but it doesnt produce the same fruit sun soil and cultivation make a difference vii and since according to you its the same story for every species cant we conclude that some things may be natural to mankind although they are not found in all men and arent invariably the same where they are found hold on euphranor you must explain yourself further i shant be rushed into conceding your points youre right to be wary alciphron i dont like these ensnaring questions i dont want you to go along with me out of politeness just tell me what you think about each particular matter so that we understand one another know what we agree on and proceed together in finding out the truth our opinions will stand the test we fear no trial proceed as you please see qa note on page i we seem to have found that things may be natural to men without actually being on display in all men or not as completely on display because differences of culture and other advantages affect what comes of human nature as much as they do with the nature of plants i am using your own comparison ii men at all times and places when they arrive at a certain age express their thoughts by speech iii so it seems that language is natural iv yet there is a great variety of languages v from all this it follows that a thing may be natural and yet admit of variety vi it seems to follow that a thing may be natural to mankind without having the marks of naturalness that you presentie without being original universal and invariable vii consequently religious worship and civil government may be natural to man despite the fact that they occur in a variety of forms and in different degrees of perfection viii you have granted already that reason is natural to mankind ix so whatever is agreeable to reason is agreeable to the nature of man x doesnt it follow from this that truth and virtue are natural to man whatever is reasonable i admit to be natural the fruits that we value most are the ones that come from the most strongly growing and mature stock in the choicest soil similarly then oughtnt we to value most the sublime truths that are the fruits of mature thought and have been rationally deduced by men with the best and most developed minds and if this is right and these things are in fact reasonable natural and true they oughtnt to be written off as unnatural whims errors of upbringing and groundless prejudices just because they are raised and developed by manuring and cultivating young human minds ie because they take root early and bring forth early fruit through the care and diligence of our instructors agreed provided that they can still be rationally deduced but to take for granted that what men vulgarly call the truths of morality and religion have a rational basis would be begging the question he means that it would be in effect including the conclusion of ones argument amongst its premises that was the only meaning of beg the question until late in the th century when the vulgarspecifically the ones working as journalistslearned the phrase and assumed that it meant raise the question youre right about that so i dont take for granted that the truths of morality and religion are rationally deduced i only suppose that if they are then they must be regarded as natural to manie that they fit with and grow from the most excellent part of human nature the part that other natural species dont have i have no objection to bring against this then what are we to think of your former assertions i mean your claims that anything that is natural to man can be found in all men in all nations and ages of the world and that to obtain a genuine view of human nature we must set aside all the effects of upbringing and instruction and look only at the senses appetites and passions that are to be found originally in all mankind and that therefore the notion of a god cant be based in nature because it isnt originally in the mind and isnt the same in all men how do you reconcile these opening statements of yours with your recent concessionsones that the force of truth seems to have extorted from you tell me euphranor isnt truth a single uniform invariable thing and if it is isnt the existence of the many different and mutually inconsistent notions that men have of god and duty a plain proof there is no truth in them i freely grant that truth is constant and uniform so that two opinions that contradict one another cant both be true but it doesnt follow that they are both false when there are conflicting opinions about the same thing the one if there is one that is grounded on clear and evident reasons should be regarded as true and others accepted only to the extent that they are consistent with that privileged one reason is the same at all times and places and when it is used properly it will lead to the same conclusions two thousand years ago socrates seems to have reasoned himself into the same notion of a god that is entertained by the philosophers of our days if youll allow someone who isnt a freethinker to be called philosopher and consider confuciuss remark that a man should be on guard in his youth against lust in manhood against quarrelsomeness and in old age against greedthis morality is as current in europe as in china but when opinions differ that shows that there is uncertainty so it would be good if all men thought the same way what do you think to be the cause of a lunar eclipse the earths coming between the sun and moon making a shadow on the moon are you sure of this certainly are all mankind agreed in this truth by no means ignorant and barbarous people give different ridiculous explanations for this phenomenon so it seems that there are different opinions about the nature of an eclipse there are yet one of these opinions is true it is thus when there are conflicting opinions about something it may still be the case that the thing exists and one of the opinions about it is true i accept that well you argued from the variety of opinions about gods nature to the falsity of the opinion that he exists and now it seems that this argument is not conclusive and i dont see either how you can infer the falsity of any moral or religious tenet from mens conflicting opinions on the same subject isnt arguing like that on a par with arguing that no historical account of a matter of fact can be true if reports of it conflict with one another or arguing that because the various schools of philosophy maintain different opinions none of them can be in the rightnot even the minute philosophers during this conversation lysicles seemed uneasy like someone who profoundly wanted there to be no god alciphron he said i think you are sitting tamely on the sidelines while euphranor undermines the foundation of our tenets dont be afraid replied a skillful player of a game sometimes ruins his adversary by giving him some advantage at first i am glad he said turning to euphranor that youre willing to argue and make your appeals to reason for my part i shant be afraid to follow wherever reason leads so let me say this openly i freely concede the points you have been contending for i dont value the success of a few crude notions thrown out in a casual conversation any more than the turks care about the loss of the rubbishinfantry that they position at the front of their armies so as to waste the gunpowder and blunt the swords of their enemies i have kept a good half of my arguments in reserve and i am ready to bring them forward i will undertake to prove i dont doubt your ability to prove alciphron but before i put you to the trouble of any more proofs id like to know whether the notions of your minute philosophy are worth proving i mean whether they are useful and helpful to mankind as to that let me tell you a thing can be useful to one mans views and not to anothers but truth is truth whether or not its useful and it mustnt be evaluated by whether it is convenient for this or that man or sect but isnt the general good of mankind to be regarded as a rule or guide to evaluation of moral truths indeed of all truths that direct or influence the moral actions see note on page of men its not clear to me that that is right i know of course that legislators theologians and politicians have always maintained that it is necessary for the wellbeing of mankind that men should be kept in awe by the slavish notions of religion and morality but even if you are right about what is convenient or helpful how does that prove these moral notions to be true convenience is one thing and truth is another so a real philosopher will set aside all advantages and consider only truth itself tell me alciphron is your real philosopher a wise man or a fool without question hes the wisest of men as between someone who acts with design and someone who acts at random which should we regard as the wiser the one who acts with design see qa note on page well then i whoever acts with design acts for some end ii and a wise man acts for a good end iii and he shows his wisdom in his choice of means to the end he aims at iv and so the more excellent the pursued end is and the more appropriate the chosen means to it are the wiser the person should be thought to be now v a rational agent cant aim at a more excellent end than happiness vi of good things the greater good is most excellent vii the general happiness of mankind is a greater good than the private happiness of one man or of some particular class of men viii so the general happiness of mankind is the most excellent end ix so those who pursue this end by the most appropriate methods should be regarded as the wisest men x a wise man is governed by wise notions rather than foolish ones xi it seems to follow that someone who promotes the general wellbeing of mankind by the proper necessary means is truly wise and acts on wise grounds xii furthermore folly is the opposite of wisdom xii so mightnt we infer that men who try to dislodge principles that have a necessary connection with the general good of mankind are foolish perhaps this might be granted but at the same time i have to say that it is in my power to deny it what you admit the premises so surely you wont deny the conclusion i want to know what the rules are for our debate in this process of question and answer if a man makes a slip is he allowed to recover for if you are on the lookout for every advantage that you can snatch without allowing for surprise or inattention on my part i have to tell you that this is not the way to convince me of your views im not aiming at triumph alciphron all i want is truth so its completely open to you to unravel all that has been said and to correct any slip you have made but then you must point it out clearly otherwise we cant ever arrive at any conclusion i am also sincerely devoted to truth and agree with you on these terms to proceed together in search of it in the course of our present inquiry i think i slipped when i acknowledged that the general happiness of mankind is a greater good than the particular happiness of one man in fact the individual happiness of each man alone constitutes his own entire good the happiness of other men is not a part of my happiness so from my standpoint it isnt a goodi mean a true natural good so it cant be a reasonable end for me to aim at because no wise man will pursue an end that doesnt concern him i am talking about true natural ends not the ends one might announce as political pretences this is the voice of naturethe fountain source and pattern of all that is good and wise so would you like to follow nature and accept her as a guide and as a pattern for you to imitate i want that more than anything where do you get this respect for nature from from the excellence of its productions for example you say that there is usefulness and excellence in a plant because its many parts are connected and fitted to each other in such a way as to protect and nourish the whole plant make the individual grow and propagate the species and also because we get pleasure and benefit from itgrapes from a vine shade or timber from an oak just so similarly dont you infer the excellence of animal bodies from observing the structure and fitness of their many parts which enables the parts to work together for the wellbeing of each other as well as of the whole animal dont you also notice a natural union and cooperation between animals of the same species and that even animals of different species have certain qualities and instincts through which they contribute to the exercise nourishment and delight of each other even inanimate inorganic materials seem to have an excellence relative to each other why would water be excellent if it didnt cause herbs and vegetables to spring from the earth and put forth flowers and fruit and what would become of the beauty of the earth if it werent warmed by the sun moistened by water and fanned by air note the four elements of ancient greek philosophy throughout the whole system of the visible and natural world dont you see a mutual connection and correspondence of parts and isnt that the basis for your idea of the perfection and order and beauty of nature i accept all this now didnt the stoics who were no more bigots than you are sayand didnt you say a few minutes ago that this pattern of natural order is one that rational agents ought to imitate i dont deny that this is true so oughtnt we infer the same union order and regularity in the moral world that we see in the natural world we ought shouldnt it seem to follow from this that reasonable creatures were made for one another and consequently that a man who wants live according to nature ought to consider himself not as an independent individual whose happiness is unconnected with the happiness of others but rather as the part of a whole for whose common good he ought work together with the other parts ie other men supposing this to be true what then wont it follow that a wise man should consider and pursue his own private good in the light of and in combination the good of other menyou granted this point but later said that that was a slip indeed the point doesnt need a fancy argument by me because it has always been seen to be clearly proved by how we feel for one anothers pain and pleasure and by the mutual affections by which mankind are knit together and because it was the constant doctrine of those who were thought the wisest and most thoughtful men among the ancientsplatonists aristotelians and stoicsnot to mention christians whom you pronounce to be an unthinking prejudiced sort of people i shant dispute this point with you well then since we are in agreement up to here shouldnt it seem to follow from the premises that if the beliefs in a god a future state and moral duties are necessarily connected with the wellbeing of mankind then those beliefs are the only wise right and genuine sources of human conduct you have been led to this conclusion by your own concessions and by the analogy of nature ie by the thesis that human conduct ought to fall into patterns that natural events do fall into i have been drawn into it step by step through many preliminaries and i cant now remember them all clearly but i would point out that you rely on the thesis that those religious and moral principles are necessarily connected with the wellbeing of mankindand thats something that you havent proved and i havent granted berkeleys text like this version of it leaves unclear what direction of necessary connection in question either a the beliefs in god etc inevitably contribute to human wellbeing or b without them human wellbeing is impossible i think its a great big fundamental prejudice and if i had time i could show you that thats what it is but its late now shall we put off this subject till tomorrow with that we put an end to our conversation for that evening second dialogue tuesday in the original work though not in this version this dialogue is the secondtolongest of the set its not very interesting philosophically and a connected fact in it the freethinking side is upheld only by lysicles with alciphron silent throughout next morning alciphron and lysicles said that the weather was so fine that they would like to spend the day outside having a picnic meal under a shade in some pleasant part of the countryside so we went to a nearby beach and walked on the sands until the sun became too hot to be comfortable we then went in among the trees and sat down and immediately lysicles addressed himself to im now ready to make good on my undertaking to show there is nothing in the necessary connection that some men imagine there to be between the principles you are defending and the public good if the question were to be decided by the authority of legislators or philosophers of course it would go against us thats because those men generally take it for granted that vice is harmful to the public and that the only way to keep men from vice is through their fear of god and their sense of an afterlife from which they infer that the belief in such things is necessary to the wellbeing of mankind this false notion has held sway for centuries and has done an infinite amount of mischief it has been the real cause of religions being established within states and of the way laws and magistrates have protected and encouraged the clergy and their superstitions even some of the wisest ancient philosophersones who agreed with our sect in denying the existence of a god and the immortality of the soulwere weak enough to accept the common prejudice that vice is hurtful to human societies but england has recently produced great philosophers who have undeceived the world and conclusively shown that private vices are public benefits this was the subtitle of mandevilles notorious fable of the bees lysicles will now devote about a page to presenting arguments taken from mandeville it wasnt until now that this discovery was made and our sect of freethinkers has the glory of it back to sarcasm it may be that some men with fine intellects did in former ages have a glimpse of this important truth but probably they lived at ignorant times and in bigoted countries that werent ripe for such a discovery men of few talents and short sight being able to see no further than one link along a chain of consequences are shocked at small evils that come with vice but those who can take in more and look along a lengthy series of events can see thousands of examples of happiness resulting from vice and of good growing out of evil i shant trouble you with authoritative writers or elaborate arguments lets just look at some plain matters of fact take each particular vice and track it through all its effects and consequences and you clearly see the advantage it brings to the public drunkenness for instance is a harmful vice according to your sober moralists but thats because they didnt take into account the good effects that flow from it lysicles goes on to describe some of these for vulgar drunkenness income from a tax on malt and employment for many different kinds of workers in the beer industry for drunkenness caused by wine and spirits admittedly that sends money into foreign countries but it creates employment in the home countryvastly increased and proliferated by the need for ships then there are all the trades involved in making things that ships export to pay for the wine and spirits and every trade is supported by and supports yet further trades so that theres no end to the good that comes from drunkenness then equally stupidly your halfwitted folk are given to condemning gaming here playing cards for money on the face of it cardplaying seems to be a very idle and useless occupation but if you dig down below the face of it youll see that this idle pastime employs the cardmaker who provides work for the papermills which support the poor man who collects discarded rags not to mention the workers who are employed in building and equipping those mills look still deeper and youll find that candles to light the games and the hiring of sedanchairs to take the players to the game employ the industrious and the poor in this way they are helped by cardsharpers and gentlemen who wouldnt give a penny in charity you may object that many gentlemen and ladies are ruined by gaming but if you do you arent taking into account that what one man loses another gets so that as many are enriched as are ruined money changes hands thats what the life of business and commerce consists inthe circulation of money when money is spent the public doesnt care who spends it suppose an upperclass fool is cheated by a very lowbred fellow who has more brainswhat harm does this do to the public poverty is relieved ingenuity is rewarded the money stays at home you may object that a man made poor by gaming may resort to some desperate conduct that will be hurtful to the public lysicles goes on to speak of the good a highwayman can do mainly by spending extravagantly during his short and merry life but also through the reward that may go to a poor family that turns him in to the police my topic was gaming which smoothly led me to the advantages of highway robbery oh the beautiful and neverenoughadmired connection of vices it would take too long to show how they all hang together and what an infinite amount of good arises from each of them ill add just a few words now on a favourite vice then ill leave you to work out the rest of the story for yourselfive shown you how consider a poor girl who doesnt have what you would call an honest halfcrown a week to spend she has the good luck to become someones kept mistress and immediately she employs milliners laundresses dressers fabricsellers and a number of other trades all to the benefit of her country we could go on for ever tracking every particular vice through its consequences and effects showing the vast advantage they all bring to the public the true springs that drive the great machine of commerce and make the state flourish have been little understood until now your moralists and theologians have long been corrupting the genuine sense of mankind filling mens heads with absurd principlesso long and so absurd that few men now can look at life with an unprejudiced eye and fewer still have the talents and intelligence to pursue a long chain of consequences relations and dependences which is what you must do if you want to form a sound and complete notion of the public welfare oh said euphranor who had listened to this speech very attentively you are the very man i wanted lysicles eloquent and able wellinformed about the principles of your sect and willing to impart them to others tell me is it easy to get these principles accepted in the world it is easy among very able men and people of fashion though youll sometimes meet with strong prejudices against them in people of the middle sort an effect of ordinary talents and low breeding id be surprised if men were not shocked at such surprising notions so contrary to all laws education and religion theyd have been even more shocked if it hadnt been for the skillful writing style of our philosophers knowing that most men are influenced by names rather than by things they have introduced a certain cleanedup way of speaking which lessens much of the revulsion and prejudice against vice explain this for me well in our dialect an immoral man is a man of pleasure a cardsharper is one who plays the whole game an adulterous lady is said to have an affair an adulterous gentleman is said to be gallant a rogue in business is said to be one who knows the world by this means we have no such things as drunkards womanisers whores or rogues in the fashionable world whose inhabitants can enjoy their vices without having nasty labels attached to them so it seems that vice is a fine thing with an ugly name be assured it is plato was afraid that young people might be corrupted by the myths that represent the gods as vicious according to you it seems that attitude was an effect of his weakness and ignorance it was take my word for it yet plato had kept good company and lived in a court and cicero who knew the world well had a deep respect for him plato and cicero may have looked good in ancient athens or rome but if they returned to life today they would be regarded as underbred pedants at most coffeehouses in london there are several able men who could convince plato and cicero that they knew nothing about morals and politicsthe very topics that they are valued so much for not the most sharpwitted of men lysicles hasnt picked up the note of sarcastic scorn in what crito has just said i know ever so many shrewd men both in royal court circles and in the business parts of the city who have five times platos sense and dont care in the slightest what notion their sons have of god or virtue i can illustrate this doctrine of lysicles by two examples that will make you perceive its force the examples are fictional in the first a minute philosopher turns his son into a member of that sect which leads to the sons murdering him and then squandering his estate until he goes bankrupt in the second a minute philosopher converts his wife to his way of thinking he rightly thinks this will stop her from giving to charity and this leads her to adopt an extravagant way of life including playing cards for high stakes thus using up most of her husbands wealth in each case crito recites the mandevillean public benefits of the behaviour in question the murderous sons recklessness spreads his inherited wealth more widely than his miserly father ever would have done the extravagant wife through her gaming transferred a considerable share of her husbands fortune to a number of sharpwitted men who needed it more and circulated it faster than her husband would have done crito maintained a straight face while he told these stories but i couldnt help smiling which lysicles noticed superficial minds he said may find something to ridicule in these accounts but anyone who is really competent in rational thinking must see that a wise commonwealth ought to encourage maxims that bring benefit to everyone and do harm only to particular private persons or families speaking for myself said euphranor i declare that im dazzled and bewildered rather than convinced by your reasoning as you yourself pointed out it takes a great deal of thought to grasp the connections of many distant points soplease put up with my slowness and allow me to take to pieces something that is too big to be taken in all at once and when i cant match your speed allow me to follow you step by step as fast as i can that is reasonable its not everyone who can all in one swoop take in a long chain of argument see qa note on page i your various arguments seem to centre on this vice circulates money and promotes industry which causes a people to flourish ii and vice produces this effect by causing extravagant consumption which is the most beneficial to the manufacturers giving them a quick demand and high price iii so you think that a drunkard because he drinks more than other men brings more benefit to the brewer and the vintner than other men do iv a healthy man drinks more than a sick man v a sober man is healthier than a drunkard so vi a sober man in good health may drink more than a drunkard when he is sick vii a man will consume more meat and drink in a long life than in a short one viii so a sober healthy man may in a long life circulate more money by eating and drinking than a glutton or drunkard circulates in a short life what of it well it seems that the sober healthy man may be more beneficial to the publici mean beneficial through how he eats and drinksthan the glutton or the drunkard is youll never get me to agree that temperance is the way to promote drinking but you will agree that sickness lessens drinking and that death puts an end to it the same argument will hold so far as i can see for every vice that harms mens health and shortens their lives and if that is so the public benefits of vice wont be so sure granted some makers or traders might be as well encouraged by the sober men as the vicious what about the ones whose livelihood depends entirely on vice and vanity if there are people like that couldnt they be employed in some other way without loss to the public tell me lysicles is there anything in the nature of vice in itself that makes it a public blessing or is it only the consumption it causes i have already shown how it benefits the nation by the consumption of things the nation manufactures and you have agreed that a long and healthy life consumes more than a short and sickly one and you wont deny that many consume more than one you do the math which is more likely to promote the industry of his countrymen a virtuous married man with healthy children of his own who also feeds and clothes the orphans in his neighbourhood or a fashionable looseliving man about town doesnt innocently spent money circulate as well as money spent on vice and if it does so doesnt your line of thought imply that innocent activities benefit the public as much as vicious ones what i have proved i proved clearly and nothing more needs to be said about it i cant see that you have proved anything unless you can show that it is impossible to spend a fortune innocently id have thought that the public welfare of a nation consists in the number and good condition of its inhabitants have you anything to object to this i think not which would contribute more to this end employing men in outdoor manly exercise or employing them in sedentary business within doors the former i suppose doesnt it seem to follow that building gardening and agriculture would employ men more usefully to the public than if tailors barbers perfumers distillers and the like were multiplied agreed but this goes against you because what incites men to build and plant is vanity and vanity is a vice but if a man were to build and plant meaning to employ people to build and plant for his convenience or pleasure in proportion to his fortune without foolish ostentation and without exaggerating the value of his house and garden they wouldnt be the effect of vice and how do you know that this cant happen the economic argument about whether and to what extent private vices are public benefits continues through many not very interesting pages with lysicles continuing to be stubborn and continuing not to understand the spirit in which crito extravagantly supports the minute philosophers positioneg talking of all the good that had been done by the fire in london and the injustice done to a freethinker who in a purely principled way murdered his father and was hanged for it they discuss a little the question of whether it is dangerous to publish such views the answer being that it is safe on the antireligious side of the minutephilosophy doctrine less so on the provice legal and political side lysicles says that he wants the whole governmental and legal structure overhauled in the light of the provice principles that freethinkers have discovered then you are it seems in favour of bringing about a thorough reformation as for what is commonly called the reformation i could never see how the world was the better for it protestantism is much the same as popery except for being more prudish and disagreeable a noted writer of ours calculates that the benefit of hooped petticoats is nearly equal to the benefit of the reformation but i think he is flattering it coming back to your question thorough reformation is thorough liberty leave nature absolutely free to work her own way and all will be well thats what we aim at our principles wont let us settle for less crito is a zealous protestant and when he heard lysicles passing jab at the reformation he couldnt refrain from joining in speaking his own mind rather than parodying the freethinkers the worst effect of the reformation he said was that it rescued wicked men from a darkness that had kept them in awe this has turned out to be holding out light to robbers and murderers and the light brought by the reformation may have done harm in another way too namely by encouraging freethinking it didnt have to do that light in itself is good and the light that shows a man the folly of popish superstition might also show him the truth of protestant religion and the madness of atheism but some people have used the light only to see the evils on one side roman catholicism and to run blindly into the arms of the worse evils of the opposite extreme atheism that was to make the best of things produce evil in the way that you show the worst things producing goodnamely accidentally or indirectly lysicles was a little disconcerted by critos emphatic tone but after a short pause he replied briskly that not everyone has the talent to think about the public good true said euphranor i also think that not everyone can frame a notion of the public good much less make good judgments about how to promote it but you lysicles who are a master of this subject please tell me doesnt the public good of a nation imply the particular good of its individuals it does and doesnt the good or happiness of a man consist in his having both soul and body sound and in good condition enjoying the things that their natures require and free from things that are odious or hurtful to them i dont deny that all this is true well it seems worthwhile to consider whether the regular decent life of a virtuous man mightnt be as conducive to this as the mad sallies of intemperance and debauchery ill admit that without the aid of vice a nation may merely survive be kept alive but it cant possibly flourish to get money and goods into rapid circulation in a state there must be extravagant and irregular motions in the appetites and passions the more people a nation contains and the happier they are the more that nation can be said to flourish i think we are agreed on this we are so you concede that riches are not an ultimate end but should be considered only as a means to happiness i do it seems that means cant be useful unless we know what the end is and how to apply the means to it it seems so doesnt it follow that in order to make a nation flourish it isnt enough to make it wealthy without knowing what the true end and happiness of mankind is and how to apply wealth towards achieving that end to the extent that these points are known and practised i think the nation would be likely to flourish but for a people who dont know or practise them gaining riches seems to me on a par with letting a sick man have plenty of food and drink which it will harm him to consume this is just sophistry it is arguing without persuading look into how in general people live their lives examine the pursuits of men have a due respect for the peoples ways of interacting and getting on with one another and youll soon be convinced that a nation can be made flourishing and happy through richesjust through riches give them wealth and they will make themselves happy without that political invention that trick of governments and philosophers called virtue in the next few pages which are not philosophically very nourishing the main topics of discussion are these whether virtue is a trick of governments which segment of the population should be listened to with respect lysicles responds to euphranors suggestion of country gentlemen and farmers and the better sort of tradesmen with blundering rudeness if people in general are so open to prejudice mightnt there be some prejudice in the minute philosophers position bodily health is a real objective state which can be driven up or down by what is done to the body why not an analogous view of spiritual or mental health here is how this last theme develops cant we suppose that there is such a state as a healthy constitution of the soulthe state it is in when its notions are right its judgments true its will regular its passions and appetites kept moderate and directed to the right objects and the man whose mind is so constituted isnt he properly called virtuous and shouldnt every good man try to produce this healthy disposition in the minds of his countrymen if these things have any appearance of truth as they seem to me to have it isnt so obvious that virtue is a mere whim or fashion or trick as you choose to say it is you took me by surprise when you said this i must admit given the conversation we had about this yesterday evening if you call that back to your mind it might perhaps save both of us some trouble frankly euphranor i admit to having forgotten everything you said about virtue duty and all that the points you made were of an airy notional nature which made them apt to vanish without leaving any trace in a mind that is accustomed to receiving impression only from realities at this euphranor looked at crito and me and said smiling i have been getting out of line my role was to learn and his to instruct then we have several pages about happiness and especially pleasure human pleasures versus animal ones higher pleasures versus lower ones transient pleasures versus more lasting ones and so on euphranor alludes to the sincerity the intensity and the duration of pleasures at one point lysicles rhapsodizes about the pleasures of cardplaying people of fashion couldnt live without cards they provide the most delightful way of passing an evening for an assemblage of gentlemen and ladies who otherwise wouldnt know what to say or do with themselves and a pack of cards doesnt merely give them something to do when they are together it also draws them together squaredancing gives them a pleasure to look forward to during the dull hours of the day they reflect on it with delight and it is something to talk about when it is over so the chief amusement of these people of fashion is an activity that any manual labourer can engage in being as well qualified to get pleasure from cards as a peer is it looks as though life is a drag for these people of fashion and that their fortunes arent doing them much good i can well imagine that when people of a certain sort are brought together they would prefer doing anything to the boredom of their own conversation but it isnt easy to think that theres any great pleasure in this play here playing cards for money is a serious amusement that brings relief to a man of pleasure after the more lively and affecting enjoyments of sense it kills time better than anything and is a most admirable antidote to redirect or prevent thoughts that might otherwise prey on the mind i can easily see that no man on earth ought to value antidotes for irritable boredom more than a man of fashion and pleasure an ancient sage speaking of someone of that sort says he is made wretched by disappointments and appetites and if this was true of the greeks who lived in the sun and had so much spirit im inclined to think its even truer of our modern englishmen theres something in our climate and our makeup that makes it especially true of us that idleness its own punishment an uneducated fine gentleman pays for his momentary pleasures with long and cruel intervals of being bored and out of sorts to relieve these he is driven into sensual excesses which further depress his spirits his low condition while creating a greater need for pleasures lessens his ability to enjoy them an englishmans cast of mind makes him the most unsuccessful rake in the world a rakea term that well meet several times moreis a man whose way of life is stylish and fashionable but also promiscuous and dissolute he is in aristotles phrase at odds with himself he isnt brute enough to enjoy his appetites or man enough to govern them he knows and feels that what he pursues is not his true good and when he looks inwards all he finds is the misery that his habitual sluggishness and idleness wont allow him to remedy eventually having grown odious to himself and hating his own company he joins any idle group that he can not in the hope of pleasure but merely to relieve the pain of his own mind listless and uneasy in the present he has no delight in reflecting on what is past or in the prospect of anything to come when after a wretched lifetime of vanity and woe his animal nature is worn to the stumps this man of pleasure alternates between wanting death and dreading it he is sick of living without ever having tried or known the true life of man ironically its just as well that this sort of life which is of so little benefit to its owner brings so much benefit to the public then some discussion of courage and of why there arent more disillusioned minute philosophers who commit suicide critos answer because they arent sure they are right about god and the afterlife then socrates who was no country parson suspected that your men of pleasure were such ie were men of pleasure through ignorance ignorance of what of the art of computing calculating as it were mathematically he thought that rakes cant do their sums and that because of this lack in their intellects they make wrong judgments about pleasure where their happiness depends on their making right ones i dont understand you do you agree that the senses perceive only sensible things i do and the senses perceive only things that are present i accept that too so pleasures of the understanding and future pleasures arent to be judged by the senses they are not so people who judge pleasures by the senses may find themselves mistaken at the bottom line he quotes some lines from the latin satirical poet persius about someone ending up with his joints ruined by gout so that his limbs are like brittle beechtree branches lamenting the way he has spent his life and depressed at the thought of the kind of life that lies ahead of him then to get the computation right shouldnt you consider all the faculties and all the kinds of pleasure taking the future into account as well as the present and rating them all according to their true value the epicureans held that a pleasure that produces a greater pain or that hinders a greater pleasure should be regarded as a pain and that a pain that produces a greater pleasure or prevents a greater pain is to be accounted a pleasure thus if we are to make a true estimate of pleasurethat great spring of action from which the conduct of life gets its directionwe have to compute intellectual pleasures and future ones as well as sensible pleasures and present ones and in estimating each particular pleasure we have to take into account all the pains and evils all the disgust remorse and shame that come with it and we ought to take account of the kind as well as the quantity of each pleasure let a freethinker merely consider how little human pleasure consists in actual sensation and how much in prospect then let him then compare the prospect of a virtuous believer with that of an unbelieving rake euphranor briefly joins in and lysicles responds sharply that the freethinkers calculate that what you call a good christian must be unfit for the worlds affairs thus while you compute yourselves out of pleasure others compute you out of business then further conversation about the personal characters of minute philosophers and then about how they spread their wordthe role of writers in this the effects on the young of freethinking ideassavage anecdotes about this by crito then wouldnt there always be rakes and rogues even if we didnt make them believe me the world always was and always will be the same as long as men are men i deny that the world is always the same human nature to use alciphrons comparison is like land better or worse depending on how it is managed and what seeds or principles are sown in it i agree there might be bad men through the force of corrupt appetites and unruly passions even if nobody accepted your tenets but when to the force of appetite and passion men add the force of opinion and are wicked on principle there will be more men who are wicked and they will be more incurably and outrageously wicked the error of a lively rake lies in his passions and may be reformed but the dry rogue who sets himself up in judgments is incorrigible more discussion of the characters of minute philosophers their place in history and other related topics then we have a maxim namely that each should take care of oneie should take care of himself alas lysicles you wrong your own character you minute philosophers want to get the world and yourselves to accept you as cunning selfinterested men but can anything be more disinterested not self interested than to give up all concern with the theoretical pursuit of truth can anything be less cunning than to publish your discoveries to the world teach others to play the whole game and arm mankind against yourselves re play the whole game see lysicles speech well in our dialect on page to you folk who are fired with love of truth and love of liberty and grasping the whole extent of nature i suggest that to those loves you add love of your country forgive me for introducing such a lowdown thought i would urge you to be cautious in the same way that all other discoverers projectors and makers of experiments are they never risk everything on the first trial wouldnt it be prudent to try the success of your principles on a small model in some remote corner of the earth for instance set up a colony of atheists in monomotapa in southern africa and see how it prospers before you proceed any further at home halfadozen shiploads of minute philosophers could easily be spared for such a good plan in the meantime you gentlemen who have discovered that theres nothing to be hoped or feared in an afterlife that conscience is a nagging pest that the bands of government and the cement of human society are rotten things that can be dissolved and crumbled into nothing by the arguments of any minute philosopher be so good as to keep these sublime discoveries to yourselves and allow all the rest of us to continue in the beliefs and ways of thinking established by the laws of our country speaking seriously i do wish you would try your experiments among the hottentots or turks we think well of the hottentots believing them to be an unprejudiced people but im afraid their diet and customs wouldnt agree with our philosophers as for the turks they are bigots who have a notion of god and a respect for jesus christ i doubt if it would be safe to venture among them then make your experiment in some other christian country we think that all other christian nations are much under the power of prejudice even our neighbours the dutch are too much prejudiced in favour of their religion which their law has established for a prudent man to attempt innovations under their government on the whole it seems that no country can offer as much security and prospect of success for our schemes as england does not to mention the fact that we have already made good progress the right way to start this experiment was to wipe out the prejudices of individual persons we have carried on this work for many years working hard and skillfully at first secretly as our principles gained acceptance and as our numbers grew we gradually revealed ourselves and our opinions and i neednt tell you where we have now come to we have grubbed and weeded and cleared human nature so thoroughly that before long youll see natural and sound ideas sprout up by themselves without any labouring or teaching crito reports the view of a wise man whom he doesnt name that the worst and most unwholesome weed was this same minute philosophy from there he moves to recounting a fable about a contest in hell to select the devil who could do most harm to humanity the runnerup appeared as gunpowder producing great noise and destruction and fear the winner set up as a pharmacist thus he passed as a friend and a physician through the world disguised himself with sweets and perfumes and drugs made his way into pharmacies and ladies cabinets and under a pretence of helping digestion comforting the spirits and cheering the heart he produced direct contrary effects and quietly and invisibly pushed great numbers of mankind into a fatal decay ie a decay that was fatal in the sense of being fated inevitable unstoppable he populated hell and the grave so fast that he earned the post of ruler of hell which he still holds those who please may amuse themselves with fables and allegories this is plain english liberty is a good thing and we are the support of liberty it seems to me that liberty and virtue were made for each other if someone wants to enslave his country the best preparation for that is vice and nothing leads to vice so surely as irreligion does i simply cant understand and i have tried how this hostility to religion can be an effect of honest views regarding a just and legal liberty let us examine what good your principles have done who has been the better for the instructions of these minute philosophers let us compare what we are in respect of learning loyalty honesty wealth power and public spirit with what we have been freethinking as it is called has grown amazingly in recent years let us see what has grown up along with it or as a result of it i shant list all the resultant ills that would be a nasty task and on the other side there is the only blessing that the minute philosophy can claim namely luxurythe same blessing that opened up ancient rome to the worlds revenge the same luxury that makes a nation look full and fat when it actually has one foot in the grave you have this wrong our sect think and argue better than anyone about the public good of a state and we have invented here discovered many things that are conducive to the public good but cant yet conveniently be put into practice but the public has received one advantage from the spread of your principles namely the old roman practice of selfmurder this puts an end to all distress stopping miserable people from going on being a burden to the world and to themselves you chose to make some remarks about this custom a little while ago page and to laugh at the irresolution of our freethinkers who couldnt make up their minds to kill themselves but i can tell you as a matter of fact that they have often recommended it by their example as well as by arguments and that it is solely because of them that this practice useful and magnanimous as it is has been taken out of the hands of lunatics and restored to the status among men of sense that it had in ancient times in whatever light you may look at it this is in fact a solid benefit but the best effect of our principles is the light and truth that they have so visibly spread through the world the number of prejudices errors perplexities and contradictions that we have cleared out of the minds of our fellowsubjects the number of hard words and intricate absurd notions that possessed the minds of men before our philosophers appeared in the world now even women and children have right and sound notions of things what do you say to this crito i say regarding these great advantages of destroying men and notions that i doubt that the public gains as much by the destruction of notions as it loses by the destruction of men speaking for myself i had rather my wife and children all had beliefs with no real thoughts behind them and daily pronounced words without a meaning than that any one of them should cut her throat or leap out of a window the public doesnt care much about errors and nonsense as such it is less concerned with whether a notion is metaphysically true than with whether it will tend to produce good or evil truth itself is valued by the public because it does have an influence and is felt in the course of life but the minute philosophers are not the men to whom we owe most for discoveries of that kind im making this point on the basis that your notions are in fact true and in fact i dont think they are candidly i think they are not only harmful but also false the tendency of your opinions is so bad that no good man can endure them and your arguments for them are so weak that no wise man will accept them hasnt it been provedas clear as the midday sunthat since the spreading of our principles the more smoothly civilised sort of men have led much happier lives and have been swimming in pleasure but i dont want to repeat things that i have already proved so ill add just one point our principles bring advantages even to very small children and to women they deliver children from terrors by night and ladies from intensely bored hours by day crito fiercely attacks this saying that we should compute what a liberated lady will give up against what she will get through the minute philosophy and that at the bottom line you shall find that empty giddy gaudy fluttering thing not half so happy as a butterfly or a grasshopper on a summers day similarly for the liberated man ending with this when his sense and appetite fade and he seeks refuge from his conscience in the minute philosophy the real truth about him is that he affects much believes little knows nothing lysicles makes couple of short interventions in the second of them saying that none of this will make our principles less true crito snaps back their truth is not what we are talking about our present topic is the usefulness of your principles and to decide this all we need is to get an overview of them fairly stated and laid side by side there is no god or providence man is as the beasts that perish mans happiness like that of the beasts consists in obeying animal instincts appetites and passions all stings of conscience and sense of guilt are prejudices and errors of upbringing religion is a state trick vice is beneficial to the public the soul of man is corporeal and dissolves like a flame or vapour man is a machine driven according to the laws of motion so he does not act and cant be guilty of anything a wise man evaluates and chooses all his actions in this life on the basis of his own individual selfinterest it seems that these opinions and others like them are the tenets of a minute philosopherwho is himself according to his own principles an organ played on by perceptible objects a ball swatted about by appetites and passions he is so acuteminded that he can maintain all this by skillful reasoning so sharpsighted and penetrating and deep that he can discover that the only true wisdom is the most selfinterested secret cunning to round out this charactersketch this ingenious piece of clockwork having no source of action within itself and denying that it has or can have a single free thought or motion sets itself up as the protector of liberty and argues earnestly for freethinking the moment crito stopped speaking lysicles addressed himself to euphranor and me crito he said has taken a vast amount of trouble but has convinced me of only one solitary thing namely that i havent a hope of convincing him never in my whole life have i met with a man so deeply immersed in prejudice i leave it others to pull him out of the mire but i have better hopes of convincing you speaking for myself i said i can answer that my eyes and ears are always open to conviction i attend to everything that is said and my overall final judgment whether right or wrong will at least be quite impartial crito is bolder than i am undertaking in this way to scold and lecture a philosopher for my part i always find it easier to learn than to teach so ill ask for your help in ridding me of some worries about the practical effects of your opinionsa topic that i havent been able to get on top of though ever so willing when this is done perhaps we still wont tread in exactly the same steps perhaps we wont even walk on the same road but we shant keep coming into direct collision with one another he then presents a set of feeble examples in support of the general thesis that extremes lead to opposite extremes in the natural world and alsohe addsin the civil world where power produces licence and licence produces power bigots make atheists and atheists make bigots the threat is that if the success of the minute philosophy leads to lax government and great licentiousness there will be a reaction taking the country to the opposite extreme of something like what we might call fascism euphranor then launches into another worry that i have about the tendency of your opinions it is than an england cleansed of protestant christianity would create a spiritual vacuum not his phrase that would be filled by many subtle and effective covert missionaries for roman catholicism lysicles replies that the minute philosophers dont prefer any religion to any other and that if roman catholicism became the enforced orthodoxy of england they would all go along with it and what about their minute philosophy oh we should have more than ever of that for we should keep it all to ourselves crito remarks that the minute philosophers tend to make friends of the jesuits ignorantly unaware that the jesuits are subtle and sophisticated enough to make dupes of the minute philosophers then here crito paused and fixed his eyes on alciphron who during this whole conversation had sat thoughtful and attentive without saying a word sometimes seeming dissatisfied at what lysicles advanced at other times apparently serene and pleased as though approving some better thought of his own but the day was now far advanced and alciphron proposed to adjourn the argument till the following day then he said i shall put matters on a new foundation and in a light that is so full and clear that i am sure it will give entire satisfaction so we switched to talk about other things ate our picnic meal strolled on the beach and returned to critos home in the cool of the evening third dialogue wednesday the following day as we sat around the teatable in a summer parlour facing the garden alciphron turned down his cup sat back in his chair and said our sect is the only one on earth that has the special privilege of not being tied down by any principles while other philosophers declare themselves to be committed to certain doctrines ours assert a noble freedomdiffering from one another and often a single philosopher differing from himself among its other advantages this method of proceeding makes us of all men the hardest to refute you may show a particular tenet of ours to be wrong but this affects only those who maintain that thesis and only for as long as they maintain it some freethinkers dogmatize more than others do and on some points more than on others the doctrine of the usefulness of vice is something we are not all agreed on some of us are great admirers of virtue others have problems regarding vice and virtue speaking for myself i think that the doctrine maintained yesterday by lysicles is an ingenious bit of theory but for various reasons im inclined not to accept it and rather to join the virtue side in that debate that puts me in the company of a very small part of our sect but it may be the most thoughtful and praiseworthy part of it anyway after looking into it fairly and very carefully i think that we ought to prefer virtue to vice and that in doing so we would be doing good things for the public and for the reputation of our philosophers so you should know that a number of freethinkersmen who havent a grain of religion in their makeupare men of the most scrupulous honour which makes them men of virtue honour is a noble unpolluted source of virtue with absolutely no fear selfinterest or superstition mixed in with it it has all the advantages of religion with none of the drawbacks see qa note on page i so honour is the source of virtue ii a thing cant be the source of itself iii so the source has to be distinguished from whatever it is the source of iv so honour is one thing and virtue is another i agree virtuous actions are the effect and honour is their source or cause tell me now what the role of honour is in this is honour the will that produces the virtuous actions as their efficient cause or the final cause for which they are produced or right reason that governs and controls them or what the actions are about or do you use honour to stand for a faculty or appetite each of these is supposed to be in one way or another a source of human actions honour is none of them then please give me some notion or definition of it alciphron thought for a while and then answered that he defined honour to be a principle of virtuous actions euphranor replied as i understand it the word principle has several senses a sometimes by principles we mean the parts of which a whole is composed and into which it can be resolved or analysed its in this sense that the elements are called principles of compound bodies and words and syllables and letters are the principles of speech b sometimes by principle we mean a small individual seed the growth or gradual unfolding of which produces an organic body animal or vegetable in its proper size and shape c principles in other contexts are supposed to be certain fundamental theorems in arts and sciences in religion and politics now when you say honour is a principle of virtue in which if any of these sense are you using principle alciphron replied that he didnt mean it in any of those senses and that he defined honour to be a certain ardour or enthusiasm that glowed in the breast of a gallant man at that time enthusiasm tended to mean something close to fanaticism which sometimes replaces it in this version in the present context however it is safer to let the word stand euphranor remarked that it is always legitimate to put a definition in place of the term defined is this allowed he asked it is then cant we say that a man of honour is an ardent or heated man or an enthusiast alciphron replied that theres no point in such exactness that pedants may dispute and define but they can never reach the high sense of honour that distinguishes the fine gentleman this honour he said was a thing to be felt rather than explained crito seeing that alciphron couldnt bear being pressed any further on that matter and wanting to give some satisfaction to euphranor said that he wouldnt undertake to explain such a delicate matter but that he would repeat to them part of a conversation he once heard between a minute philosopher and a christian on the same subject the reported dialogue which is quite short represents the freethinkers honour as a disgracefully meagre affair pretty much limited to paying ones gambling debts and engaging in duels when challenged i dont want the opinion of someone of whom i know nothing tell me your own judgment about what honour is based on your own observations of men of honour well from everything that i have heard or seen i could never find that honourconsidered as an actionstimulus distinct from conscience religion reason and virtuewas anything but an empty name i really do think that those who base their conduct on the notion of honour have less virtue than other men and that what they seem to have as their substitute for virtue is derived either from the fashion of the day or from a conscience that has without their knowing it retained faint traces of the religious principles that were drummed into them in their childhood these two principles sources seem to account for everything that in those gentlemen men of fashion who are full of animal life are blustering braggarts when it comes to morality they would blush to let anyone think that they are afraid of conscience they go on about honour and want to be known as men of honour rather than as conscientious or honest men but so far as i can see this shiny glow of honour with nothing of conscience or religion beneath it to give it life and substance is no better than a meteor or sunset cloud i had a confused idea that honour had a lot to do with truth and that men of honour were the greatest enemies of all hypocrisy falsehood and disguise quite the contrary an unbeliever who thinks he has the most scrupulous honour without having the least grain of faith or religion will pretend to be a christiantake any test join in any act of worship kneel pray receive the sacramentall to serve his own selfinterest he wont feel that his honour is at stake when he solemnly declares and promises in the face of god and the world that he will love his wife and forsaking all others keep only to her while having not the faintest intention of keeping any part of his vowas he shows to everyone as soon as he gets her and her money in his power we had a notion here in the country that calling a man of honour a liar was the nastiest thing one could do and a very risky thing to do that is very true such a man doesnt mind lying but he hates to be called a liar alciphron having peacefully heard all this said the term freethinker covers men of very different sorts and sentiments so that freethinkers cant be said strictly to constitute a single sect with a particular system of positive and distinct opinions we do indeed all agree on certain points of unbelief certain negative principles and this agreement does in a way bring us together under the common idea of one sect but those negative principles as they take root in men who differ in age temperament and upbringing produce a wide variety of tendencies opinions and characters dont think that our greatest strength lies in the libertines and mere men of honour who constitute the majority of us no we have among us philosophers of a very different type enquiring thinkers who are governed not by such crude things as sense and custom but by highly principled virtue and elevated moralsand the less religious they are the more virtuous an unbeliever is the best qualified person for virtue of the high and disinterested not self interested kind because it is a lowdown and selfish thing to be virtuous through fear or hope as believers are the notion of a god who maintains a future state of rewards and punishments may indeed tempt or scare cowardly men into behaviour that is contrary to the natural tendency of their souls but it will never produce genuine virtue to get to the bottom of things to analyse virtue into its ultimate elements and settle a scheme of morals on its true basis you have to grasp that an idea of beauty is natural to the mind of man all men want beauty they are pleased and delighted with it for its own sake purely from an instinct of nature a man doesnt need arguments to make him identify and approve what is beautiful it strikes him at first sight and attracts him without a reason and just as this beauty is found in the physical features of material things so also theres a different though analogous kind of beautyan order a symmetry a handsomenessin the moral world and just as the eye perceives one sort of beauty so does the mind by a certain interior sense perceive the other sort and this sense talent or faculty is always sharpest and purest in the noblest minds just as we unhesitatingly pronounce a dress to be fine or a physical movement graceful we can with the same free untutored judgment tell straight off whether someones behaviour is beautiful to detect and enjoy this kind of beauty you need a delicate and fine taste but when someone has this natural taste thats all he needs he has no need for anything else as a principle to convince him of the value of beauty or as a motive to induce him to love virtue and every rational creature has something of this taste or sense though in varying degrees all rational beings are by nature social they are drawn towards one another by natural affections they unite into families clubs parties and commonwealths by mutual sympathy just as the various parts of our body guided by the sensitive soul contribute to our animal functions and are connected to make one whole organism so also the various parts of these rational systems guided by this moral or interior sense are held together have a fellow feeling do support and protect each other and jointly cooperate towards a single end thats the source of our joy in society our inclination towards doing good to our kind the approval and delight we have when we see other mens virtuous deeds or think back on our own by thinking about the fitness and order of the parts of a moral system operating regularly and held together by benevolent affections the mind of man achieves the highest notion of beauty excellence and perfection held by this sublime idea our philosophers infinitely despise and pity anyone who proposes or accepts any other motive to virtue selfinterest is a lowdown and ungenerous thing destroying the merit of virtue and falsehood of every kind is inconsistent with the genuine spirit of philosophy so your love for moral beauty and your passion for truth as such wont let you patiently endure those fraudulent impositions upon mankind god the immortality of the soul and rewards and punishments in an afterlife which purport to promote virtue but really destroy it destroy true virtue and at the same time contradict and belittle your noble theories thus tending to disturb and agitate mens minds and fill them with doomed hopes and empty terrors mens first thoughts and natural notions are the best in moral matters mankind doesnt need to be preached or reasoned or frightened into virtue which is such a natural and congenial thing for every human soul and if this is the caseas it certainly isit follows that all societys aims are secured without religion and that an unbeliever offers promise of being the most virtuous man in a true sublime and heroic sense while you say these things alciphron i feel a state of my soul like the trembling of one lute when the unison strings of another are plucked doubtless there is a beauty of the mind a charm in virtue a symmetry and proportion in the moral world the ancients knew this moral beauty by the name of honestum if we want to know what its force and influence are it may be worthwhile to inquire how it was understood and depicted by those who first considered it and gave it a name honestum according to aristotle is what is praiseworthy according to plato it is what is pleasant or profitablemeaning pleasant to a reasonable mind and profitable to its true interest euphranor gives the key words here in greek as well as in english or in one case honestum latin see qa note on page i when we think of an action as praiseworthy our thought goes beyond the bare action itself and takes in the opinion of others concerning it ii so this isnt a sufficient basis or source of virtue for a man to act on in a case where he thinks that his conduct cant be observed by any other thinking being iii when a man does something because he finds it pleasant or profitable we have to think that hell refrain from doing itor even do its oppositeif that has a prospect of greater pleasure or profit iv so it follows from this that the beauty of virtue in either aristotles or platos sense is not sufficient to get sensual and worldlyminded men to act virtuously v so it follows that hope of reward and fear of punishment are extremely useful in getting the balance of pleasant and profitable to swing down on the side of virtue thus bringing much benefit to human society alciphron appealed gentlemen you are witnesses of this unfair proceeding of euphranors who argues against us on the basis of platos and aristotles accounts of the beauty of virtue accounts that have nothing to do with our views the philosophers of our sect rise above all praise pleasure and selfinterest when they are captured and bowled over by the sublime idea of the beauty of virtue i apologise replied euphranor for supposing that todays minute philosophers think like those ancient sages but tell me alciphron since you dont adopt platos or aristotles account of it what do you understand the beauty of virtue to be define it explain it make me understand your meaning that so we can argue about the same thing if we dont do that well never reach a conclusion some things are better understood by definitions and descriptions but i have always observed that those who do least well concerning the beauty of virtue are those who try to define explain and dispute about it moral beauty is so unique and abstract so subtle fine and fleeting that it doesnt survive being handled and inspected like a jug or a boot so youll have to allow me my philosophic liberty to take my stand within the general and indefinite sense rather than entering into a precise and detailed account of this beauty possibly losing sight of it and also possibly giving you leverage for criticizing and inferring and raising doubts queries and difficulties about something thats as clear as the sun when nobody reasons upon it are you then saying alciphron that the notion of moral beauty is clearest when it is not thought about i say that its something to be felt rather than understood a certain je ne sais quoi french i dont know what we engage with it not through our conceptmanaging capacities but through a special sense which is properly called the moral sense because it is adapted to the perception of moral beauty as the eye is adapted to colours or the ear to sounds i have no doubt that men naturally have certain instinctive sensations or emotions that make them amiable and useful to each other examples are fellowfeeling with the distressed tenderness for our offspring affection towards our friends our neighbours and our country indignation against what is base cruel or unjust these emotions are implanted in the human soul along with various other factorsfears and appetites aversions and desireswith different minds differing in which of these are strongest and uppermost doesnt it then seem to be a very uncertain guide in morals for a man to follow his emotion or inward feeling if this were the general rule wouldnt it be sure to lead different men in different directions depending on which appetite or emotion was prevalent i dont deny that and doesnt it also follow that duty and virtue are more likely to be practised if men are led by reason and judgment balancing low and sensual pleasures against those of a higher kind present losses against future gains and the discomfort and disgust of every vice against the delightful practice of the opposite virtue and the pleasing thoughts and hopes that go with it or can there be a stronger motive to virtue than the belief that all things considered it is in every mans true selfinterest i tell you euphranor we despise the virtue of the man who calculates and deliberates and must have a reason for being virtuous the refined moralists among the freethinkers are enchanted and carried away by the abstract beauty of virtue they love virtue only for its own sake try an experiment on the first man you meet propose to him a villainous or unjust action get his initial sense of the matter and youll find that he detests it he may indeed later on be misled by arguments or overpowered by temptation but his original unpremeditated genuine thoughts are right and orthodox how can we account for this except through a moral sense which when left to itself has as quick and true a perception of the beauty and ugliness of human actions as the eye has of colours mightnt this be adequately explained in terms of conscience affection emotion education reason custom religion for all i know those sources of moral behaviour may be what you metaphorically call a moral sense what i call a moral sense is strictly literally and truly a sense and is different in kind from all the things you have just listed all men have it though some may fail to be aware of it in themselves euphranor smiled and said alciphron has made discoveries where i least expected him to in regard to everything else i would hope to learn from him but for knowledge of myself of the faculties and powers of my own mind i would have looked at home and i might have looked there for a good long time without finding this new talent even now after being tutored i still cant understand it i must say that alciphron speaks in a way that is too highflown and obscure for a topic that ought to be the most clearly understood of all i have often heard that your deepest experts and oldest and most experienced theoreticians are the most obscure lysicles is young and speaks plainly if he would favour us with his view of the moral sense that might perhaps be nearer to a level at which i can understand lysicles shook his head and in a solemn and earnest manner addressed us all gentlemen he said alciphron stands on his own legs i have no part in these refined notions he is now committed to defending if i must subdue my emotions take things in an abstract way think deeply love virtuein short if i must be an enthusiastthe deference i owe to the laws of my country make me choose to be an enthusiast in their way besides it is better to be an enthusiast for some end than to be an enthusiast for none this doctrine of virtue based not on religion but on a moral sense has all the solid inconveniences of the christian doctrine without its distracting hopes and prospects i wasnt counting on lysicles to back me up in this matter which after all doesnt need his help different topics require different treatments a subject may be too obscure for the dry and pedantic method of definition and distinctiondrawing or it may be too simple for it and we may know too little about a subject to be able to make it plainer by talking about it or we may know too much for further talk to be any help for my part i believe that if matters were fairly stated the rational satisfaction the peace of mind the inward comfort and conscientious joy that a good christian finds in good actions would not be found to fall short of all the ecstasy rapture and enthusiasm that are supposed to come from that high and undescribed source the moral sense seriously can any ecstasy be higher any rapture more affecting than what comes from the love of god and man from a conscience clear of sins from an inward discharge of duty with the secret delight trust and hope that go along with it o euphranor we who are devoted to the truth dont envy the groundless joys and mistaken hopes of a christianwe pity them and as for conscience and rational pleasure how can we allow a conscience without allowing a vindictive god and how can we suppose that the charm of virtue consists in any pleasure or benefit that comes from virtuous actions without thereby giving great advantages to the christian religion which seems to arouse its believers to virtue by the selfinterested pursuit of the highest pleasures as rewards alas if we granted this we would be opening the door to all those rusty old speeches about the necessity and usefulness of the great articles of faith the immortality of the soul an afterlife rewards and punishments and other such exploded notions according to our system and principles those factors may perhaps produce a low popular selfinterested kind of virtue but it is bound to destroy and extinguish virtue in the sublime and heroic sense of the word what youre saying now is perfectly intelligible i wish i understood your main principle as well so you are seriously at a loss can you really have no notion of beauty or have it but not know beauty to be lovable in itself and for itself tell me alciphron do all mankind have the same notion of a beautiful face the physical beauty of human beings seems to be rather mixed and various but isnt there a steady standard of beauty with regard to other things doesnt every human mind have the idea of order harmony and proportion o alciphron its a weakness of mine that i tend to get lost when the talk is abstract and general particular things are better suited to my faculties so let us stay with the objects of the senses and try to discover what it is that makes them beautiful and then using these sensible things as a ladder climb to the level of moral and intellectual beauty so please tell me what is it that we call beauty in the objects of sense alciphrons answer would as euphranor points out allow for beauty in tastes and smells so he tries again with an account that limits beauty to what can be seen alciphron after a short pause said that beauty consisted in a certain symmetry or proportion pleasing to the eye is this proportion the very same in everything or is it different in different kinds of things different doubtless the proportions of an ox would not be beautiful in a horse and we see also in inanimate things that the beauty of a table a chair a door consists in different proportions see qa note on page i this proportion implies the relation of one thing to another ii and these relations are based on size and shape iii for the proportions to be right those mutual relations of size and shape in the parts must be such as to make the whole thing complete and perfect in its kind iv a thing is said to be perfect in its kind when it fits the purpose for which it was made v so the parts have to be related and adjusted to one another in such a way that they can best work together to make the whole thing work properly vi but comparing parts with one another viewing them as belonging to one whole and relating this whole to its use or purpose seems to be the work of reason vii so strictly speaking proportions are not perceived by the sense of sight but only by reason through the means of sight viii so beauty in your sense of it is an object not of the eye but of the mind ix so the eye alone cant see that a chair is handsome or a door well proportioned that seems to follow but im not clear on this point lets see if theres any difficulty in it that chair you are sitting in do you think it could be regarded as wellproportioned or handsome if it didnt have that height depth breadth and wasnt adjusted so as to be comfortable to sit in it could not so the beauty or symmetry of a chair cant be taken in unless you know what the chair is for and relate its shape to that intended use and that cant be done by the eye aloneits work for the judgment so it is one thing to see an object and another to detect its beauty i admit this to be true he now repeats the point with the example of a door the standards for what makes a door beautifully proportioned reflect the fact that doors are for humans to go through alciphron agrees then tell me alciphron isnt there something truly decent and beautiful in dress no doubt there is if we want to get an idea of beauty in dress is anyone more likely to give it to us than painters and sculptors whose business it is to aim at graceful representations i believe not well then lets examine the draperies of the great masters in these arts for example how they were accustomed to clothe a matron or a man of rank he then launches into a fierce attack on current standards of dress the greeks and romans dressed themselves in a becoming manner whereas our gothic gentry have adopted standards and fashions that are absurd and ridiculous the reason for this and alciphron agrees is that instead of consulting use reason and convenience the moderns have gone in for fancy the unnatural parent of monsters he concludes that the beauty of dress depends on its serving certain ends and uses euphranor then launches into a fresh set of examples quoting virgil on a beautiful horse and then reporting ancient greek ideas about what makes a pillar beautiful there follows a long speech about architectural standards all of which is aimed at showing the subordinate relative nature of beauty architectural beauty he says reflects not only the use to which the building is to be put but also certain relationships to natural thingseg the proportions that make for beauty in a greek pillar have a definite relationship to the proportions of a wellshaped human body euphranor sums up the grand distinction between ancient greek and gothic architecture is that the gothic is fantastical and mostly not based on nature or reason necessity or use these being what account for all the beauty grace and ornament of the architecture of ancient greece what euphranor has said confirms the opinion i always entertained that the rules of architecture as of all other arts that flourished among the greeks were based on truth and nature and good sense he then expounds the point that the ancients didnt adhere slavishly to their rules of proportion etc being willing to depart from them whenever the particular distance position elevation or dimension of the building or its parts seemed to require it he contrasts careful and rational departure from rules with the capricious fantasticalness of contemporary architecture now i need something to be made clearernamely what the point is of this architectural detour werent we enquiring into beauty we were well what do you think alciphrondoesnt some real principle of beauty have to be at work when something pleases us here and now and also gave pleasure two thousand years ago and two thousand miles away yes it does and isnt that how things stand with respect to a sound piece of architecture nobody denies it architecture the noble offspring of judgment and fancy was gradually formed in the most civilised and informed countries of asia and in egypt greece and italy it was valued and admired by the most flourishing states and most renowned monarchs who at vast expense improved it and brought it to perfection it seems more than any other art to be specially involved with order proportion and symmetry so isnt it reasonable for us to think that architecture is the art that is most likely to help us get some rational notion of the je ne sais quoi in beauty and havent we learned from our detour that there is no beauty without proportion and that proportions are to be judged as sound and true only to the extent that they relate appropriately to some certain use or purposethis potential usefulness being what basically makes them please and charm i admit all this to be true in the next three speeches principle is used in a sense related to b in euphranors speech on pages think of it as meaning approximately generator or source of energy given this doctrine id like to know what beauty can be found in a moral system that has been formed tied together and governed by chance fate or any other blind unthinking principle without thought there can be no purpose or design without a purpose there cant be any usefulness and without usefulness there cant be any of the fitness of proportion from which beauty springs cant we suppose that the world is permeated throughout by a certain vital principle of beauty order and harmony without supposing a god who inspects punishes and rewards the moral actions of men without supposing the immortality of the soul or an afterlifein brief without accepting any part of what is commonly called faith worship and religion is this principle that you are supposing a thinking one or not if not then it is all of a piece with chance or fate which was argued against a moment ago if it does think then id like alciphron to tell me what is so beautiful in a moral system headed by a supreme thinking being that doesnt protect the innocent punish the wicked or reward the virtuous he goes on eloquently and at length about the beauty of a moral system in which everyone sees himself as the member of a great city whose author and founder is god and where all conduct aims at the noblest end namely the complete happiness or wellbeing of the whole then there will be great beauty in a system of spirits that are subordinate to gods will and under his direction with him governing them by laws and directing them by methods that are suitable to wise and good ends but how can there be beauty in an incoherent system that is governed by chance or in a blind system that is governed by fate or in any system where god doesnt preside where there is no thought there is no design and therefore no order and therefore no beauty contrast these two scenes a man is conscious that his will is inwardly conformed to gods will which produces order and harmony in the universe and conducts the whole by the most just methods to the best end that gives a beautiful idea but then a man is conscious that his virtue is overlooked neglected or held against him by men and not regarded or rewarded by god that this world has treated him badly and he has no hope or prospect of being better treated in another world wheres the beauty in that what pleasure can we get from thinking about it and how could any sane person think that spreading this idea of our moral situation is the way to spread or propagate virtue in the world an enthusiast may entertain himself with visions and fine talk about such a system but when it comes to be considered by careful thinkers with cool heads i dont think they will find any beauty or perfection in it and they wont think that such a moral system can possibly be the work of the same divine hand as the natural world throughout which there shines so much order harmony and proportion all this serves to confirm me in my opinion i said earlier page that regarding this highlevel beauty of morality a mans first thoughts are best and that well risk losing sight of it if we examine inspect and reason about it that there is such a thing cant be doubted when we realize that some of our philosophers today have a high sense of virtue without the least notion of religion that is a clear proof of the usefulness and effectiveness of our principles granting that some minute philosophers are virtuous we may venture to question the cause of their virtue you attribute it to an inexplicable enthusiastic notion of moral beauty i think it comes as euphranor said from personal temperament custom and religious education but anyway assign what beauty you please to virtue in an irreligious system it cant be less in a religious one unless you hold that virtues charms diminish as her dowry increases take all the motives of every sort that an unbeliever can possibly get from the beauty of virtue a believer can have them too as well as other motives that an unbeliever doesnt have so it is obvious that those of your sect who have moral virtue dont get it from their special freethinking doctrines which serve only to lessen the motives to virtue good freethinkers are less good and bad ones are more bad than they would have been if they were believers it seems to me that those heroic unbelieving lovers of abstract moral beauty are much to be pitied and much to be amazed by lysicles broke in impatiently gentlemen he said you shall have my whole thoughts about this topic plain and unvarnished everything that is said about a moral sense or about moral beauty in any meaning of that phrase whether said by alciphron or euphranor or anyone else i regard as basically mere windowdressing and pretence the beautiful and the decent are outward things and are relative and superficial they have no effect in the dark as they would if there were something solid about them they are merely showpieces to argue over and make speeches about as some of the selfannounced members our sect are accustomed to doing orthodox though they are about other things but if one of them got into power you wouldnt find him such a fool as euphranor imagines he would soon show that he had learned that the love of ones country is a prejudice that mankind are rogues and hypocrites and that it would be folly to sacrifice oneself for the sake of the likes of them that everything that matters relates to this life and that because to every man this life means his own life it clearly follows that charity begins at home claims are made of benevolence to mankind but what wise people put into practice is benevolence to themselves among our freethinker philosophers the livelier ones dont hesitate to accept these maxims openly and as for the more solemn ones we can guess what they must really think if they are true to their principles whatever effect pure theory may have on certain minority of very unusual minds or in some other parts of the world i really do think that in england now reason religion and law are all together little enough to get people to act in accordance with their consciences and that it would be downright stupid to think that without reason religion and law men would be in love with the golden mean ie in love with a temperate way of life one in which extremes are avoided indeed my countrymen may be even less inclined to be like that than others are because in the makeup of an english mind there is a certain hot eagerness that carries us to the sad extremein religion to fanaticism in freethinking to atheism in liberty to rebellion he goes on to say that the english like other northern people dont go in for beauty much and when they try they make a hash of it winding up but in no case is it to be hoped that the beautiful he says it in greek will be the leading idea of the great majority who have quick senses strong emotions and blunt intellects the fewer they are the more we should respect and admire such philosophers whose souls are transported by this sublime idea of moral beauty but then one might expect from such philosophers enough good sense and philanthropy to make them keep their tenets to themselves and consider the situation of their weak brethren who are more strongly affected by notions of another kind than that of the beauty of pure disinterested virtue consider the example of cratylus what follows is aimed at the third earl of shaftesbury who is berkeleys targetnot always fairly treatedthrough much of this work he was prejudiced against the christian religion was of an unsound constitution had a rank in society higher than most men can even aim at had a fortune equal to his rank had little capacity for sensual vices or temptation to dishonest ones he talked himself or thought he had into a stoic enthusiasm about the beauty of virtue then under the pretence of making men heroically virtuous he tried by undermining religion to destroy the means of making them reasonably and humanly so this is a clear example of the fact that neither birth nor books nor conversation can introduce a knowledge of the world into a conceited mind that will attend only to itself and look at mankind only in its own mirror cratylus was a lover of liberty and of his country he aimed to make men uncorrupt and virtuous on the purest and most disinterested principles its true that the main aim of all his writings as he himself tells us was to assert the reality of a beauty and charm in moral subjects as well as in natural ones to demonstrate a taste that he thinks more effective than principle to recommend morals on the same basis as manners and in this way to make progress in moral philosophy by giving it the same basis as the notions of what is agreeable and socially acceptable as for religious qualms the belief in an afterlife of rewards and punishments and such matters this great man doesnt hesitate to declare that the liberal polished and refined part of mankind must consider them only as childrens tales and pastimes of the vulgar so for the sake of the better sort of people he has in his great goodness and wisdom thought of something else namely a taste or flavour this he assures us is something that will influence people because according to him anyone who has any impression of gentility or polish is so acquainted with the fittingness and grace of things as to be easily bowled over by the thought of it his conduct seems to be about as wise as that of a monarch who announces that in his kingdom there is no jail and no executioner to enforce the laws but that it is beautiful to obey the laws and that in doing so men will taste the pure delight that results from order and decorum yet isnt it true that certain ancient philosophers ones of great noteheld the same opinion as cratylus declaring that noone counts as a good man if he practises virtue for any reason except that it is beautiful yes i think some of the ancients said things that gave rise to this opinion aristotle distinguishes between two ways in which someone can be a good manone he calls agathos or simply good the other he calls kalos kagathos these are hard to translate into english but his sense is plainly this agathos is the man to whom the good things of nature are good according to aristotle things that are vulgarly regarded as the greatest goodsriches honours power and bodily perfectionsare indeed good by nature and yet they happen to be hurtful and bad to some people because of their bad habits so that those natural goods are not good for a fool an unjust man or an intemperate man any more than a sick man is helped by getting nourishment that is proper for those who are in good health and kalos kagathos is the man in whom are to be found all things worthy and decent and praiseworthy purely as such and for their own sake and who practises virtue solely because of his love of virtues innate beauty aristotle also observes that there is a certain political way of thinking and behaving that the spartans and others had who thought that virtue was to be valued and practised because of the natural advantages that come with it this makes them good men he says but they dont have the supreme consummate virtue this makes it clear that according to aristotle someone can be a good man without believing that virtue its own reward or being moved to virtue only by the sense of moral beauty its also clear that he distinguishes the political virtue of nations which the public is everywhere concerned to maintain from this highminded and theoretical kind of virtue notice also that his highlevel kind of virtue was consistent with supposing a providence that inspects and rewards the virtues of the best men he says if the gods care at all about human affairs as they seem to it seems reasonable to suppose that they are most delighted with the part of our nature that is most excellent and most like their own natures namely our minds and that they will reward those who chiefly love and cultivate what is most dear to them he remarks that the majority of mankind are naturally inclined to be awed not by shame but by fear and to abstain from vicious conduct not because of its ugliness but only because of the punishment it brings all this shows us very clearly what aristotle would have thought of those who would set to work to lessen or destroy mankinds hopes and fears in order to make them virtuous purely because of the beauty of virtue well whatever aristotle and his followers thought isnt it certain that the stoics maintained this doctrine in its highest sense asserting that the beauty of virtue is allsufficient that virtue is her own reward that only virtue could make a man happy despite all the things that are vulgarly regarded as the greatest woes and miseries of human life and they held all this while also believing that the soul of man is some kind of material thing which at death is dissipated like a flame or vapour yes the stoics do sometimes talk as if they believed the soul to be mortal in dealing with this topic in one of his letters seneca speaks much like a minute philosopher but in several other places he declares himself to have the outright opposite opinion asserting that mens souls after death rise into the heavens and look down on earth crito then talks learnedly about marcus aurelius he sometimes speaks of the soul as perishing or scattering but for him the soul was a rather low part of a man to be distinguished from his mind or governing principle at a mans death according to him the mind remains intact it is a particle of god which goes back whole to the stars and the divinity concluding thus along with all his magnificent lessons and splendid views about the force and beauty of virtue marcus is positive about the existence of god in the strict sense of a providence inspecting and taking care of human affairs despite their high style therefore the stoics cant be said to have reduced every motive for living virtuously to just onethe beauty of virtuein such a way as to attempt to destroy peoples belief in the immortality of the soul and a providence that hands out rewards and punishments and anyway supposing that the disinterested stoics did make virtue its own and its only reward taking this in the most rigid and absolute sense what does that imply for those of us who are not stoics if we adopt all the principles of that sect accepting their notions of good and evil their famous indifference to sufferingin short setting ourselves up as complete stoicsthat may enable us to maintain this doctrine of virtue for its own sake with a better grace at least it will fit consistently into our whole stoic scheme of things but if you borrow this splendid patch from the stoics hoping to make a big impression by inserting it into a modern composition spiced with the wit and notions of the present day youll make an impression all right but on the mind of a wise man it may not be the impression you intended though i must admit that although embroidering a stoic patch with jokes ought to make you look ridiculous you might get away with it because the present age is very indulgent to everything that aims at mockery of religion not everyone likes humorous writings and not everyone can produce them the truth is that the variety in readers tastes requires a variety of kinds of writers our sect has provided for this with great judgment to spread our word to people of the more serious sort we have men who can reason and argue deeply and well for the runofthemill general reading public we have writers who produce lengthy rhetorically persuasive pieces and for men of rank and social polish we have the finest and wittiest mockers in the world whose ridicule is the sure test of truth this refers to shaftesbury who in his book characteristics of men manners opinions times wrote about wit and humour in philosophy see qa note on page i no doubt that ingenious mockers are knowledgeable men ii they know about the copernican theory of the planets the circulation of the blood and so on iii they believe that there is land in the far south of the southern hemisphere that there are mountains on the moon that the earth moves iv if five or six centuries ago a man had maintained these notions among the clever wits at an english court they would have been received with ridicule v whereas now it would be ridiculous to ridicule them vi yet truth was the same then as it is now vii so it seems that ridicule is not such a secure test of truth as you gentlemen imagine one thing we do know our mockery and sarcasm infuriate the black tribe of priests and theologians and that is our comfort something else that it may be worthwhile for you to know men who are doubled over with laughter may be applauding a piece of mockery that theyll find contemptible when they recover from their laughing fit well anyway this much is certain our clever men make converts by deriding the principles of religion and i can assure you that mockery is the most successful and pleasing method of convincing someone these authors laugh men out of their religion as the latin poet horace laughed them out of their vices but a bigot cant enjoy their witindeed he cant detect it crito speaks slightingly of wit without wisdom then moves back to the centre of their topic of conversation citing examples from ancient rome of good able people whose attitude to virtue involved their belief in an afterlife in which virtue is rewarded alciphron replies that these men were very well for their times but that they didnt achieve the highlevel kind of virtue that our modern freethinkers have so it should seem that virtue flourishes more than ever among us it should and this abundant virtue is to be explained by the way in which your profound writers went about recommending it this i grant but you have admitted that enthusiastic lovers of virtue are not a majority in your sect but only a small select minority alciphron didnt answer this but crito stepped in to make a true estimate of the worth and growth of modern virtue he said to euphranor what you should go by is not the number of virtuous men but rather the quality of their virtue and the virtue of these refined freethinking theorists is so pure and genuine that a very little of it goes a long way in fact it is invaluable theres no comparison between it and the reasonable selfinterested virtue of the english of earlier times or of the spartans turns of phrase which could mean that this kind of morality is very powerful and so wonderful as to be above all price and incomparably better than the morality of the spartans etc but which could instead mean that the less we see of it the better and it is worthless and is it incomparably worse that the morality of the spartans etc see qa note on page i there are diseases of the soul as well as of the body ii the diseases of the soul are vicious habits iii and just as bodily ailments are cured by medicines mental ailments are cured by philosophy iv so it seems that philosophy is a medicine for the soul of man v the way we judge concerning medicines deciding which ones to prefer is from the effects they bring about vi suppose that in the middle of an epidemic a new physician condemned the known established practice and recommended another method of cure and suppose that some people had plausible things to say in support of this proposal wouldnt you be inclined to let your attitude to it be governed by whatever difference it made to the mortality figures all you are doing is creating confusion and taking us away from our topic this reminds me of my friend lamprocles who needed only one argument against unbelievers i have noticed he told me that as unbelief grew so did corruption of every kind as well as new vices this simple observation of a matter of fact was enough to make him fill the minds of his children from an early age with the principles of religion despite the protests of many clever men the new theories that our clever moderns have tried to substitute for religion have run their full course in our times and have produced their effect on the minds and conduct of men that men are men is a sure maxim but its equally sure that englishmen are not the same men that they wereand you dont need me to tell you whether they are better or worse more or less virtuous than they used to be everyone can see and judge that for himself whatever the consequences may be i can never bring myself to agree with those who measure truth by convenience the only god i worship is truth wherever it leads i shall follow so you have a passion for truth undoubtedly for all truths for all to know them or to publish them both what would you busily correct the procedures of an enemy who was going about his attack in the wrong way would you help an enraged man to take out his sword in such cases common sense tells one how to behave so common sense should be consulted about whether a truth is salutary or hurtful fit to be declared or fit to be concealed how you would have me conceal and stifle the truth and keep it to myself is that what you aim at i only draw an obvious conclusion from things you say as for myself i dont believe that your opinions are true you do but if you are going to be consistent with yourself you shouldnt think it necessary or wise to publish hurtful truths just because they are true what service can it do mankind to lessen the motives to virtue and what harm can it do to increase them none in the world but i have to say that i cant square the accepted notions of god and providence with my understanding and i am just naturally revolted by the lowness of pretending not to notice a falsehood shall we therefore appeal to truth and examine the reasons that hold you back from believing in god and providence with all my heart but that is enough for just now lets make this the subject of our next conversation fourth dialogue thursday as i looked out of my window early the next morning i saw alciphron walking in the garden with all the signs of a man in deep thought i went down to him alciphron i said this early and profound meditation frightens me why because i would be sorry to be convinced that there is no god the thought of anarchy in nature is more shocking to me than the thought of anarchy in civil life because natural concerns are more important than civil ones and are the basis of all the others i grant replied alciphron that some inconvenience might follow from disproving the existence of god but as for what you say of fright and shocking all that is nothing but prejudice mere prejudice men form an idea or fanciful picture in their own minds and then bow down and worship it notions govern mankind but no other notion has taken such deep root or spread so widely as the notion of gods governing the world so its an heroic achievement by philosophy to unthrone this imaginary monarch and banish all those fears and spectres that only the light of reason can dispel it will be my role i said to stand by as i have done up to now taking notes of everything that happens during this memorable eventthe attempt of a less than sixfeettall minute philosopher to dethrone the monarch of the universe they kick this around a little and then are joined by euphranor and by crito who remarks that with alciphron having made such an early start we can expect to see atheism placed in the best light and supported by the strongest arguments then they get straight on with it not even finding somewhere to sit down the existence of a god is a subject on which countless commonplaces have been uttered theres no need for me to repeat them so allow me lay down certain rules and limitations so as to shorten this conversation the aim of debating is to persuade so anything that wont persuade should be left out of our debate here are three limitations on arguments against me i cant be persuaded by metaphysical arguments such as those from the idea of an allperfect being or from the absurdity of an infinite chain of causes i have always found arguments of this sort dry and thin and because they arent suited to my way of thinking they may puzzle me but theyll never convince me i cant be persuaded by the authority either of past ages or our present time the authority of mankind in general or of particular wise men none of that counts for much with a man who argues soundly and thinks freely arguments based on the utility or convenience of the belief in god are beside the point they may indeed prove the usefulness of the belief but not the existence of the thing the rigorous eyes of a philosopher can see that truth and convenience are very different things whatever legislators or statesmen may think so that i wont seem biased i also propose two limitations on arguments that i can use on my side i wont argue from anything that may seem irregular or unaccountable in the works of nature to the conclusion that nature is not caused by infinite power and wisdom i already know how you would answer such an argument if i did use it namely by saying that noone can judge the symmetry and use of the parts of an infinite machinewhose appropriateness and usefulness depends on how they relate to each other and to the wholewithout having a grasp of the entire machine the whole universe i undertake not to argue from premises about the harms that good men suffer and the prosperity that wicked men often enjoy in this life if i did argue in that way i know how you would reply instead of admitting this as a good argument against the existence of god you would make it an argument for an afterlife in which rewards and punishments will be distributed in ways that vindicate the divine attributes and set everything right at the end by not using those arguments i deprive you of an opportunity to give those answers but there is no unfairness in that even if the answers are good ones they arent arguments for the existence of god all they do is to solve certain difficulties that might be brought against the existence of god on the assumption that it had already been proved by proper argumentsi thought i should specify all this so as to save us all time and trouble what we should be aiming at here is the discovery and defence of truth and truth may be justified not only by persuading its adversaries but alsoif they cant be persuadedby showing them to be unreasonable so an argument that sheds light will have its effect even against an opponent who shuts his eyes because it will show him to be obstinate and prejudiced anyway minute philosophers are less attentive than anyone to this distinction between arguments that puzzle and arguments that convince so the distinction neednt be respected by others in their favour but euphranor may be willing to encounter you on your own terms in which case i have nothing more to say alciphron acts like a skillful general who works to get the advantage of the ground and entice the enemy to come out of their trenches we who believe in a god are entrenched in tradition custom authority and law but alciphron does not try to dislodge us instead he proposes that we should voluntarily abandon these entrenchments and attack him when we could easily and securely act on the defensive leaving him the trouble to dispossess us of what we need not resign the reasons that you have mustered up in your earlymorning meditation he continued addressing alciphron if they dont weaken our belief in a god must help to strengthen it for the utmost is to be expected from such a great a master in his profession when he really gets to work on something i regard the confused notion of a deity or supreme invisible power to be the most unconquerable of all prejudices when half a dozen able men get together over a glass of wine in a well lighted room we easily banish all the spectres of imagination or upbringing and are very clear about what we think and why but as i was taking a solitary walk before it was broad daylight this morning the issue seemed not quite so clear and i couldnt bring to mind the force of the arguments that have usually appeared so conclusive at other times i experienced a strange kind of awe and seemed haunted by a sort of panic which i cant account for except by supposing it to be the effect of prejudice you see i like the rest of the world was once a long time ago drilled and tutored into the belief in a god there is no surer mark of prejudice than believing something without any reason so what need is there for me to set myself the difficult task of proving a negative when it is sufficient for me to point out that there is no proof of the affirmative and that accepting it without proof is unreasonable so go ahead and prove your opinion if you cant you may indeed continue to have it but what you have will be merely a prejudice o alciphron if we are to content you we must prove it seems and we must do it on your terms well for a start let us see what sort of proof you expect the sort of proof i demand im not saying i expect it is the sort that every intelligent man requires for any matter of fact or for the existence of any particular thing other than himself why do i believe there is a king of great britain because i have seen him or a king of spain because i have seen people who saw him but as for this king of kingsi havent seen him myself nor have i seen anyone else who has seen him if there is such a thing as god surely its very strange that he has left himself without a witness that men should still be arguing about his existence and that there should be not a single evident sensible plain proof of his existence without having to bring in philosophy or metaphysics a matter of fact has to be proved not by notions but by facts you see what i am up to these are the principles on the basis of which i defy superstition so you believe as far as you can see that is my rule of faith what you wont believe in the existence of things that you hear unless you also see them no thats wrong when i insisted on seeing i meant to be talking about perceiving in general outward objects make very different impressions on the animal spirits impressions that are lumped together under the common label sense and whatever we can perceive by any sense we may be sure of a widely accepted theory going back at least as far as descartes held that the workings of animal bodies involve animal spirits envisaged as extremely fine and fluid matter that can get through holes that are too small to let even air pass through so you believe that there are such things as animal spirits doubtless what sense do you perceive them by i dont perceive them immediately by any of my senses but i am convinced of their existence because i can infer it from their effects and operations they are the messengers which running to and fro in the nerves enable outward objects to affect the soul so you admit the existence of a soul provided i dont admit an immaterial substance i see no drawback to allowing that there may be such a thing as a soul it may be no more than a thin fine texture of superfine parts or spirits residing in the brain im not asking about its nature i only ask whether you accept that there is a source of thought and action and whether it is perceivable by sense i grant that there is such a source and that it isnt itself an object of sense but we infer it from appearances that are perceived by sense see qa note on page i if i understand you rightly from animal functions and motions you infer the existence of animal spirits and from reasonable acts you infer the existence of a reasonable soul ii so it seems that the existence of things that cant be perceived through the senses can be inferred from sensible effects and signs iii the soul is what makes the principal distinction between a real person and a shadow between a living man and a carcass iv so i cant know that you for instance are a distinct thinking individual a living real man except by inferring from certain signs that you have a soul v all acts that are immediately and properly perceived by sense come down to motion vi so from motions you infer a mover or cause and from reasonable motions or such as appear calculated for a reasonable end you infer a rational cause soul or spirit vii now the soul of man drives only a small body an insignificant particle by comparison with the great masses of nature the elements the heavenly bodies the system of the world and the wisdom that appears in the motions that are the effect of human reason is incomparably less than the wisdom that reveals itself in the structure and use of organized natural bodies animal or plant a man cant make with his hand a machine as admirable as the hand itself and none of the motions by which we trace out human reason come anywhere near to the skill and ingenuity of the wonderful motions of the heart brain and other vital parts that dont depend on the will of man viii so it follows that from natural motions that are independent of mans will we can infer both power and wisdom incomparably greater than that of the human soul ix furthermore in natural productions and effects there is a visible unity of plan and design the rules of nature are fixed and immovable the same laws of motion apply throughout the same in china and here the same two thousand years ago and today x and from the mutual respects influences subordinations and uses involved in the way animals relate to plants animals and plants relate to the elements and elements relate to heavenly bodies we can infer that they are all parts of one whole all working towards the same end and fulfilling the same design supposing all this to be true wont it then follow that this vastly great perhaps infinitepower and wisdom must be supposed to be in one single agent spirit or mind and that our certainty of the existence of this infinitely wise and powerful spirit is at least as clear full and immediate as our certainty of the existence of any one human soul apart from our own let me think i suspect we proceed too hastily remember that in the original qa version alciphron gave a consecutive series of nine positive answersit is it may i grant it is and so on what do you claim that you can have the same assurance of the existence of a god that you can have of my existence when you actually see me stand in front of you and talk to you the very same assurance if not a greater how do you support that the phrase the person alciphron means an individual thinking thing not the hair skin or visible surface or any part of the outward form colour or shape of alciphron this i grant in granting that you grant that strictly speaking i dont see alciphron ie that individual thinking thing but only visible signs and tokens that suggest and imply the existence of that invisible source of thought or soul in exactly the same way it seems to me that though i cant with my physical eyes see the invisible god i do in the strictest sense see and perceive by all my senses the signs and tokens effects and operations that suggest and indicate and demonstrate the existence of an invisible god doing this as certainly and making it at least as evident as any signs suggesting to me the existence of your soul spirit or thinking principle i am convinced that your soul exists by a few signs or effects and the movements of one small organic body whereas i am always and everywhere perceiving sensible signs that point to the existence of god so the thesis that you doubted or denied at the outset now seems obviously to follow from the premises throughout this whole inquiry havent we carefully thought about every step we took not moving to accept any proposition that wasnt clearly evident you and i examined and assented to each foregoing proposition one by one so what should we do with the conclusion speaking for myself if you dont come to my rescue i shall absolutely have to accept the conclusion as true so if i live and die as a believer in god youll have to take the blame i have to admit that i dont readily find an answer there seems to be some foundation for what you say but if this matter is as clear as you claim it is i cannot conceive how so many able men of our sect of freethinkers should be so much in the dark that they dont know or believe one syllable of it alciphron its not our present business to explain the oversights or vindicate the honour of those great men the freethinkers when their very existence is in danger of being called in question how so remember your concessions and then show me if the arguments for a god are not conclusive what better argument you have to prove the existence of the thinking thing which in strictness constitutes the freethinker alciphron stopped in his tracks and stood in a posture of meditation while the rest of us continued our walk after a little while he rejoined us with a smiling face like someone who had made some discovery i have found he said something that may clear up the point in dispute and completely answer euphranors challenge i mean an argument that will prove the existence of a freethinker but cant be adapted to prove the existence of a god this idea of yours that we perceive the existence of god as certainly and immediately as we do that of a human person was more than i could swallow though i have to admit that it puzzled me until i had thought it through at first i thought that a particular structure shape or motion might be the most certain proof of a thinking reasonable soul but a little attention satisfied me that these things have no necessary connection with reason knowledge and wisdom perhaps they are certain proofs of a living soul but they cant be certain proofs of a thinking and reasonable one on second thoughts and after a minute examination of this point i have found that nothing so much convinces me of the existence of another person as his speaking to me its hearing you talk that is the best strict and philosophical argument i have for your existence and this is a restricted argument that cant be adapted to your purpose for you wont claim that god speaks to man in the same clear and audible way as one man speaks to anotherwill you what is the impression of sound so much more evident than that of other senses and if it is is the voice of man louder than that of thunder you are missing the point what im talking about is not the sheer sound of speech but language we have perceptible signs that dont resembleand arent necessarily connected withthe things they signify the way we use them is arbitrary in the sense of being chosen by us rather than laid down in the nature of things and what we use them for is to suggest and exhibit to the minds of others an endless variety of things that differ in nature time and place thereby giving one another information entertainment and direction for how to act with regard to near and present things and also distant and future things whether these signs are pronounced and heard or written and seen they have the same use and are equally proofs of an intelligent thinking designing cause but what if it should appear that god really speaks to man would this content you i dont accept stories about inward speech holy instincts or indications of light or spirit men of good sense regard all that as nothing to achieve something on this topic youll need to make it plain to me that god speaks to men by outward perceptible signs of the same kind and in the same way as i have defined well if i show it to be plainly the case that god speaks to men through arbitrary outward perceptible signs that dont resembleand arent necessarily connected withthe things they stand for and suggest and that by countless combinations of these signs an endless variety of things is revealed and made known to us and that through this we are instructed or informed about the different natures of things are taught and warned about what to avoid and what to pursue and are told how to regulate our movements and how to act with respect to things that are far off in space or in the futurewill this satisfy you its just the thing im challenging you to prove for it incorporates the force and use and nature of language see qa note on page i look alciphron you can see a castle on that hill over there ii it is a long way away iii a things distance from oneself is a line turned endwise to the eye iv and a line in that situation cant project more than one single point on the bottom of the eye v so the appearance of a long distance has the same size as the appearance of a short one or rather neither of them has any size at all because always what you have at the eye is a single point vi it follows from this that distance is not immediately perceived by the eye vii so it must be perceived by the mediation of some other thing viii to discover what this mediatorthis intermediate itemis let us examine how the appearance of an object changes as it is placed at different distances from the eye i find by experience that as an object is moved further and further away from me its visible appearance becomes lesser and fainter and this change of appearance seems to be what we go by in taking in differences of distance ix but littleness or faintness dont seem in themselves to be necessarily connected with greater distance x so its only because of our experience that littleness and faintness suggest or are signs of distance x that is to say we dont perceive distance immediately we perceive it through the mediation of a sign that doesnt resemble it and isnt necessarily connected with it but only suggests it on the basis of repeated experience as words suggest things wait a bit euphranor ive just remembered that writers on optics tell us of an angle that the two optic axes make where they meet at the object being looked at the more obtuse this angle is the nearer it shows the object to be and the more acute the angle the further away the object is and this holds not as something arbitrary that we learn by experience but as a necessary connection that can be demonstrated so the mind discovers how far away things are by geometry it does wouldnt it follow then that the only people who could see are those who have learned geometry and know something of lines and angles theres a sort of natural geometry that is acquired without learning but alciphron in order to construct a proof of any kind or deduce a conclusion from premises dont i have to perceive how the terms are connected with one another in the premises and how the premises are connected with the conclusion more generally if i am to know one thing x by means of another thing y dont i first have to know y when i perceive your meaning by your words dont i have first to perceive the words themselves and in any inference dont i have to know the premises before i infer the conclusion all this is true thus whoever infers a nearer distance from a wider angle or a further distance from an acuter angle must first perceive the angles themselves someone who doesnt perceive those angles cant infer anything from them can he it is as you say now ask the first man you meet whether he perceives or knows anything of those optic angles or whether he ever thinks about them or infers anything from them whether by natural or by artificial geometry how would you expect him to answer candidly i think he would answer that he knew nothing of those matters so it cant be true that men judge distance by angles and that removes all the force from your argument to prove that distance is perceived by means of something that has a necessary connection with it i agree with you it seems to me that a man can know whether or not he perceives a thing and if he does perceive it he can know whether he does this immediately or mediately and if he perceives it mediately he can know whether he is doing this by means of something like or unlike the thing necessarily or arbitrarily connected with it it seems so and isnt it certain that if distance is not perceived immediately just by itself or by means of any image that resembles it or by means of any lines and angles that have a necessary connection with it it is perceived only by means of experience it is from the things i have said and you have agreed to doesnt it seem to follow that before a man had any experience he wouldnt imagine that the things he saw were at any distance from him what show me the smallness or faintness of appearance or any other idea or sensation that doesnt resemble distance and isnt necessarily connected with it cant suggest differences of distancecant suggest anything about distanceto a mind that hasnt experienced a connection between those things and distance any more than words can suggest notions to a man before he has learned the language i agree that thats true then doesnt it follow that a man who was born blind and was then enabled to see would when he first gained his sight take the things he saw to be not at any distance from him but rather in his eye or in his mind i have to admit that this seems right and yet i find it hard to believe that if i were in such a state i would think that the objects i now see at such a great a distance were at no distance at all so you do now think that the objects of sight are at a distance from you certainly i do can anyone question that that castle over there is at a great distance tell me alciphron can you pick out the doors windows and battlements of that same castle i cant at this distance it seems only a small round tower but i have visited the castle and i know that its not a small round tower but a large square building with battlements and turrets that you evidently dont see what do you infer from that i infer that the object that you strictly and properly perceive by sight is not the very same thing as the one that is several miles distant why so because a little round object is one thing and a great square object is another isnt that right i cant deny it tell me isnt the proper object of sightthe thing that we actually strictly immediately seethe visible appearance it is what do you now think about the visible appearance of the moon up there isnt it a round shining flat thing no bigger than a sixpence what if it is well tell me what you think about the moon itself dont you think of it as a vast opaque globe with many hills and valleys i do then how can you think that the proper object of your sight exists at a distance i admit that i dont know to convince you even more consider that crimson cloud in the east do you think that if you were in it you would perceive anything like what you now see by no means all i would see is a dark mist isnt it clear then that the castle the moon and the cloud that you see here are not the real castle moon and cloud that you suppose exist at a distance what am i to think then do we see anything at all or is the visual side of our lives nothing but fancy and illusion here is the bottom line as i understand it the proper objects of sight are light and colours with their many hues and degrees of saturation and of brightness these can be varied and put together in countless different ways forming a language that is wonderfully adapted to indicate and exhibit to us the distances shapes locations sizes and various qualities of tangible objects ones we can perceive through our sense of touch the objects of sight dont resemble the tangible things nor are they necessarily connected with them the association of sight with touch is due to gods choosing it its like the association between words and the things signified by them what dont we strictly speaking perceive by sight such things as trees houses men rivers and so on we do indeed perceive or apprehend those things by the faculty of sight but it doesnt follow from this they are the proper and immediate objects of sight any more than that all the things that are signified by the help of spoken words or sounds are the proper and immediate objects of hearing so you want us to think that light shades and colours variously combined correspond to the many articulations of sound in language and that by means of them all sorts of objects are suggested to the mind through the eye in the same way that they are suggested by words or sounds through the earie not through logical inference by the faculty of judgment and not through similarities that are picked up by the imagination but purely and solely from experience custom and habit i dont want you to think anything more than the nature of things obliges you to think i dont want you to submit in the least to my judgment but only to the force of truth and i doubt if even the freest thinkers will claim to be exempt from that constraint you have led me step by step to a place where i am lost but ill try to get out again if not by the way i came then by some other that i find for myself short pause then tell me euphranor wouldnt it follow from these principles that a man who had been born blind and was then enabled to see would at first sight not only not perceive how far away men and trees etc were from him but also not perceive that they were men and trees surely this is absurd i agree that the principles we have both accepted do imply that such a man would never think of men trees or any other objects that he had been accustomed to perceive only by touch at the stage of his development that we are talking about his mind would be filled with new sensations of light and colours whose various combinations he wouldnt yet understand or know the meaning of any more than a chinese person on first hearing the words man and tree would think of men and trees in each case there has to be time and experience in which repeated events would enable him to acquire a habit of knowing how the signs are connected with the things that are signified ie to enable him to understand the language whether the language of the eyes or the language of the ears i see nothing absurd in all this the phrase the language of the eyes refers not to human language as written down but to gods language in which the visual appearances of things inform us about their distances and their tactual qualities in strict philosophical truth therefore i see that rock only in the sense in which i hear that rock when i hear the word rock being uttered in the very same sense then why is it that everyone will say that he sees a rock or a house when those things are before his eyes whereas nobody will say that he hears a rock or a house when he hears and understands the words rock or house and a second point if vision is only a language speaking to the eyes when did men learn this language its a pretty difficult task to learn the meanings of all the signs that make up a language but noone will say that he has devoted time and trouble to learning this language of vision thats not surprising if we have been all practising this language ever since our first entrance into the world if god constantly speaks to the eyes of all mankind even in their earliest infancy whenever their eyes are open in the light it doesnt seem to me at all strange that men arent aware they ever learned a language that they began on so early and practised so constantly as this language of vision remember also that it is the same language throughout the whole world and not differing in different places as other languages do so we can understand how men might mistake the connection between the proper objects of sight and the things they signify for some kind of similarity or necessary relation and even how they might take them to be the same things euphranor then points out that our conscious minds tend overlook things that we are in fact steering by when they are extremely familiar for example youve been reading this page without consciously attending to the individual letters of which the words are made up alciphron grumbles that euphranors points are too dry and tedious for a gentlemans attention crito snaps back at him alciphron replies trying to lower the temperature and then to cut short this squabbling resumes the discussion i put it fairly to your own conscience do you really think that god himself speaks every day and in every place to the eyes of all men that is really and truly what i think and you should think it too if you are consistent with yourself and stand by your own definition of language you cant deny that the great mover and author of nature constantly explains himself to the eyes of men by means of perceptible arbitrary signs that have no resemblance or necessary connection with the things signified so that by compounding and arranging them to suggest and exhibit an endless variety of objects of different kinds in different times and places thereby informing and directing men how to act with respect to distant and future things as well as near and present ones the compounding and arranging part of this is offered as analogous to constructing sentences out of words there will soon be a good deal more about this these are your views as well as mine and their consequence is that you have as much reason to think god speaks to your eyes as you can have for thinking that any given person speaks to your ears i cant help thinking that some fallacy runs throughout this whole line of argument though i cant easily put a finger on it it seems to me that every other sense has as good a claim as vision to be called a language smells and tastes for example are signs that inform us of other qualities to which they have neither resemblance nor necessary connection certainly they are signs there is a general concept of sign that covers the parts of language as well as all those other signs but equally certainly not all signs are languagenot even all significant sounds such as the natural cries of animals or the inarticulate sounds and interjections of men the true nature of language consists in the articulation combination variety copiousness extensive and general use and easy application of signsand all of these are commonly found in vision as well as in languages more conventionally socalled other senses may indeed provide signs but those signs have no more right to be thought to be a language than inarticulate sounds such as a pained grunt or a surprised whistle wait let me see in language the signs are arbitrary arent they they are and consequently they dont always suggest real matters of fact because people sometimes say things that are false whereas this natural language of vision as you call it or these visible signs do always suggest things in the same uniform way and have the same constant regular connection with matters of fact which seems to imply that their connection with what they signify is necessary which would mean they werent a language after all according to the definition of language that we have been working with how do you solve this objection you can solve it yourself with the help of a picture or a mirror youre right i see there is nothing in it when i look at a certain picture i receive a visual statement that theres a yellow tiger on that wall and there isnt when i look in a mirror i receive a visual statement that theres a bearded old man staring at me and there isnt this simple point really does counter alciphrons view that visual statements are necessarily connected with tangible realities i dont know what else to say about this view of yours other than that its so odd and contrary to my way of thinking that ill never assent to it remember please your own lectures about prejudice and apply them in the present case maybe they will help you to follow where reason leads and to be suspicious of notions that are strongly riveted without ever having been examined i indignantly reject the suspicion of prejudice im not speaking only for myself i know a club of extremely able men the freest from prejudice of any men alive who hate the notion of a god and im sure would be very able to untie this knot dion our narrator speaks up here remarking that alciphrons reliance on others is unworthy of him and of his principles as well as being a dangerous tactic crito then weighs in with scornful colourful offensive remarks about how freethinkers insincerely vary their standards of intellectual conduct according to what company they are in a nasty quarrel is in the making but alciphron calls a halt to this irksome and needless discourse he continues for my part i am a friend to inquiry i am willing that reason should have its full and free scope i build on no mans authority for my part denying a god doesnt serve my selfinterest in any way any man may believe or not believe a god as he pleases still euphranor must allow me to stare a little at his conclusions the conclusions are yours as much as mine for you were led to them by your own concessions you it seems stare to find that god is not far from every one of us and that in him we live and move and have our being acts first thing this morning you thought it strange that god should leave himself without a witness do you now think it strange that the witness should be so full and clear i must say i do i was aware of a certain metaphysical hypothesis to the effect that we see all things in god by the union of the human soul with the intelligible substance of the deity which neither i nor anyone else could make sense of this refers to a thesis of malebranches for sober hardthoughtout reasons he held that any ideas that come before our minds are literally godsnot ideas that he causes in us but ideas that he has himself in his mind the phrase intelligible substance of the deity is typical malebranchespeak but i never dreamed that anyone would claim that we see god with our own physical eyes as plainly as we see any human person whatsoever and that he daily speaks to our senses in a plain and clear dialect as for that metaphysical hypothesis i can make no more of it than you can but i think its clear that this optical language that euphranor has been describing has a necessary connection with knowledge wisdom and goodness it is equivalent to a constant creation indicating an immediate act of power and providence it cant be accounted for on mechanical principles by atoms or attractions or emanations of gases heres what we have the instantaneous production and reproduction of ever so many signscombined dissolved transposed diversified and adapted to an endless variety of purposesconstantly shifting in ways that are suitable to the circumstances incapable of being explained by the laws of motion chance fate or any other such blind source of energy this presents and testifies to the immediate operation of a spirit or thinking beinga wise good and provident spirit who directs and rules and governs the world some philosophers being convinced of the wisdom and power of the creator from the structure and workings of organic bodies and the orderly system of the world nevertheless thought that god left this system with all its parts and contents well adjusted and set in motion as an artisan leaves a clock to run on its own for a certain period but this visual language proves that there is not merely a creator but a caring governor who is actually and intimately present to us attentive to all our interests and to all our movements watching our conduct and attending to our minutest actions and designs throughout the whole course of our livesinforming scolding and directing us incessantly in a most evident and perceptible manner this is truly wonderful and isnt it amazing that men should be surrounded by such a wonder without reflecting on it theres something divine and admirable in this language addressed to our eyes something that may well awaken the mind and deserve its utmost attention it is learned with so little trouble it expresses the differences of things so clearly and aptly it instructs so quickly and clearly conveying by one glance a greater variety of bits of advice and a clearer knowledge of things than could be had from several hours of talk and along with informing it also amuses and entertains the mind with such unique pleasure and delight it is of excellent use in giving stability and permanence to human discourse in recording sounds and bestowing life on dead languages enabling us to write and read and thus to converse with men of remote ages and countries and it answers so precisely to our purposes and needs informing us more clearly about objects whose nearness and size make them likely to do the most harm or good to our bodies and less exactly in proportion as their smallness or distance from us makes them of less concern to us and yet men arent much impressed by these strange things but they arent strange theyre familiar and thats why they are overlooked things that rarely happen make an impression when they do whereas frequency lessens our admiration for things that may in themselves be ever so admirable so an ordinary person who isnt much given to thinking and meditating would probably be more convinced of the existence of a god by one single sentence heard once in his life coming down from the sky than by all the experience he has had of this visual language contrived with such exquisite skill so constantly addressed to his eyes and so plainly declaring the nearness wisdom and providence of the person who is addressing us but i still cant help wondering how men should be so little surprised or amazed by this visual faculty if it really is of such a surprising and amazing nature lets suppose a nation of men blind from birth among whom a stranger arrives the only sighted man in all the country lets suppose that this stranger travels with some of the natives and that he foretells that if they walk straight forward in half an hour theyll meet men or cattle or come to a house that if they make a right turn and then keep walking they will in a few minutes be in danger of falling down a precipice that by walking to the left they will in suchandsuch a time arrive at a river a wood or a mountain what do you think wouldnt they be infinitely surprised that someone who had never been in their country before knew it so much better than themselves and wouldnt those predictions seem to them as inexplicable and incredible as prophecy would to a minute philosopher i cant deny it but it seems to require intense thought to be able to sort out a prejudice that has been so long forming to get over the vulgar error of thinking there are ideas that are common to both senses and thus to be able to distinguish the objects of sight from those of touch these two kinds of objects haveif i may put it this wayblended together so intimately in our imagination that its extremely difficult for us to think ourselves into the precise state one of those men would be in if he were enabled to see but i believe it can be done and it might seem worth the trouble of a little thinking especially to men who are specially and intensively engaged in thinking unravelling prejudices and exposing mistakes i admit frankly that i cant find my way out of this mazeie i cant think myself into the frame of mind of the bornblind man who just begins to seeand i would be glad to be guided out of it by those who see better than i do crito quotes a biblical passage he is reminded of then a servant announces that tea is ready they go inside for it and find lysicles already there i am glad to have found my second said alciphron a fresh man to maintain our common cause which im sure lysicles will think has suffered through his absence why so i have been drawn into some concessions you wont like let me know what they are well that there is such a thing as a god and that his existence is very certain bless me how did you come to entertain such a wild idea well you know we claim to follow reason wherever it leads in brief i have been reasoned into it reasoned you should say baffled with words bewildered by sophistry would you like to hear the reasoning that led alciphron and me step by step so that we can examine whether or not it is sophistry im easy about that i can guess everything that can be said on that topic it will be my business to help my friend out whatever arguments drew him in will you admit the premises and deny the conclusions what if i admit the conclusion what will you grant that there is a god perhaps i may then we are agreed perhaps not o lysicles you are a subtle adversary i dont know what you are up to well the existence of god is basically an affair of little importance and a man may make this concession without yielding much what really matters is what sense the word god is to be given even the epicureans allowed that there are gods but then they were idle gods with no concern about human affairs hobbes allowed a corporeal god and spinoza held that the universe is god yet nobody doubts that these men were staunch freethinkers i could wish indeed that the word god were entirely dropped because in most minds it is coupled with a sort of superstitious awe the very root of all religion still i dont much mind if the name god is retained and the existence of god acceptedin any sense except that of a mind that knows everything and surveys human actionslike some judge or magistratewith infinite care and intelligence the belief in god in this sense fills a mans mind with worries puts him under constraints and embitters his very being but the belief in god in another sense can be free of anything much in the way of bad consequences i know this was the opinion of our great diagoras who told me he would never have taken the trouble to discover a demonstration that there is no god if the generally accepted notion of god had been the one that some of the church fathers and scholastics had and what was that well diagoras had discovered that once upon a time the deepest and most theoretically serious theologians found that they couldnt reconcile the attributes of god when taken in the ordinary sense or in any known sense with human reason and how the world shows itself to be so they adopted the doctrine that the words knowledge wisdom goodness and so on when applied to god must be understood in a quite different sense from what they mean in ordinary language and from anything that we can form a notion of or conceive this let them easily answer any objections that might be made against the attributes of god all they had to do was to deny that those attributes belonged to god in this or that or any known particular sense which amounted to denying that they belonged to him at all and by denying the attributes of god they in effect denied his existence though they may not have been aware of that heres an example suppose a man were to object that future contingencies are inconsistent with gods foreknowledge because certain knowledge of something that is uncertain is selfcontradictory the theologians i am talking about had an easy answer to ready at hand namely what you say may be true with respect to knowledge taken in the ordinary sense or in any sense that we can possibly form any notion of but theres no inconsistency between the contingent nature of things and divine foreknowledge taken to signify something of which we know nothingsomething that serves god in the way that what we understand by knowledge serves us the difference between these two is not one of quantity or degree of perfection they differ altogether totally in kind as light differs from sound actually they differ even more than that because light and sound are both sensations whereas knowledge in god has no sort of resemblance or agreement with any notion that man can form of knowledge the same can be said of all the other attributes which in this way can be equally reconciled with everything or with nothing any thinking person must see this is cutting knots rather than untying them for something cant be reconciled with the divine attributes when these attributes themselves are denied of god in every intelligible sense so that the very notion of god is taken away and nothing is left but the name without any meaning attached to it in short the belief that there is an unknown subject of attributes that are absolutely unknown is a very innocent doctrine which is why the acute diagoras who saw this was perfectly delighted with this system if this could once make its way and be accepted in the world diagoras said that would put an end to all natural or rational religion which is the basis of both the jewish and the christian religions for someone who comes to god or goes into the church of god must first believe that there is a god in some intelligible sense not merely that there is something in general without any proper notioneven a very inadequate oneof any of its qualities or attributes for this something in general could be fate or chaos or creative nature or anything else as well as it could be god and its no help to say there is something in this unknown being that is analogous to knowledge and goodness ie something that produces the effects that we cant conceive to be produced by men without knowledge and goodness for this is still to surrender to the atheist side against the theists the dispute has never been over whether there is a principle roughly something absolutely basic or primal a first cause because all philosophers right back to the presocratics have agreed that there is what they havent agreed about is whether these are true or false this principle is a thinking intelligent being the order beauty and usefulness that we see in natural effects couldnt be produced by anything but a mind or intelligence properly socalled the first cause must have had true real proper knowledge so we on the atheist side who think that all three are false will accept that all the natural effects that are vulgarly ascribed to knowledge and wisdom come from a being in which there is no knowledge or wisdom properly socalled at all but only something else that causes the things that men in their ignorance ascribe to what they call knowledge and wisdom and understanding you may be surprised to hear a man of pleasure like me philosophizing in this context but theres a lot to be gained from conversation with able men its a shortcut to knowledge and saves one from the drudgery of reading and thinking so now we have granted to you that there is a god in this indefinite sensewhat use can you make of this concession you cant argue from unknown attributes you cant prove that god should be loved for his goodness feared for his justice or respected for his knowledge we agree that all those consequences would follow from gods having goodness and the rest with those names taken in intelligible senses but we deny that any consequences follow from attributes admitted in no particular sense or in a sense that none of us understand thus since from such an account of god nothing can be inferred about conscience or worship or religion you are welcome to the account and so as not to stand out from the crowd well use the name god too and so snap theres an end of atheism this account of a deity is new to me i dont like it so ill leave it to be maintained by those who do its not new to me a while ago i heard a minute philosopher triumph on this very point and that set me to inquiring what basis there is for it in the church fathers or the scholastics crito now embarks on a long and learned lecture starting with the early history of this idea that knowledge etc are not to be applied to god in the same sense as they are to men just how early its start was is not clear because issues arise about the true authorship of various works it is clear that the thesis wasnt meant in the flatteningout way in which lysicles has understood it but rather than going into all those details we can safely jump ahead to this thomas aquinas expresses his sense of this matter as follows all perfections that created things get from god are also perfections of god in a certain higher sense which the scholastics express by saying that those perfections are in god eminently so whenever we attribute to god a perfection to which we give a name borrowed from that perfection in created things we must exclude from the names meaning everything that belongs to the imperfect way in which that attribute is found in created things from this he infers that knowledge in god is not a habit or disposition but a pure act and although suarez joins other scholastics in teaching that the mind of man conceives knowledge and will to be faculties or operations of god only by analogy to created things yet he plainly declares this not a quotation from him when it is said that knowledge is not properly in god this must be understood to be referring to knowledge including imperfection eg conceptual knowledge or some other imperfect kind of knowledge that created beings have none of those imperfections in the knowledge of men or angels is a feature of knowledge as such there can be knowledge that doesnt have them so from the premise that god doesnt have such imperfectionincluding knowledge it doesnt follow that knowledge in the proper sense of knowledge cant be attributed to god and of knowledge taken in a general way for the clear evident understanding of all truth he expressly affirms that this is in god and that this was never denied by any philosopher who believed in a god at that time the scholastics generally held that even being should be attributed to god and to created things only analogically that is they held that godthe supreme independent selfcausing cause and source of all beingsmustnt be supposed to exist in the same sense of exist as that in which created beings exist not that he exists less truly or properly than they do but only that he exists in a more eminent and perfect manner i wouldnt want anyone to be led through a misunderstanding of scholastics use of the terms analogy and analogical to the view that we cant get any distance towards forming a true and proper notion of attributes that we apply to god by analogy so let us look into the true sense and meaning of those words everyone knows that analogy is a greek word used by mathematicians to signify a likeness of proportions for example when we observe that two is to six as three is to nine this equality of proportion is called analogy and although the word proportion strictly signifies only the relation of one quantity to another in a looser derived sense it has been applied to signify every other kind of relational property and the term analogy has been broadened along with proportion so that now it signifies likeness or equality in respect of all relations or relational properties whatsoever and so we find the scholastics telling us there is an analogy between intellect and sight because intellect is to the mind what sight is to the body and that he who governs the state is analogous to him who steers a ship so that a monarch is analogically called a pilot being to the state what a pilot is to his vessel theres something else that may help to clear this matter up namely the scholastics distinction between two kinds of analogy metaphorical and proper the bible has plenty of examples of metaphorical analogy attributing human parts and passions to god when he is represented as having a finger an eye or an ear when he is said to repent to be angry or grieved everyone sees that the analogy is merely metaphorical such things as parts and passions properly understood essentially involve some imperfection so when it is said the finger of god appears in some event men of common sense mean only that the event in question is as truly ascribed to god as the works wrought by human fingers are ascribed to man and similarly with the rest the phrase the rest is berkeleys if it is meant to cover anger and grief as well as eyes and ears crito doesnt explain how but the case is different when wisdom and knowledge are attributed to god passions and senses as such involve defects but theres no defect in knowledge as such so it is all right to attribute knowledge to god therefore in the proper formal meaning of the word knowledge as long as it is attributed in a way that is proportional to gods infinite nature so we can say that just as god is infinitely above man so his knowledge is infinitely above mans thus this doctrine of analogical perfections in god or our knowing god by analogy seems to be misunderstood by those who infer from it that we cant form any direct or proper notion however inadequate of knowledge or wisdom as these occur in god and now gentlemen you may think i should ask your pardon for having dwelt so long its twice as long in the original on a point of metaphysics and introduced into good company such unpolished and unfashionable writers as the scholastics but lysicles gave me the opening so i leave him to answer for it i never dreamed of this dry lecture if i have opened up the discussion to these scholarly matters by my unfortunate mention of the scholastics it was my first fault of that kind and i promise it will be my last i dont enjoy involvement with crabbed authors of any sort its true that occasionally one finds a good idea in what we call dry writers an example was the idea i was speaking of which i must admit struck my fancy but for writers such as these we have the likes of prodicus and diagoras who read obsolete books and save the rest of us that trouble so you pin your faith on them only for some odd opinions and matters of fact and critical points but i could safely rely on them for more than that we know the men in whom we put our trust they are judicious and honest and have no aim except to get to the truth and im sure that some author or other has maintained the view i presented in the same sense as diagoras reported it that may be but it never was a generally accepted view and it never will be so long as men believe in a god that is because the same arguments that there was a first cause also prove that the first cause was intelligent using intelligent in its proper sense and also wise and good using those words too in their true and formal meanings but for your part alciphron you have been fully convinced that god is a thinking intelligent being in the same sense as other spirits though not in the same imperfect manner or degree well i do have some worries about that with knowledge you infer perhaps imply wisdom and with wisdom you infer goodness and i cant see that it is either wise or good to enact laws that cant ever be obeyed does anyone find fault with the exactness of geometrical rules because noone in practice can achieve it the perfection of a rule is useful even if it isnt reached many can approach something that noone actually reaches but how is it possible to conceive of god as so good when man is so wicked there is some plausibility perhaps to the idea that a little soft shadowing of evil sets off the bright and luminous parts of the creation and so contributes to the beauty of the whole piece here painting but you cant account in that way for such large black blots as those the world has that there should be so much vice and so little virtue on earth and that the laws of gods kingdom should be so poorly observed by his subjectsthats what cant be reconciled with the surpassing wisdom and goodness of the supreme monarch tell me alciphron would you argue that a state was ill administered or judge the manners of its citizens on the evidence of the disorders committed in the gaol or dungeon i would not well for all we know this spot with its few sinners may be as small a proportion of the universe of thinking beings as a dungeon is of a kingdom we seem to get our views not only from revelation but also from ordinary plain senseperception which leads us to infer by analogy with the world as we see it that there are innumerable orders of intelligent beings happier and more perfect than man our life is very short and this earthly globe where we live is a mere point in comparison with the whole system of gods creation we are indeed dazzled by the glory and grandeur of some things here below because we know no better but im inclined to believe that if we knew what it was to be an angel for one hour we would return to this worldeven to sit on the brightest throne in itwith vastly more loathing and reluctance than we would now descend into a loathsome dungeon or sepulchre to me it seems natural that such a weak passionate and shortsighted creature as man is always liable to worries of one kind or other but as hethis very same creatureis also apt to be overpositive in judging and overhasty in drawing conclusions these difficulties and doubts about gods conduct are turned into objections to his existence and so men end up arguing from their own defects against the divine perfections and although the views and temperaments of men are different and often opposite you can sometimes see them deduce the same atheistic conclusion from contrary premises two minute philosophers whom i know used to argue each from his own temperament against a providence caring god one of them a badtempered and vindictive man said that he couldnt believe in providence because london had not been swallowed up or consumed by fire from heaven the reason he gave was that the streets are full of people who show no belief in god or worship of him except perpetually praying that he would damn rot sink and confound them that sentence from perpetually to the end is as berkeley wrote it the original like this version seems to speak of people calling down gods wrath on themselves the other an idle goodtempered fellow concluded that there cant be such a thing as providence because an utterly wise being would have to have better things to do than attending to the prayers and actions and little interests of mankind after all if god has no passions how can it be true that vengeance is his or how can he be said to be jealous of his glory for i the lord thy god am a jealous god exodus in this context jealous of his glory means resentful of anything that denies or belittles his glory we believe that god executes vengeance without revenge and is jealous without weakness just as the mind of man sees without eyes and grasps without hands as when we say i see the flaw in your argument and i grasp the situation its time to end this part of the discussion so well grant that there is a god in this dispassionate sensebut then what of it what does this have to do with religion or divine worship what is the point of all these prayers and praises and thanksgivings and psalmsinging that the foolish vulgar call serving god what sense is there in all these things what use are they what are they for we worship god we praise and pray to him not because we think that he is proud of our worship or fond of our praise or prayers and affected by them as mankind are or because we think that our service can contribute in some measure to his happiness or good but because it is good for us to be disposed to relate in that way to god because our worship is just and right suitable to the nature of things and fitting to the way we relate to our supreme lord and governor if it is good for us to worship god it would seem that the christian religion which claims to teach men the knowledge and worship of god is of some use and benefit to mankind doubtless unless i am very much mistaken you wont be able to show that that is right it is now nearly dinnertime lets stop our conversation for now and pick it up again tomorrow morning fifth dialogue saturday dion reports that on the next morning friday the group walked to a charming spot in the countryside and were settling down for an allday conversation when they were interrupted by a clamour including the barking of hounds and the roaring of country squires it was a foxhunt in which one of the hunters had fallen from his horse and broken a rib the day was spent in getting him to critos home and caring for him there sending for a surgeon feeding the foxhunters who with loud rustic mirth gave proof of their religion and loyalty by the healths they drank and so on the following morning the discussiongroup returned to the place where they had been when the hunt and accident interrupted them now lysicles being a fastidiously elegant man and a witty one was utterly contemptuous of the rough manners and conversation of the foxhunters and was angry that he had lost so many hours in their company i cheered myself up he said by the thought that there were no longer any of this species among us meaning presumably moving in the social circles in which i move its strange that men should be entertained by such uncouth noise and hurry or find pleasure in the society of dogs and horses how much more elegant the diversions of the town are foxhunters replied euphranor in a certain way resemble freethinkers the foxhunters employ their animal faculties in pursuit of game and you gentlemen employ your intellectual faculties in the pursuit of truth its the same sort of pastime though the objects are different i would rather be compared to any brute on earth than a rational brute in this context rational is code for human lysicles is saying that he would rather be compared to subhuman animal than to a brutish human being such as a foxhunter that means that youd have been less displeased with my friend pythocles whom i have heard compare the common sort of minute philosophers not to the hunters but to the hounds he gave this reason youll often see among the dogs a loud babbler with a bad nose lead the unskilful part of the pack who all rush after him without following any scent of their own any more than the herd of freethinkers follow their own reason but pythocles was a blunt man and he cant ever have encountered such reasoners among the freethinkers as you gentlemen who can sit so long at an argument dispute every inch of ground and yet know when to make a reasonable concession i dont know how it happened but it seems that alciphron has been making concessions for me as well as for himself speaking for myself im not quite so ready to concede things but i dont want to be a standout either truly alciphron when i consider how far we have come and how far we are agreed i think its likely that well eventually come to be in complete agreement you have granted that a life of virtue is to be preferred as the kind of life most conducive both to the general good of mankind and to the good of individuals and you allow that the beauty of virtue isnt by itself a strong enough motive to get mankind to live virtuously this led you to agree that the belief in a god would be very useful in the world and that therefore you would be disposed to accept any reasonable proof of his existence such a proof has been given and you have accepted it well then if we admit a divinity why not divine worship and if worship why not religion to teach this worship and if some religion why not the christian one if we cant find a better one and christianity is already established by the laws of our country and handed down to us from our forefathers are we to believe in a god yet not pray to him for future benefits or thank him for past ones not trust in his protection or love his goodness or praise his wisdom or marvel at his power and if these things are to be done can we do them in any way that is more suitable to the dignity of god and man than the way laid down by the christian religion i am not perhaps altogether sure that religion must be absolutely bad for the public but i hate to see religion walk hand in hand with considerations of government and social order i dont like to see human rights tied to religion i am not in favour of any kind of governing high priest he reels off a list of countries that have had such i knew a witty freethinker hes dead now who was a great admirer of the ancient druids he detested the present established religion but used to say that he would like to see the druids and their religion restored as it flourished in gaul and britain in ancient times it would be a good thing he thought that there should be a number of thoughtful men set apart to preserve knowledge of arts and sciences to educate youth and to teach men the immortality of the soul and the moral virtues that is what the ancient druids did he said and id be glad to see them once more established among us how would you like it alciphron that priests should have power to decide all controversies settle disputes about property distribute rewards and punishments that anyone who didnt submit to their decrees should be excommunicated regarded with disgust excluded from all honours and privileges and deprived of the common benefit of the laws and that from time to time a number of laymen should be crammed together in a wickerwork idol and burned to death as an offering to their pagan gods how would you like living under such priests and such a religion not at all such a state of affairs would be utterly unacceptable to freethinkers but thats what the druids and their religion were like if we can trust cæsars account of them im now more than ever convinced that there ought to be no such thing as an established religion of any kind certainly all the nations of the world have until now been out of their wits even the atheniansthe wisest and freest people on earthhad whoknowswhat foolish attachment to their established church they offered it seems a monetary reward to whoever would kill diagoras of melos a freethinking contemporary who laughed at their mysteries and protagoras another of the same sort narrowly escaped being put to death for writing something that seemed to contradict their accepted notions of the gods thats how our noble sect was treated in ancient athens and i have no doubt that your druids would have sacrificed many a holocaust berkeleys word of freethinkers i wouldnt give a farthing to exchange one religion for another away with them all together root and branch anything less than that isnt worth doing no druids or priests of any sort for me i see no place in the world for any of them this reminds me of how we ended our last philosophical conversation we agreed that next time we would return to the point we had then just begun on namely the use or benefit of the christian religion which alciphron challenged crito to show im all the readier to take this up because i dont think it is hard to do one great mark of christianitys truth is in my view its tendency to do good it seems to be the north star a principal guide to navigation at sea that guides all our judgments about practical matters including moral ones because these are always connected with universal benefit but to think straight about this matter we should try to do what lysicles did in an earlier conversation see pages taking account of things as a whole going as far as we possibly can in seeing how principles branch out into consequences in its four occurrences in this paragraph principle means source or seed see euphranor on pages we neednt pay much attention to the moods or whims or imaginary distresses of a few idle men whose ideas may be offended though their conscience cant be wounded what we have to do is to consider fairly the true interests of individuals as well as of human society now as is evident to anyone who gets his notion of it from the gospel the christian religion is a fountain of light joy and peace a source of faith hope and charity so it has to be a principle of happiness and virtue youd have to be blind not to see that destroying the principles of good actions must destroy good actions as for someone who sees this and yet persists in trying to destroy the principlesif he isnt wicked who is it seems to me that any man who can see in some depth and some breadth must be aware of his own misery sinfulness and dependence perceive that this present world is not designed or adapted to make rational souls happy welcome the chance to get into a better state and be overjoyed to find that the road leading to that better state involves loving god and man practising every virtue living reasonably while we are here on earth proportioning the value we put on things to the value they actually have and using this world without misusing it thats what christianity requires it doesnt require the cynics nastiness or the numbness of the stoic can there be a higher ambition than to overcome the world or a wiser ambition than to subdue ourselves or a more comfortable doctrine than the forgiveness of sins or a more joyful prospect than that of having our low nature renovated and assimilated to the deity our being made fellowcitizens with angels and sons of god did pythagoreans or platonists or stoics ever propose to the mind of man purer means or a nobler end how much of our happiness depends on hope how totally is hope extinguished by the minute philosophy on the other hand how it is cherished and raised by the gospel let anyone who thinks seriously consider these things and then say which he thinks deserves better of mankindhe who recommends christianity or he who runs it down which does he think is likelier to lead a happy life to be a hopeful son an honest dealer a worthy patriothe who sincerely believes the gospel or he who doesnt believe a word of ithe who aims at being a child of god or he who is content to be known as one of epicuruss hogs just look at the characters and behaviour of average examples of the two sorts of men and then say which sort live in a way that accords best with the dictates of reason the preparer of this text asked anthony long uc berkeley for help with epicuruss hogs and this was part of his reply included with permission in the last verse of horaces little epistle to tibullus he describes himself to his fellow poet as a hog from epicuruss herd in his selfmocking context horace says that he has been observing the epicurean rule of living carefree for the day when you want to laugh you will see me sleek and fat in fine shape a hog horace knows that the true epicurean is not a voluptuary but he ironically echoes that stock prejudice its amazing to see how different things look when they are viewed in different lights or by different eyes the picture i have of religion is very unlike yours crito when i consider how it unmans the soul filling it with absurd dreams and slavish fears how it extinguishes the gentle passions inspiring a spirit of malice and rage and persecution when i see bitter resentments and unholy wrath in the very men who preach meekness and charity to others perhaps gentlemen of your sect think that religion is a subject beneath their attention but it seems to me that someone who sets about opposing any doctrine ought to know what he is opposing so ill tell you religion is the virtuous mean between disbelief and superstition we dont defend superstitious follies or the rage of bigots what we plead for is religion against irreligion law against confusion virtue against vice the hope of a christian against the despondency of an atheist i wont defend bitter resentments and unholy wrath in any man much less in a christian and least of all in a clergyman but if even the best christians sometimes produce outbursts of angry emotion that wont surprise anyone who reflects on the sarcasms and rudeness with which christians are treated by the minute philosophers for as cicero remarks somewhere an insult has a sting that a wise and good man will find it hard to bear he says it in latin but even if you sometimes see particular selfprofessed christians going to faulty extremes of any kind through passion and weakness while unbelievers of a calmer and cooler temperament sometimes behave better this contrast proves nothing in favour of disbelief or against christianity if a believer acts badly that is because of the man not of his belief and if an unbeliever does good that is because of the man not of his unbelief you wont deny that the clergy are regarded as physicians of the soul and that religion is a sort of medicine that they deal in and administer well now if very many souls are diseased and lost how can we think that their the physician is skillful or that his medicine is good its a common complaint that vice increases and men grow more wicked by the day if a shepherds flock is diseased or unsound who is to blame but the shepherd for neglecting them or not knowing how to cure them i have nothing but contempt for such shepherds such medicine and such physicians who do what all hucksters douse grave and elaborate speeches to peddle their pills to the people who are never the better for them it seems utterly reasonable to say that we should base our judgment of a physician and his medicine on the medicines effect on the sick but tell me lysicles would you judge a physician by the sick who take his medicine and follow his prescriptions or by those who dont doubtless by those who do well then what are we to say if great numbers of sick people refuse to take the medicine and instead of it take poison of a directly opposite nature that has been prescribed by others whose concern it is to discredit the physician and his medicines to block men from using them and to destroy their effect by drugs of their own is the physician to blame for the health troubles of those people by no means by the same line of argument doesnt it follow that the tendency of religious doctrines should be judged by the effects they produce not on all who hear them but only on those who accept or believe them it seems so if we are to be fair then shouldnt we judge the effects of religion by the religious of faith by believers of christianity by christians but i suspect there are very few of these sincere believers still wont it suffice to justify our principles if in proportion to the numbers who accept them and the strength of the faith with which they are accepted they produce good effects there may be more such believers than you think and if there arent isnt that the fault of those who make it their proclaimed purpose to lessen that number and who are those but the minute philosophers i say it is owing to the clergy themselves to the wickedness and corruption of clergymen and who denies that there may be minute philosophers even among the clergy in such a numerous a body there are bound to be men of all sorts but despite the cruel reproaches flung at the clergy by their enemies i think that any fairminded observer of men and things will be inclined to regard those reproaches as revealing faults in those who fling them as much as in the clergy at whom they are flungespecially if he takes into account the strident tone of those who censure the clergy i dont know enough of the world to claim to judge the virtue merit and wideranging accomplishments of men in the various professions and anyway i dont like the odious work of comparison but im willing to say this the clergy in this region where i live are by no means a disgrace to it on the contrary the people seem to profit greatly from their example and doctrine but supposing the clergy to be sinners and faulty as of course all men certainly are supposing you could detect here and there among them great crimes and vices what inference can you draw against the profession itself from its unworthy practitioners any more than the pride pedantry and bad lives of some philosophers creates a case against philosophy or those of lawyers a case against law it is certainly right to judge principles from their effects but then we must know them to be effects of those principles its precisely the method i have followed with respect to religion and the minute philosophy i can honestly say that i never knew any man or family become worse in proportion as they became religious but i have often observed that minute philosophy is the worst thing that can get into a family the easiest way to impoverish divide and disgrace it what i have observed by this same method of tracing causes from their effects is that the love of truth virtue and the happiness of mankind are good stuff for speeches but they arent what drive the clergy in their work if they were why would clergymen beas they all areso fond of abusing human reason disparaging natural religion and trashing the philosophers and scientists not all its true that a christian favours confining reason within its proper bounds but so does every reasonable man if we are forbidden to get involved with unprofitable questions empty philosophy and science that isnt really science it doesnt follow that all inquiries into profitable questions useful philosophy and real science are unlawful no man of good sense will make those inferences it is generally acknowledged that there is a natural religion that can be discovered and proved by the light of reason to those who are capable of such proofs but still it has to be admitted that precepts and oracles from heaven are incomparably better suited to the improvement of ordinary folk and the good of society than are the reasonings of philosophers thats why we dont find that natural or rational religion ever became the popular national religion of any country it cant be denied that in all heathen countries a world of fables and superstitious rites have been accepted under the colour of religion but i question whether they were as absurd and harmful as they are vulgarly said to have been because their respective legislators and magistrates see note on page must surely have thought them useful we dont deny that there was something useful in the old religions of rome and greece and some other pagan countries on the contrary we freely admit that they had some good effects on the people but these good effects came from the truths contained in those false religionsthe more truth a religion contained therefore the more useful it was i think youll have difficulty producing any useful truth any moral precept any healthy principle or notion in any nonchristian system of religion or philosophy that isnt included in the christian religion where it is either enforced by stronger motives or supported by better authority or carried to a higher point of perfection so you want us to think ourselves a finer people than the ancient greeks or romans if by finer you mean better perhaps we are and if we arent its not because we have the christian religion but because too many of us dont alciphron protests that critos perhaps we are is indefensible he contrasts cicero and brutus with an english patriot and seneca with one of our parsons crito replies that those great men were not the minute philosophers of their times and that the best of their principles were also christian ones he adds that the current standing of some of the great men of the ancient world is partly due to their undeniable personal merits partly to favourable publicity and not at all to their not being christian as for more recent times a careful look shows a great deal of moral improvement in europe under the influence of christianity for a start he says lets take a look at england i have heard much of the glorious light of the gospel and would be glad to see some effects of it in my own dear countrywhich is incidentally one of the most corrupt and profligate on earth despite the boasted purity of our religion but you wouldnt be showing much confidence in your religion if you compared it only with that of the barbarous heathen from whom we are derived if you want to honour your religion have the courage to make your comparison with the most renowned heathens of antiquity it is a common prejudice to despise the present and overrate remote times and things theres a touch of this in the judgments men make concerning the ancient greeks and romans those nations certainly did produce some noble spirits and great patterns of virtue but overall they seem to me to have been much inferior in real virtue and good morals to our corrupt and profligate nation so you called it to bring dishonour to our religion i wonder how you would choose to describe it when you wanted to do honour to the minute philosophy crito backs up his statement about the greeks and romans by citing examples the treatment of slaves and prisoners of war killing of unwanted children gladiators and also bacchanals and unbridled lusts of every kind these dont have parallels in contemporary england he says largely because of christianity alciphron replies that crito is overlooking facts that dont fit his views citing the inhumanity of that barbarous custom of duelling crito agrees that duelling is bad i shant make an apology for every goth that walks the streets with a determined purpose to murder any man who spits in his face or calls him a liar he goes on to say that christianity isnt responsible for this and alciphron says that thats irrelevant to the immediate present topic which is just a comparison of contemporary england with ancient greece and rome crito accepts this and returns to the comparison they were making saying that duelling isnt as bad as the common roman practice of poisoning thats very true duelling is not as general a nuisance as poisoning and its not so low either this crime if it is a crime has a good chance of holding on despite the law and the gospel the clergy never preach against it because they dont suffer from it personally and a man of honour mustnt appear to oppose the means of vindicating honour which is what duelling is you arent the first freethinker to say that the clergy are not given to preaching against duelling but in my view that remark itself is unfair and so is your statement about why the clergy stay away from this topic in effect half of their sermonsall that is said about charity brotherly love forbearance meekness and forgiving injuriesis directly against this wicked custom of duelling as for the claim that they never suffer from it themselves that is so far from true that one can make a case for saying that they suffer from it oftener than other men how can you make good on that claim the ferocity of this passage suggests that it reflects berkeleys own personal experiences of being bullied by cowards there are two kinds of bully the fighting and the tame both public nuisances the fighting bully is the more dangerous animal but there are far fewer of them than of tame bullies the tame bully exerts his talents against clergymen which the fighting bully never does the qualities of a man that make him count as a tame bully are natural rudeness combined with a delicate sense of dangermeaning danger to himself you see the fashionable custom of calling men to account for their behaviour ie challenging them to a duel has not lessened the force of inbred insolence and bad manners it has merely turned that force in a new direction so you can often see one of these tame bullies nearly bursting with offended pride and bad temper that he dares not express openly because he is afraid of being challenged to a duel until a parson comes his way providing reliefie giving his angry state a safe outlet but to return to our topic can you deny that the ancient romans were as famous for justice and integrity as todays men are for the opposite qualities you cant get the character of the romans from the opinions of cicero the actions of cato or a few shining episodes scattered through their history what you need to consider is the prevailing tenor of their lives and notions and then he says the picture changes and he goes on to cite examples of atrocious publicly approved conduct by the romans then i venture to say that if you take roman history from one end to the other and impartially compare it with our own you wont find the romans to be as good as you imagine or your countrymen to be as bad on the contrary i really do think that an unbiased eye will detect a vein of charity and justicean effect of christian principlesrunning through england today crito paused and alciphron spoke up addressing himself to euphranor and me it is natural for men according to their various upbringings and prejudices to form opposite judgments about the same things crito for instance imagines that religion has only salutary effects but if you appeal to the general experience and observation of other men youll find that the statement tantum religio potuit suadere malorum has grown into a proverb which says that religion is the root of evil it was said by lucretius and wasnt a generalization about religion speaking of agamemnons sacrifice of his daughter to a goddess in the hope of getting favourable winds for his attack on troy lucretius wrote so greatly was religion able to persuade a man to do evil not just among epicureans or other ancient heathens but among moderns speaking of the christian religion i think it is unreasonable to set up against the general concurring opinion of the world the observation of a particular person or a particular set of zealots whose prejudice sticks close to them and keeps mixing in with their judgmentszealots who read draw conclusions and observe with an eye not to discovering the truth but to defending their prejudice notice how nasty the tone has become this is said about crito in his presence but not addressed to him directly although i cant share alciphrons views i admire his skill and dexterity in argument sometimes he represents an opinions acceptance by people in general as a sure sign of its being wrong but when that doesnt suit his purposes he just as easily makes it a sure sign of truth but the fact that an irreligious proverb is used by the friends and admired authors of a minute philosopher doesnt imply that the proverb is something generally accepted still less that it is a truth based on the experience and observation of mankind and this one isnt a truth it would be as reasonable to think that darkness is a natural effect of sunshine as to think that sullen and furious passions come from the glad tidings and divine precepts of the gospel the sum and substance the scope and end of christs religion is the love of god and man all other doctrines and duties whether legal or moral are subordinate to this as parts of it means to it signs of it principles arising from it motives to adhere to it or effects of it tell me now how could evil or wickedness of any kind comes from such a source i dont say that there are no evil qualities in christians or that there are no good ones in minute philosophers but i do say this whatever evil there is in us our principles certainly lead to good and whatever good there may be in you it is most certain that your principles lead to evil it must be admitted that christianity looks handsome on the outside and many plausible things can be said in favour of the christian religion taken simply as we find it in the gospel he goes on to report the view of one of our great writers shaftesbury that the first christian preachers sneakily made christianity look goodall love charity meekness patience and so forthuntil they had converted much of the world and come to have political power and then they soon changed their appearance and showed cruelty ambition avarice and every bad quality crito responds that this is very stupid the first christian preachers died for their faith and yet ever since this religion has appeared in the world we have had eternal feuds factions massacres and wars the very reverse of that hymn with which it is introduced in the gospel glory be to god on high on earth peace goodwill towards men crito accepts this adds that christianity was often the pretext for these evils but insists that this doesnt mean it was their cause he then says that the evils of the christian era were matched and outnumbered by evils in prechristian times all these evils early and late were the common product of the passions and vices of mankind which are sometimes covered with the mask of religion by wicked men who have the form of godliness without the power of it this is so obviously true that im surprised that any man of sense knowledge and candour can doubt it he returns to ancient rome with more examples of horrors alciphron agrees that the romans had a high and fierce spirit which produced very bloody catastrophes but the ancient greeks he says were a civilized and gentle sort of men softened by arts and philosophy crito replies that the little states and cities of greece as alciphron calls them had their factions which persecuted each other with such treachery rage and malice that our factious folk are mere lambs by comparison for evidence of this he refers to thucydides history of the war between athens and sparta and he expresses contempt for freethinkers divers to the bottom of things fair inquirers and openers of eyes who are capable of such a gross mistake as sentimentalising ancient greece the rest of mankind we could more easily give up but as for the greeks men of the most refined genius express a high esteem of them not only on account of the qualities that you think fit to allow them but also for their virtues on the basis of the fullest and fairest observation i can make i think that if virtue stands for truth justice and gratitude there is incomparably more virtue right now in england than could ever be found in ancient greece he goes on about the ingratitude that some greek states showed to some of their citizens who had been benefactors and then moves on to this as for the source of the chief advantage of the greeks and romans and other nations that have made the greatest figure in the world im inclined to think it was their special reverence for the laws and institutions of their countries these inspired them with steadiness and courage and with the heartfelt and noble love of their country and what they understood to be their country was not confined by language or ethnic origin still less by geographical location their notion of their country also took in a certain system of manners customs notions rites and civil and religious laws i can see your drift you want us to revere the laws and religious institutions of our country well excuse us if we dont see fit to imitate the greeks or to be governed by any authority whatsoever im sure you dont if islam were established by law i dont doubt that the freethinkersthe very ones who applaud turkish maxims and manners so loudly that youd think they were ready to turn turkishwould be the first to protest against them but to return to our topic i agree that there always have been wars and factions in the world and that there always will be on some pretext or other as long as men are men but theres a specifically christian sort of war and sort of warrior one that the heathens had no notion of the noun divine has been replaced by theologian in this version but its occurrence in this paragraph and the next is left unaltered for reasons that youll see im talking about disputes in theology the wars and polemical divines the warriors which the world has been amazingly pestered with if you take their word for it they are teaching peace meekness harmony and whatnot but even a cursory look at how they behave shows them to have been all through the centuries the most contentious quarrelsome disagreeing crew that ever appeared on earth the skill and trickery the zeal and eagerness with which the scholastic divines those barbarians split hairs and quarrel over nonexistent imagined things is more absurd and a greater scandal to human reason than all the ambitious intrigues plots and politics of the court of ancient rome and makes me even angrier than those do if divines are quarrelsome its not because they are divine but because they are undivine and unchristian justice is a good thing and so is the art of healing yet men can be wronged in the administering of justice or poisoned in the giving of medicine but just as wrong cant be justice or an effect of justice and poison cant be medicine or an effect of medicine so also pride or strife cant be religion or an effect of religion having said that i agree that you can often see hotheaded bigots signing up with religious parties as well as political ones without being of credit or service to either for the next bit you need to remember that the scholastics were roman catholic philosophical theologians while berkeley was an anglican as for the scholastics in particular i dont think the christian religion has any need to defend them their doctrines or their method of handling them still however futile their views may be and however clumsy their language its simply not true that they sneer and scold and rant in their writings and they are so far from showing fury or passion that an impartial judge might rate them far ahead of the minute philosophers in keeping close to the point and in their tone and good manners but anyway if men are puzzled tangle with one another talk nonsense and quarrel about religion they do the same about law medicine politics and everything else that matters its not just in divinity that men run into disputes trickery nonsense and contradictions it also happens in the other professions i have mentioned and indeed in any pursuit where men have created abstract theory but this doesnt stop there being many excellent rules sound ideas and useful truths in all those professions in all disputes human emotions too often get stirred into the mix in proportion as the subject is thought to be more or less important but we oughtnt to confuse the cause of man with the cause of god or make human follies an objection to divine truths its easy to distinguish what looks like wisdom from above from what comes from the passion and weakness of men the distinction is so obvious that when someone doesnt draw it one might be tempted to think that this is a result not of ignorance but of something worse the hostile tone isnt improving the conduct we cite in objections to minute philosophers is a natural consequence of their principles anything they can cite in objections to us is an effect not of our principles but of human passion and frailty oh terrific so we must no longer cite in objections against christians the absurd contentions of councils the cruelty of inquisitions the ambition and powergrabbing of churchmen you can cite them as objections against christians but not against christianity if the divine author of our religion and his disciples have sowed a good seed and if together with this good seed the enemies of his gospel including the minute philosophers of all ages have sowed bad seeds from which weeds and thistles grow isnt it obvious that these bad weeds cant be blamed on the good seed or on those who sowed it he develops this point at considerable and not very interesting length alciphron responds by shifting to a different complaint the triviality and unimportance of much theological writing i shant undertake to vindicate theological writings as such a general defence of them would be as needless as a general accusation is groundless but let them speak for themselves and dont condemn them on the word of a minute philosopher anyway lets look at the worst case imagine a quarrelsome pedant in divinity who disputes and ruminates and writes on some refined point that is as useless and unintelligible as you please but then ask yourself what would have become of this man if he had been brought up to be a layman rather than a cleric mightnt he have employed himself in shifty business deals harassing lawsuits factions seditions and such like amusements doing much more harm to the public than he actually does with his useless theological studies the two pages between here and occupy five pages in the original they arent of much philosophical interest alciphron complains that in theological disputes what men lack in light they commonly make up in heat crito replies that in any branch of study when some isolated point is being looked into with great care that tends to generate an inflated sense of its importance but this is routine stuff and not special to theology alciphron complains that trivial theological squabbles are regarded as learning and the public takes an interest in them as though they were sporting events he objects to theological writings on stylistic grounds what man of sense or breeding would not detest the infection of longwinded pulpit eloquence or of that dry formal pedantic stiff and clumsy style that smells of the lamp and the college those who are foolish enough to admire the universities as centres of learning must think that my reproach smells of the college is a strange one but it is perfectly fair these days the ablest men agree that the universities are merely hotbeds of prejudice corruption barbarism and pedantry speaking for myself i find no fault with universities all i know is that i had three hundred pounds a year to spend in one of them and it was the happiest time of my life as for their books and style of writingi didnt have time to pay any attention to them whoever wants to pull weeds will never lack work theres no shortage of bad books on every subject i dont know what theological writings alciphron and his friends are familiar with but i venture to say that our english theologians include many writers who for breadth of learning solidity of content strength of argument and purity of style are not inferior to any writers in our language as for our universities which are of course imperfect any impartial observer will find that with all their flaws they are better than universities in other countries and much better than the mean picture that minute philosophers draw of them its natural that the loudest complaints against places of education come from those who have profited least by them crito mistakes the point i am relying on the authority not of a dunce or a rake or an absurd parent examples that crito has used but of the most accomplished critic this age has produced this great man characterizes men of the church and universities with the finest touches and most masterly pencil what do you think he calls them what why the black tribe magicians formalists pedants bearded boys and after having sufficiently derided and exploded them and their mean and crude learning he provides the most admirable models of good writing namely his own writings they have to be acknowledged as the finest things in our languageas i could easily convince you for i also have with me something by that noble writer after an exchange about a noble writer who is also a nobleman in fact shaftesbury alciphron takes a book from his pocket and starts to read a long flowery unclear passage in which idleness is praised as being better than busy greed it is quoted verbatim from shaftesburys book characteristics of etc except that berkeley mischievously puts it on the page as fifty lines blank verse of which this is typical but here a busy form solicits us active industrious watchful and despising pains and labour she wears the serious countenance of virtue but with features of anxiety and disquiet what ist she mutters what looks she on with such admiration and astonishment and so on until euphranor interrupts with a protest why should we interrupt our discussion to read a play it isnt a play or poetry alciphron replies but a famous modern critic moralizing in prose he goes on about this great mans discoveries and his writings euphranor comments sarcastically on the kind of man who offers to reform the style and taste of the age and alciphron not hearing the sarcasm continues enthusiastically about the admired critic of our times who has among other things argued that shakespeare milton and others have been greatly overrated euphranor asks what effect this great man has had on the public do they aspire to his sublimity or imitate his chaste unaffected style alciphron still naively enthusiastic says that the taste of the age is much mended crito gets in a slap at the writingstyle of minute philosophers and then shifts the conversation back towards where it was a few minutes ago when your great man tells us that ignorance and ill taste are due to the christian religion or the clergy i cant just take his word for it the truth is the opposite of that crito says in a speech that is summed up in this everyone who knows anything knows that we are indebted for our learning to the greek and latin tongues and that we are indebted for those tongues to our religion what else could have made foreign and dead languages in such demand among us alciphron speaks harshly of one sort of learning that is undoubtedly of christian origin and special to the universitieshe deplores the years that young people waste in acquiring the mysterious jargon of scholasticism and the further years they have to spend being untaught it by the world but what if this scholastic learning was not of christian but of moslem origin being derived from the arabs and what if this complaint about gentlemens spending several years in learning and unlearning this jargon is just a sham and this is said sarcastically a specimen of the truth and candour of certain minute philosophers surely it wouldnt be such a deplorable loss of time if a young gentleman spent a few months on the much despised and decried art of logica surplus of logic is by no means the prevailing nuisance of this age it is one thing to waste ones time learning and unlearning the barbarous terms ultrafine distinctions and longwinded sophistry of the scholastics its another to attain some exactness in defining and arguingthings that may be not altogether beneath the dignity even of a minute philosopher logic used to be regarded as its own objectie a selfsufficient subject all on its ownso that the art of reasoning instead of being transferred to things was aimed only at words and abstractions which produced a sort of leprosy in all branches of knowledge but those times are past and logiconce cultivated as the chief branch of knowledgeis now considered in another light it doesnt play anything like the part in the studies of young gentlemen at the universities that is attributed to it by those admirable reformers of religion and learning the minute philosophers crito goes on to say that the restoration of arts and civilized learning has been due to the influence of christians whom he names at length in the course of this he speaks of the great scholars who flourished on the other side of the alps in the golden age as the italians call it of pope leo the tenth and alciphron challenges this saying that the noble critic from whom he quoted a few minutes ago regards the italians as corrupters of true learning and erudition crito replies with some slighting remarks about the noble critic and surprisingly lysicles backs him up saying in effect that someone who writes so much about art and taste and critical skill oughtnt to write as badly as that man shaftesbury does in the course of some further skirmishing between alciphron and crito about whether and to what extent english culture is indebted to church or universities or ancient languages crito speaks of christianity as a generator of arts and sciences and also of the general sense of virtue and humanity and the belief in a providence and afterlife which all the argumentation of minute philosophers has not yet been able to abolish that remark brings the topic of christianityandculture to an end because alciphron replies it is strange that you still persist in arguing as though all the gentlemen of our sect were enemies to virtue and downright atheists when i have assured you that on the contrary we have among us a number of people who announce their support for virtue and natural religion and i have also assured you that i myself now argue on that basis how can you claim to support natural religion and yet be open enemies of christianity which is the only established religion that includes whatever is excellent in natural religion and which is the only means of making those precepts duties and notions become reverenced throughout the world suppose someone tried to persuade people that he was greatly in support of a particular earthly monarch that he loved and admired his government while at the same time he took every opportunity to express himself as a most bitter enemy of the very persons and methods that contributed most to the monarchs service and to making his dignity known and revered his laws observed or his dominion extendedwouldnt such a person be thought weak or insincere and isnt this just what minute philosophers like you do announce themselves as advocates of god and religion and yet do all they can to discredit christians and their worship admittedly you argue against christianity in one way that doesnt necessarily express hostility to religion as such namely by representing christianity as the cause of evil and wickedness in the world but that line of argument could be used with equal force against civil government food and drink every faculty and profession learning eloquence and even against human reason itself and even those of your sect who allow themselves to be called deists if their views are thoroughly examined will be found to include little religion in them as for gods providence watching over our conduct and dispensing blessings or hardships the immortality of the soul the last judgment and an afterlife with rewards and punishments those are great points of natural religion but how few if any of your freethinkers have tried to get men to have a serious sense of them how many go the opposite way trying to make the belief in them shaky or ridiculous when a mans declared principles and personal beliefs are utterly subversive of the things listed above anything he says about virtue piety and religion will be understood as merely playing safe and not being conspicuous frankly i have never had any liking for religion of any kind revealed or unrevealed whats unrevealed is natural religion and i venture to say the same for any gentlemen of our sect that i am acquainted with having never known any of them do anything as low as use the word god with reverence or express respect for piety or for any sort of worship he adds details about ways in which a minute philosopher may talk as though he had respect for christianity explaining that this is never to be taken seriously and literally then after all these arguments and ideas that beget one another without end here is my view in a nutshell my friends and i cant for the life of us see why man mightnt do very well and govern himself without any religion at all brutes do it and they are thought to be less capable than men you say that brutes have instincts senses appetites and passions to steer and conduct them well men have all those and also have reason that they can consult when they need to from these premises my friends and i conclude the road of human life is well enough lit without religion brutes dont have much power of thought and it is confined to particular things that are present to the animal so they are sufficiently restrained and kept in order by the force or faculties of other animals and by the skill of man and conscience and religion dont come into this in contrast with that human reason is a faculty of vast extent and power especially power to do mischief and conscience is a necessary balance to it and another point by the law of their nature nonhuman animals are pushed to one particular end or manner of existence without inclination or means either to deviate from that or to go beyond it but man has in him a will and higher principle through which he can pursue different or even contrary ends and he can fall short of or exceed the perfection natural to his species in this world just as he can either hand over control to his sensual appetites thereby degrading himself into the condition of brutes or else wellorder and improve his mind thereby upgrading himself into something resembling an angel man is the only animal with enough understanding to know his god whats the use of this knowledge if it isnt to ennoble man to raise him to a level where he is more like god and more in touch with god and what would the good of such ennoblement be if it ended with this life and how can these things happen without religion but we have already discussed at great length the topics of vice and virtue man and beast sense and intellect lysicles surely you dont want us to go back to where we were three or four days ago by no means i would much rather go forward and make an end as soon as possible but to save us all trouble let me tell you once for all that whatever you say youll never persuade me that so many able and agreeable men are in the wrong and a pack of snarling sour bigots in the right o lysicles i dont look for religion among bigots or for reason among libertines each kind disgrace their respective positionsthe bigot exerting an angry zeal for things that hardly matter and the libertine paying no attention to even the plainest and most important truths and surely whatever there is thats silly narrow and uncharitable in the bigot the same is in great measure to be attributed to the conceited ignorance and petulant irreligion of the libertine lysicles ignored this and rounded on alciphron i have always thought he said that nothing could be sillier than to think of destroying christianity by praising natural religion you cant consistently think well of one and poorly of the other because its obvious that natural religion needs the help of revealed religion if it is ever to be established and accepted anywhere except in the brains of a few idle speculative men i knew what your concessions would come to anyone with half an eye can see that the belief in god virtue an afterlife and such fine notions are the very basis and cornerstone of the christian religion give them this foundation to build on and youll soon see what superstructures our theologians will raise from it admit the truth and importance of those doctrines and you dont have to be a conjurer to prove from that the excellence and usefulness of the christian religion and then of course there must be priests to teach and propagate this useful religion and if there are priests provision will have to made for their maintenance enabling them to perform all their rites and ceremonies in a decent fashion and to keep their sacred character respected and the plain upshot of all this is that the monarch will ally himself with the priesthood in order to subdue the people so we have opened the gates to a long procession of ecclesiastical evils priestcraft hierarchy inquisition we have lost our liberty and property the nation has been put to vast expense simply to purchase bridles for our mouths and saddles for our backs he said this with some sharpness of tone and a scolding manner alciphron was upset but said nothing and showed confusion in his looks crito looked at euphranor and me with a smile then looking over at the two philosophers he said if youll allow me to intervene to prevent a rupture between old friends and brethren in opinion i would remark that in what lysicles has just said there is something right and something wrong it seems right to assert as he does that a real belief in natural religion will lead a man to approve of revealed religion but it is wrong to say that inquisitions tyranny and ruin must follow from this your freethinkersno offence meantseem to mistake where their strength lies they imagine strongly but reason weakly they are mighty in exaggeration but thin in argument isnt there some way to relieve them from the terror of that fierce and bloody animal an english parson wont it be enough to trim his talons without chopping off his fingers then they are such wonderful defenders of liberty and property he tells an antipope story to illustrate his thesis that we may see every day both things and notions being attributed to liberty and property that in fact dont have and arent meant to have anything to do with either of them really is it impossible for a man to be a christian without being a slave or to be a clergyman without having the principles of an inquisitor i am far from shielding and justifying the greed for domination or tyrannical power in ecclesiastics some who have been guilty of that have paid dearly for it and it is to be hoped they always will but once we have calmed the fury and folly of the ambitious bishop isnt it time to look see whether some evil mightnt come to the state from a different sourcethe overflowing zeal of an independent whig ie a believer in primitive christianity who is opposed to the established church of england ill tell you this without bothering to prove it the worst tyranny this nation ever felt was from the hands of patriots of that kind i dont know tyranny is a harsh word and is sometimes misapplied when spirited men with independent views create a ferment or make a change in the state those who lose by the changes are apt to consider things in one light and those who win to consider them in another in the mean time this is certainly good policy we should be sparing with our money and keep it for better uses than to spend on the church and religion what follows is a longish discussion of propertyrights the legal basis for the ownership of land by the church and so on then i can never hope crito to make you think that my schemes are reasonable you and i each argue correctly on our own principles and well never agree until we drop our principles and that cant be done by reasoning we all talk of just and right and wrong and public good and so on we use the same names but our notions and conclusions are very different perhaps diametrically opposite and yet the conclusions on each side may admit of clear proofs and be inferred by the same method of reasoning for instance the members of a club i belong to define man as sociable animal and so we dont count as men the human creatures of whom it can be said that we prefer their absence to their presence by this standard its clear that men of pleasure goodhumoured men and men of wit are the only human creatures who properly and truly count as men therefore whatever is conducive to good incomes for them is for the good of mankind and consequently very just and lawful even though it seems to bring loss or harm to other creatures i say seems because no real harm can be done in respect of life or property to those who dont know how to enjoy life and property we hold this on the basis of clear and well connected reasoning but others may view things in another light give different definitions draw different conclusions and perhaps regard as a wart or tumour of human nature what we think to be the top and flower of the creation from all which there must arise a very different system of morals politics rights and notions lysicles then swing into a jokey classification of men that someone invented in which kinds of men at given the names of kinds of animals thus according to this system the fishes are the men who swim in pleasure the beasts are dry drudging covetous rapacious folk and all those addicted to trouble and business like oxen and other dry land animals which spend their lives in labour and fatigue the birds are airy notional men enthusiasts projectors poets philosophers and such like if you ask me which species of mankind i like best i answer the flying fish ie a man of animal enjoyment with a mixture of whim thus you see we have our creeds and our systems just as more solemn folk do with this difference that our systems are not straitlaced not strapped on tightly but sit easy to be slipped off or on as the mood takes us or the occasion serves and now i can listen with the greatest equanimity imaginable to my opinions being argued against or refuted i wish all men were like that but youll find a sort of meni neednt name the sortthat cant endure having their opinions examined or their faults criticized they are against reason because reason is against them we freethinkers are all for liberty of conscience if our tenets are absurd we allow them to be freely argued against and inspected and by parity of reasoning we might hope to be allowed the same privilege regarding the opinions of other men o alciphron wares that cant stand the light are indeed suspect so whatever moves you to make this complaint i promise you that i never will up to now i have allowed your reason its full scope and ill always do so in the future but for the love of truth be candid and dont spend your strength and our time on matters that arent significant or are irrelevant to our topic or have been agreed between us we allow that tyranny and slavery are bad things but why should we fear them from the clergy at this time we agree that rites and ceremonies arent of central importance in religion but why should we ridicule things that in their own nature are not bad and may be good and that bear the stamp of supreme authority i freely admit that men in theology as well as other subjects get tangled in useless disputes and will probably go on doing so till the end of the world but why must all the human weakness and mistakes of clergymen be attributed to wicked designs why indiscriminately abuse their character and their beliefs is this like candour love of truth and freethinking granted bad temper and illbreeding can occasionally be found in the clergy but arent the same faults found in english laymen who have spent their lives in a secluded rural environment i grant that theres endless futility in the works of the scholastics but i deny that a volume of that does as much harm as a page of minute philosophy that weak or wicked men should by favour of the world creep into power and high positions in the churchtheres nothing surprising in that and it is natural to suppose that once they are in those positions they will behave like themselves but through all this it is obvious that what drives them in their unworthy achievements is not the gospel but the world not the spirit but the flesh not god but the devil we dont shrink from agreeing that nothing is more infamous than vice and ignorance in a clergyman nothing lower than a hypocrite more trivial than a pedant more cruel than an inquisitor but you should agree in your turn gentlemen that nothing is more ridiculous and absurd than for pedantic ignorant and corrupt men to throw the first stone at every shadow of their own defects and vices in other men when i think about the detestable state of slavery and superstition i feel my heart swelling to take in the utter blessing of independent liberty this is the sacred and high privilege the very life and health of our english constitution so you mustnt be surprised if we with a vigilant and searching eye guard it against the minutest appearance of evil you must even allow us to cut around it going deep and using a magnifying glass so as better to see and extirpate every least speck that appears in the freedom that we are careful to preserve and angry to see threatened as for unrestricted liberty i leave that to savages who i think are the only ones who have it but as for the reasonable legal liberty of our constitution i most heartily and sincerely wish it may to survive and flourish among us for ever he says that any amount of vigilance is justified if it stops attempts to change our free and gentle government into a slavish or severe one but how he demands can one get out of this any basis for an attack on religion there follows an discussion of rights of suppression alciphron reports a magistrate who was so hardpressed by freethinkers that he couldnt find anything to say in defence of his religion except that if ten million people inhabiting the same island wanted to have laws establishing religion in certain ways and ten thousand able men publicly sneered at those laws the ten million would be entitled to expel the ten thousand out of the island and what answer would you make to this remark of the magistrate the answer is obvious by the law of nature which is superior to any human institutions intelligence and knowledge have a right to command folly and ignorance i say that able men have by natural right a dominion over fools this doctrine however was never thoroughly understood until quite recently after conversation about a hardpressed individual magistrate alciphron will now revert to using the magistrate in the manner described in a note on page as a kind of shorthand for the lawmaking and lawenforcing authorities of the country a generation back hobbes and his followersthough otherwise very great mendeclared in favour of the religion of the magistrate probably because they were afraid of the magistrate but times have changed and the magistrate may now be afraid of us crito briefly comments on this and then launches into an anecdote that starts a brief and inconclusive discussion of the legal requirement that only professed christians could serve on juries then this much is certain the christian reformed religion is a principal part and cornerstone of our free constitution and i really think it is the only thing that makes us deserve freedom and makes us able to enjoy it freedom is either a blessing or a curse depending on how men use it if our religion were wiped out among us and the ideas that are regarded by freethinkers as prejudices of a christian education were erased from the minds of britons it seems to me that the best thing that could then happen would be the loss of our freedom a people who have such restless ambition such strength of feeling such enmity between factions so much at stake in contests such unrestricted licence of speech and press amid so much wealth and luxurythe only thing that has so far kept them from ruin are the hoary old wives tales he uses a latin phrase quoting persius as on page that you claim to be wiping out under the christian religion this nation has been greatly improved from being a sort of savages we have become civilized polished and learned we have made a decent and noble figure both at home and abroad and as our religion decreases i am afraid we shall be found to have declined so why should we persist in that dangerous experiment one would think crito that you had forgotten the many calamities caused by churchmen and religion and one would think that you had forgotten what we said this very day in answer to that objection i dont want to go on for ever saying the same things so ill make just three points if we reflect on the past state of the christian world and especially of our country with our feuds and factions that existed while we all had the same religioneg the war of the roses so violent and bloody and longwe may well suspect that the nastiness that has more recently shown up under the mask of religion would have broken out under some other pretext if religion hadnt been available it doesnt follow from anything you can say about our history that the evils accidentally arising from religion bear any proportion to the good effects it has really produced or to the evils it has prevented the best things can accidentally give rise to evil and such an accidental effect is not strictly speaking produced by the good thing itself but by some evil thingnot a part property or effect of itthat happens to coincide with it i think we have given enough discussion to the topic of todays session i must acknowledge that theres something in what crito has said about the usefulness of the christian religion lysicles may not like this but i owe it to my status as a fair impartial adversary to say this ill even admit that some of our sect are in favour of tolerating christianity i remember a meeting of a number of able men where after much debate we passed three resolutions the first was that no religion ought to be tolerated in the state but this on more mature thought was judged impracticable the second was that all religions should be tolerated but none looked on with favour except atheism but it was feared that this might make trouble among the lower sort of people the third resolution was that some religion or other should be established for the use of the vulgar after a long dispute about which religion this should be it was proposed that the present religion might be tolerated until a better one was found but while i grant that christianity is expedient i can never think it true while there are unanswerable objections to it is it all right if i present those at our next meeting to which we all agreed sixth dialogue monday in the original work this is by a considerable margin the longest of the dialogues but not in this version from which much of the philosophically uninteresting material has been cut dion reports that on the sunday the various people spent the day in their characteristic ways then the next morning we assembled at the same place as on saturday and when we were all seated i remarked that during the preceding week our discussion had been longer and less interrupted than i had ever known in town where mens hours are broken by visits business and amusementsso much so that anyone who settles for forming his ideas wholly from conversation must end up with ideas that are very shattered and incomplete and what have we achieved replied alciphron through all these continued discussions for my part i think that with regard to the main point that divides us the truth of the christian religion im just where i was at the outset i answered that so many points had been examined discussed and agreed between him and his adversaries that i hoped to see them eventually agreeing on everything for in the first place i said the principles and opinions of those who are called freethinkers or minute philosophers have been pretty clearly explained it has been also agreed that vice isnt beneficial to the nation in the way that some men imagine it is that virtue is highly useful to mankind but that the beauty of virtue is not enough on its own to get men to be virtuous that therefore the belief in a god and providence ought to be encouraged in the state and tolerated in good company as a useful notion and it has been proved that there is a god that it is reasonable to worship him and that the worship faith and principles prescribed by the christian religion are a good influence alciphrons reply was addressed to even if everything that dion has just said is true he said that doesnt move me an inch from where i was at the outset regarding the main point thats because nothing in all this proves the truth of the christian religion though each of the details dion has listed might create a prejudice in its favour so i must be on my guard against being a prejudiced personprejudiced in favour of christianity as a lover of truth i must look sharp and consider carefully every step i take you may remember alciphron that you suggested as todays topic certain difficulties and objections that you had to offer against the christian religion we are now ready to hear and consider anything of that kind that you think fit to produce atheism and the wrong idea of christianity as something harmful to mankind are great prejudices and a mans losing them may make him more apt to argue with candour and submit to reasonable proof but losing prejudices against an opinion as you have done isnt the same as acquiring a prejudice in its favour as you fear you may have done so we have reason to hope that youll be able to do justice to your cause without being uncritically in love with it after a selfcongratulatory opening alciphron says that he will do his best to share with those who are wandering lower down in the narrow dark paths of error the view of things that he has achieved from his lofty stand above the reach of prejudice then know then that each of the various groups of men has a faith and a religious system that sprouts from the common grain of enthusiasm that they all havea grain that is a basic ingredient in the mix of human nature each group tells of communication with the invisible world revelations from heaven divine oracles and the like when i consider all these claims with an impartial eye i cant possibly assent to them all and i find within myself something that restrains me from assenting to any of them im willing to go where i am led by common sense and the light of nature but the same reason that tells me to yield to rational proof forbids me to accept opinions without proof this holds in general against all revelationsall let this be counted as my first objection against the christian religion in particular this objection presupposes that theres no proof or reason for believing the christian revelation so if good reason can be assigned for such a belief the objection comes to nothing now i presume youll agree that a true and proper reason for believing a report is the authority of the person who makes it and the better his authority the sounder the claim his report has to our assent well now the authority of god is on all accounts the best so it is most reasonable to believe anything that comes from god meaning anything that is told to us by god i agree but then you have to prove that it does come from god and arent miracles and the fulfilment of prophecies joined with the excellence of its doctrine a sufficient proof that the christian religion came from god miracles would indeed prove something but what proof have we of these miracles proof of the same kind that we do havethe only kind we can haveof events that occurred long ago and far away we have authentic accounts passed down to us from eyewitnesses whom we cant conceive to have been tempted to deceive us by any human motive whatsoever why cant we because in giving these accounts they were acting contrary to their interests their prejudices and the very principles in which they had been nursed and brought up these accounts were confirmed by the unparalleled razing of the city of jerusalem and the scattering of the jewish nation which is an enduring testimony to the truth of the gospel particularly of the predictions of our blessed saviour for example and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh luke within less than a century these accounts were spread throughout the world and believed by great numbers of people they were also written down translated into numerous languages and handed down with the same respect and consent of christians in the most distant churches dont you see said alciphron staring straight at crito that all this depends on tradition and tradition believe me gives only a weak hold it is a chain whose first links may be stronger than steel and yet the last ones weak as wax and brittle as glass imagine a picture copied successively by a hundred painters each copying from the one before how like the original will the last copy be how lively and clear will an image be after a hundred reflections between two parallel mirrors thats how like and lively i think a faint vanishing tradition will be at the end of sixteen or seventeen centuries some men have a false heart others a wrong head and even when heart and head are both good memory may be treacherous something gets added something omitted something varied from the truth and the cumulative result of many such additions deductions and alterations through the centuriesthe bottom lineis quite different from what the tradition started with we can know ancient facts by oral tradition or written tradition and a written tradition may be either private kept in the hands of particular men or public recorded in public archives now as far as i can see all these three sorts of tradition agree in attesting to the genuine antiquity of the gospels and they are strengthened by supplementary evidence from rites instituted festivals observed and buildingschurches baptistries and sepulchresput up by ancient christians granting that your objection holds against oral tradition on its own i cant think it is so difficult to transcribe faithfully and once something has been put in writing it is secure against slips of memory and can with reasonable care be preserved intact for as long as the manuscript lastswhich we know from experience can be more than a thousand years a tradition of more than sixteen hundred years needs only two or three links in its chain he gives an example and despite the great length of time those links may be very sound and unbroken and no reasonable man will deny that an ancient manuscript may be as credible now as when it was first written we have it on good authorityand anyway it seems probablethat the first christians were careful to transcribe copies of the gospels and epistles for their private use and that other copies were preserved as public records in many churches throughout the world and that portions of them were constantly read in their assemblies what more could be said to prove the authenticity of the writings of classic authors or ancient records of any kind alciphron turned to euphranor and said silencing an adversary is different from convincing himdont you agree euphranor oh yes they are different but what i want is to be convinced its not so clear to me that you do look however willing a man is to be convinced he cant be convinced by probable arguments when there is a demonstration going the other way i agree that he cant well it is as obvious as demonstration can make it that no divine faith can possibly be built on tradition take the case of an honest credulous farmer who is drilled and lectured every sunday by his parish priest clearly its the parson he believes in not god all he knows about revelations doctrines and miracles is what the priest tells him he believes all this and his faith is purely human if you say he has the liturgy and the bible as foundation for his faith the difficulty still recurs as regards the liturgy he pins his faith on the civil magistrate as well as the ecclesiastic one and neither of those can claim divine inspiration as for the bible he takes both that and his prayerbook on trust from the printer who he believes made true editions from true copies so faith is at work here but faith in what faith in the priest in the magistrate in the printer editor transcriber none of whom can possibly be claimed to be divine i had the hint for this argument from cratylus its an arrow out of his quivera sharp one let me get hold of this arrow and try it out for myself suppose that your farmer hears a magistrate declare the law from the bench or suppose he reads it in a statute book do you think that the magistrate or the printer is the true and proper object of his faith and submission or do you acknowledge a higher authority on which their official actions are based again if you read a passage in the roman historian tacitus that you believe to be true would you say you assented to it on the authority of the printer or transcriber rather than the historian maybe maybe not i dont think im obliged to answer these questions all you are doing is to transfer the question from one subject to another what we were discussing was not law or nonreligious history but religious tradition and divine faith i can see well enough which way you are heading but ill never accept that you can solve one difficulty by starting up another o alciphron you expect others to stay fair and stand firm as you chose to express it on page while you pluck out their prejudices but you elude our grasp at every turn how can euphranor argue with you if not from your concessions and how can he know what they are unless you tell him my question admits of only two answers take your pick from one of the answers it will follow that by a parity of reason we can easily conceive how a man can have divine faith without ever feeling inspiration or seeing a miracle that is because it is equally possible for a mind to which divine revelation has come by some channeloral or scripturalto carry its thought and submission back up that channel to the source ending up with faith not in human but in divine authority its proper and true object being not the mechanisms and agents of the channel but rather the great origin itself from the other answer it will follow that youre introducing a general scepticism into human knowledge and smashing the hinges on which civil government and all the affairs of the world turn in short youll destroy human faith in order to get rid of divine i leave it to you to consider how well this goes with your announcement that you want to be convinced i really would be glad to be convinced one way or otherto come to some conclusion but i have so many objections in store that you shouldnt attach much weight to your dealing with one of them depend on it youll find me behaving like a gentleman and a lover of truth ill state my objections briefly and plainly and accept reasonable answers as fast as you can give them come on euphranor make the best case you can for your tradition you can never present as a constant and universal tradition one that is admitted to have been unknown or at best disputed in the church for several centuries and this is the case with the new testament for though we now have a settled canonmeaning that the church hierarchy eventually decided which books should be included in the new testament and which should noteveryone must see and admit that a tradition cant grow stronger by age and that anything that was uncertain in the earliest christian times cant be undoubted later on what do you say to this euphranor id like to get clearer about your meaning before i give an answer this objection of yours seems to presuppose that a tradition that has been constant and undisputed may be admitted as a proof but that where the tradition is defective the proof must be so too is this your meaning it is so the gospels and the epistles of st paul which were universally accepted from the start and have never since been doubted of by the church must be accepted as genuine and since these books contain all those points that are in controversy between you and me i dont need to argue with you about the authority of other books of the new testament that didnt come to be generally known and accepted in the church until later someone who assents to the undisputed books is no longer an unbeliever even if he doesnt regard the book of revelation or the epistles of st james or st jude or st peter or the last two epistles of st john as deserving to be in the canon the additional authority of these portions of the bible may carry weight in particular controversies between christians but it cant add anything to arguments against an unbeliever as such when you are a christian it will be time enough to argue about the status of those books and youll be nearer to being christian if your way there is shortened by the omission of that question for the present not as near as you may think despite all the fair and plausible things you may say about tradition when i consider the spirit of forgery that reigned in primitive times and reflect on the many gospels acts and epistles that were attributed to the apostles and then came to be recognized as spurious i confess that i cant help suspecting the whole bible tell me alciphron do you suspect that all platos writings are spurious because the dialogue on death is agreed to be so wont you accept any of ciceros writings as genuine because sigonius passed off a book that he had written as ciceros de consolatione and the deception succeeded for some time suppose i admit as genuine the works of cicero and plato that are commonly accepted as genuine what then why then i would want to know whether its balanced and impartial in a freethinker to measure the credibility nonreligious and sacred books by different standards let us know what we christians are allowed to work with when we argue with minute philosophers are we allowed the benefit of common maxims in logic and criticism if so then please give a reason why writings which in the style and manner and matter bear visible signs of being fraudulent and have accordingly been rejected by the church can be used as an argument against writings that have been universally accepted and handed down by a unanimous constant tradition i dont know of anything truly valuable that hasnt been counterfeited so your argument has a universal scope but something that tells against everything doesnt hold against anything it would seem as silly to reject the genuine writings of nonreligious authors because of the fakes as it would be unreasonable to suppose that the heretics and the many sects of christians wouldnt have included anyone capable of that kind of deceit i see no way of judging this at such a great distance of time it is all dark and doubtfulmere guesswork crito intervenes with a list of the reasons there are to trust the judgments of the church councils about what is spurious and what genuine alciphron then moves to a new point the bible is not well enough written to have been divinely inspired euphranor says that thats not decisive even an earthly monarch leaves the detailed wording of his laws and proclamations to his secretaries and clerks to express his sense in their own words also some roughness of style matches the roughness we find in largescale naturefor example there is never a really straight shorelinethough we do find geometrically exact shapes in the works of insects so it seems that a scrupulous attention to what men call the rules of art is not observed in the big productions of the author of nature alciphron replies that thats all right as regards niceties of grammar and expression but he still counts it against the divine inspiration idea that so much of the bible is written in a flat characterless boring way euphranor explodes o alciphron if i dared to follow my own judgment i would be apt to think there are noble beauties in the style of the bible in the narrative parts a simple and unaffected manner in the devotional and prophetic parts an animated and sublime style and in the doctrinal parts such an air of dignity and authority as seems to declare that their origin is divine but i shant set up my judgment on such a delicate matter against that of the wits and men of genius who are so plentiful in your sect nor am i tempted to do so because it seems to me that this latest argument of yours is worthless anyway something isnt shown not be the oracle of god by being delivered in a plain dress rather than in the enticing words of mans wisdom this may perhaps work as a defence of some simplicity and carelessness in writing but what defence can there be for nonsense crude nonsense i could easily give many examples because i once read the bible the whole way through looking for them look at the th psalm in this bible that i have here the author begins very grandly calling on all the inhabitants of the earth to listen and assuring them that his mouth will speak of wisdom and the meditation of his heart will be of understanding but he has no sooner finished this preface than he puts this senseless question wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the wickedness of my heels shall compass me about the wickedness of my heels what nonsense after such a solemn introduction i have naturally weak eyes and many things that i cant see are clearly seen by others so i dont conclude that a thing is absolutely invisible because i cant see it well it may be with my understanding the way it is with my eyes so i dont venture to declare a thing to be nonsense because i dont understand it he then goes through several interpretations that have been suggested for the passagetreating it as some kind of metaphor or as involving a hebrew idiom that we dont have in english crito chimes in with boring anecdotes about foreigners who have been misled by english idioms then euphranor resumes in this very psalm that you have picked on i should have thought that the good sense and morality contained in what follows the obscure bit would make a fairminded reader judge favorably concerning the original sense of the author in the part that he couldnt understand tell me alciphron when you are reading the classics and encounter something that you cant make sense of do you immediately conclude that it is nonsense by no means we have to expect difficulties to arise from different idioms old customs hints and allusions that may be clear at one time or place and obscure at another then why wont you judge passages of the bible by the same rule the sources of obscurity that you mention are all common both to religious and nonreligious writings and theres no doubt that in both sorts of writing the difficulties would vanish if we had a more detailed knowledge of the languages and circumstances he gives an examplea phrase in the book of jeremiah that looks odd unless one knows certain things about life near the river jordan here and there a difficult passage may be cleared up but there are many that cant be explained away by any exercise of human skill or ingenuity what do you say you about the discoveries that some of our learned writers have made of false citations from the old testament found in the new testament some new testament citations of passages in the old testament arent exactly accurate this has been known for centuries by christian writersit isnt a new discovery by minute philosophers it can be explained by errors of transcription and is of no great importance he develops this reply at some length concluding what can you infer from all this except that the design of the bible was not to give us exact knowledge of every detail and that the holy spirit didnt dictate every particle and syllable and miraculously preserve them from even the slightest alteration alciphron renews his attack on the bibles style and euphranor renews his defence then it wouldnt be a problem for me to admit that a popular incorrect style might serve the general ends of revelation as well as a more precise and exact one but i cant get over the obscurity if the supreme being had spoken to man it seems to me he would have spoken clearly and the word of god wouldnt need commentaries see qa note on page i you seem to think that obscurity is a defect but if it turns out not to be one that will be the end of this objection of yours ii now speech and style are instrumental in the conveying of thoughts and notions in getting knowledge opinion and assent iii and the perfection of an instrument should be measured by the use for which it is intended iv so something that is a defect in one instrument may be no defect in another for instance edged tools are in general designed to cut but because the uses of an axe and a razor are different its not a defect in an axe that it isnt as sharp as a razor or in the razor that it isnt as strong and heavy as an axe v so we can say in general that any instrument is perfect if it suits the purpose or intention of the person who uses it vi from which it seems to follow that no mans speech is defective in clearness if it isnt intelligible to all men but is intelligible enough to the ones the speaker intended should understand it or if it isnt equally clear in all parts or doesnt convey perfect knowledge all through but does convey an imperfect hint which is all the speaker intended vii so we need to know the intention of the speaker if we are to know whether his style is obscure through defect or design viii but no one man can possibly know all the ends and purposes of gods revelations so for all you know to the contrary the obscurity of some parts of the bible may fit quite well with a purpose that you dont know in which case they arent evidence that the bible doesnt come from god the books of the bible were written in ancient languages at distant times on various occasions and on very different subjects doesnt that make it reasonable to think that some parts or passages might have been clearly enough understood by those for whose use they were principally designed and yet seem obscure to us who speak another language and live at another time is it at all absurd or unsuitable to our ideas of god and man to suppose that god may reveal but be reserved about how much he reveals on certain remote and sublime subjects content to give us hints and glimpses rather than clear views may we not also suppose as something reasonable and suggested by the analogy of nature that some points that could have been more clearly explained were left obscure merely to encourage our diligence and modestytwo virtues which if it wouldnt seem disrespectful to such great men i would recommend to the minute philosophers lysicles replied this indeed is excellent you expect that men of sense and spirit should in great humility put out their eyes and blindly swallow all the absurdities and nonsense that are offered to them as divine revelation on the contrary i want them to open their eyes look sharply and try the spirit berkeleys phrase to see whether it is of god rather than passively and ignorantly condemning all religions together if they would compare the christian system with other claimants to divine revelation consider impartially the doctrines precepts and events contained in christianity weigh them in the balance against any other religious natural moral or historical accounts and examine diligently all the proofs internal and external that for so many ages have been able to influence and persuade so many wise learned and inquiring men they might find in christianity certain special features that sufficiently distinguish it from all other religions and supposed revelations as a basis for a reasonable faith if that happened i leave it to the minute philosophers to consider whether they are right to take a revelation so distinguished and attested and dismiss it with impatient scorn because some parts of it are obscure he returns to the topic of obscurity in texts written in an ancient foreign language the likelihood that we wont know all the idioms and so on and repeats his plea for judging religious writings in the same manner as nonreligious ones you may lecture and expound but nothing you have said or can say alters the fact that a revelation that doesnt reveal is a mere contradiction in terms tell me alciphron dont you accept that the light of the sun is the most glorious production of providence in this natural world suppose i do well this light that you cant deny was made by god shines only on the surface of things doesnt shine in the night shines imperfectly in the twilight is often interrupted refracted and obscured represents distant things and small things dubiously imperfectly or not at all isnt all this true it is doesnt it follow that to expect in this world a constant uniform light from god without any mixture of shade or mystery would be to depart from the rule and analogy of the creation and that therefore its wrong to argue that the light of revelation is not divine because its not as so clear and full as you expect or because it doesnt shine equally at all times and in all places because i claim to be fair and unbiased in this debate i have to admit that you say some plausible thingsas a man of argument will always be able to do in vindication of his prejudices but i should come into the open and tell you once for all that however much you question and answer illustrate and enlarge you wont convince me that the christian religion is divinely revealed in support of this attitude i have said several things and have many more to say that carry weight not only with myself but with many great men who are good friends of mine and they wont stop carrying weight no matter what euphranor says on the other side i envy you the happiness of knowing such people i cant have that advantage living as i do in this outoftheway place so i have to make the most of this opportunity that you and lysicles have put into my hands i regard you as two able physicians and you were pleased to consider me as a patient whom you have generously undertaken to cure now a patient must be completely free to explain his case and report all his symptoms because concealing a symptom might prevent a perfect cure so please understand me not as objecting to or arguing against either your skill or your medicines but only as reporting on my condition and on the effects your medicines have on me alciphron didnt you give me to understand that you would wipe out my prejudices it is true a good physician eradicates every fibre of the disease come you shall have a patient hearing tell me didnt plato believe that god inspired particular men as organs or trumpets to proclaim and sound forth his oracles to the world and wasnt the same opinion also embraced by other great writers of antiquity socrates seems to have thought that all true poets spoke by inspiration and cicero held that there was no extraordinary genius without it what would you infer from this i would infer that inspiration shouldnt seem impossible or absurd but rather agreeable to the light of reason and the notions of mankind youll agree with this i suppose because you have made it an objection against one particular revelation that there are so many claims to revelation throughout the world alciphron replies with a dig at the word inspire it comes he rightly says from latin meaning to breathe or blow in so it should be applied to mere wind or vapour and not to big truths euphranor sharply takes this up pointing out that alciphron is willing to say that he discourses while sitting down and yet discourse comes from latin meaning run about alciphron defends his use of discourse in the obvious way and euphranor cashes in on that may we not as well conceive that the term inspiration might be borrowed from sensible things to stand for gods action when in an extraordinary manner he influences arouses and enlightens the mind of a prophet or an apostle lets drop the silly point about blowing in and get back to our real topic when we look into our own minds it seems to me we plainly perceive certain instincts impulses and tendencies that from time to time spring up unaccountably in our souls this is ordinary and natural but why cant we conceive it possible for the human mind for an extraordinary reason to be moved in an extraordinary manner having its faculties stirred up and kicked into action by a supernatural power he admits that there have been and will be wild visions and morbid ravings but that doesnt mean that there arent also genuine inspirations we cant rule out the possibility that a true prophet or inspired person can distinguish divine inspiration from mentally unbalanced imagination as easily as we can distinguish sleeping from waking he quotes the book of jeremiah to that effect i see no need to deny that inspirations and revelations are possible make the best you can of this concession well if something is allowed as possible we are entitled to suppose that it is fact we are let us then suppose that god chose to make a revelation to men and that he inspired some men as a means to instruct others having supposed this can you deny that their inspired discourses and revelations might have been committed to writing or that the written versions might in the course of time become obscure in many places that some of them might even have been less clear than others at the outset or that they might get altered by frequent transcribing as other writings are known to have done isnt it even very probable that all these things would happen i grant it well then how can you defend your claim that the bible is not divine because of facts about it that you now acknowledge would probably accompany any divine revelation transmitted down to us through so many centuries he concedes the point about small blemishes that might arise from copying errors etc but i defy the wit of man to invent anything more extravagant than the accounts the bible gives of apparitions devils miracles god manifest in the flesh being born again grace selfdenial resurrection of the dead and suchlike sick dreamsthings so odd unaccountable and remote from human understanding that you have no more chance of clearing them of the charge of absurdity than you have of making a black man white by washing him no critical skill can justify them no tradition can recommend themeven as inventions of competent men let alone as divine revelations i always had a great opinion of your wisdom alciphron but now i consider you as something more than man how otherwise could you know what it may be proper for god to reveal this is of course a sneer i dont think it is insulting to the greatest of human understandings to suppose that they are ignorant of many things that arent suited to their faculties or lie out of their reach even the plans of princes often lie beyond the ken of their subjects who can only know what is revealed to them by those at the helm and are often unqualified to judge concerning the usefulness and likely consequences even of what they are allowed to know until in due course the scheme unfolds and is explained by the course of events of course many things contained in the bible are remote from the common understanding of mankind but i dont see that it follows from this that they didnt come from divine revelation on the contrary doesnt it seem reasonable to suppose that a revelation from god would contain something different in kind or more excellent in degree than anything that lies within the grasp of humans even of the wisest philosopher accounts of separate spirits good or bad prophecies miracles etc are undoubtedly strange but i dont see how you can prove them to be impossible or absurd some things are so evidently absurd that it would be almost as silly to disprove them as to believe them and i take thesethe ones i listed a moment agoto be of that sort isnt it possible that some men show as much prejudice and narrowness in rejecting all such accounts as others might show slackness and credulity in accepting them i cant understand why anyone who admits the union of the soul with the body should declare it impossible for the human nature to be united to the divine in some way that cant be described or grasped by reason nor can i see any absurdity in the idea that sinful man may be born again may become a new creature by the grace of god reclaiming him from a carnal life to a spiritual life of virtue and holiness and since being governed by sense and appetite is contrary to the happiness and perfection of a rational creature i dont in the least wonder that we are told to exercise selfdenial as for the resurrection of the dead i dont regard that as so very contrary to the analogy of nature when i see plants that have been left to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigour or a worm that appears to be dead change its nature so that something that at first crawled on the earth becomes a new species and flies around with wings and when i consider that the soul and body are things of such utterly different kinds i cant see any reason to be positive that the soul must necessarily be extinguished when the body falls to pieces especially since i find in myself a strong natural desire for immortality and i havent observed that natural appetites are given in vain given merely to be frustrated you regard certain things as extravagant and absurd but i shant agree with that until i see good reason for it no alciphron your positive airs mustnt be regarded as proofs and we wont think things are contrary to common sense just because you say so by common sense we ought to mean either the general sense of mankind or the improved reason of thinking men now i believe that all those articles you have so powerfully and vividly summed up and exploded can be shown to be consistent with and even in harmony with common sense in one or other of these senses that the gods might appear and converse among men and that the divinity might inhabit human nature were things that the heathens believed and though the notion of a devil may not be so obvious or so fully described there are plain traces of it in several traditions he cites ancient greeks chaldeans and egyptians and reports that a text as early as homer contains something that cardinal bessarion has identified as an allusion to the fall of satan then many more classical references in connection with the other articles on alciphrons list apparently with grace uppermost though it isnt mentioned by name winding up any man who really thinks has only to look at what other thinking men have thoughtmen who cant be supposed to be prejudiced in favour of revealed religionand hell see cause if not to think with reverence of the christian doctrines of grace selfdenial rebirth sanctification and the rest at least to judge more modestly and cautiously than someone who confidently declares them absurd and in conflict with the reason of mankind lysicles says that none of this has the slightest appeal him and that if this makes anyone think he is ignorant i am happy and safe in my ignorance crito says perhaps not so safe which he and backs up thus mere ignorance isnt a crime but willful ignorance deliberate ignorance ignorance from laziness or conceited ignorance is a faultwe have the testimony of heathen writers as proof of that and it doesnt need proof to show that if ignorance is a fault then we cant be secure in ignorance as an excuse honest crito seems to hint that man should take care to inform himself while alive so that his neglect to do so wont be punished when he is dead the best way to get a gentleman to keep on with something is to try to frighten him out of it this is the stale and absurd tactic that priests use making them and their religion more odious and contemptible to me than all the other items put together that hellandeternalpunishment thing is the most absurd as well as the nastiest thought that ever entered into the head of mortal man but you must admit that it isnt an exclusively christian absurdity because socrates that great freethinker of athens thought it probable that impious men are punished for ever in hell it is reported of this same socrates that he was often known to think for twentyfour hours at a stretch fixed in the same position and wrapped up in meditation our modern freethinkers are men of a more lively sort those old philosophers were most of them insecure i think they had a narrow timid way of thinking that falls far short of the frank spirit of our times but if a man doesnt know the nature of the soul how can reason give him any assurance about whether it is mortal or immortal but what if i do know the nature of the soul i have been taught that whole secret by a modern freethinker a man of science who discovered the nature of the soul not by a tiresome looking into himself or by getting himself confused in a labyrinth of notions or by stupidly thinking for whole days and nights together but by looking into things and observing the analogy of nature this great man is a tried and tested scientist who has conducted many experiments on plants he holds that men and plants are really of the same species that animals are moving plants and plants are fixed animals that the mouths of animals have the same use as the roots of plants that blossoms and flowers correspond to the private parts of the human body that plant and animal bodies are both organic and both have life which is a certain motion and circulation of juices through the appropriate tubes or vessels the soul he says is the specific form or source from which come the distinct qualities or properties of things we start with plants because they are simpler than animals and thus easier to analyse the soul of any plantrosemary for exampleis nothing more or less than its essential oil this is the source of its special fragrance taste and medicinal virtuesie its life and operations use chemical techniques to separate or extract this essential oil and you get the soul of the plant whats left behind being a dead carcass that doesnt have a single property or power of the plant this essential oil is an oily substance with a fine subtle element or volatile salt imprisoned in it strictly speaking this volatile salt is the essence of the plants soul containing all its powers and the oil is the vehicle of this most subtle part of the soul the part that fixes and individuates it and just as the plant dies when separated from this oil so the soul dies when this essential oil is split up into its elements as you can see by leaving it exposed for some time to the open air so that the volatile salt or spirit can fly off after which the oil remains dead and tasteless not perceptibly weighing any less but having lost that volatile essence of the soul that ethereal aura that spark of existence which returns and mixes with the solar light the universal soul of the world and the only source of life im talking about all lifeof plants lower animals and thinking animals which differ only according to the fineness of organization of their bodies this chemical system lets you at once into the nature of the soul and accounts for all its phenomena in the compound that is called man the soul or essential oil is what commonly goes by the name of animal spirit see note on page for chemists do now agree that animal spirits are nothing but the more subtle oils now in proportion as the essential oil of the plant we call man is more subtle than that of other plants the volatile salt that impregnates it is more free to act and that explains the properties and actions of humans that distinguish them from lower creatures he gives some examples o lysicles your ingenious friend has opened up a new scene and explained the most obscure and difficult points in the clearest and easiest manner this account of things struck my fancy i must admit im no great lover of creeds or systems but when a notion is reasonable and based on experience i know how to value it really seriously lysicles do you believe this account to be true in the next exchange the artist and his art mean roughly the expert and the field in which he is an expert really seriously i dont know whether i do or not but i can assure you that the ingenious artist himself hasnt the least doubt about it and believe an artist in his art is a sound bit of advice and a short way to knowledge but what does the soul of man have to do with the chemical art the same reason that tells me to trust a skillful artist in his art inclines me to suspect him when he is out of his art men are too apt to reduce unknown things to the standard of what they know and bring a prejudice or slant from things they have been familiar with in making judgments about things with which they have not been familiar i have known a violinist solemnly teach that the soul is harmony a geometrician very positive that the soul must be extended and a physician who having pickled half a dozen embryos and dissected a few rats and frogs became very sure of himself and affirmed that there is no soul at all lysicles declines to argue saying in effect theres the theory take it or leave it which euphranor ironically describes as said like a gentleman then he asks whether the maxim about believing an artist in his art applies to clergymen lysicles says no why not because he lysicles knows as much about religious matters as the clergy do all men of good sense are competent judges of those matters what are gods attributes and his treatment of mankind the true end and happiness of rational creatures and the means of improving and perfecting their beingsare these more easy and obvious matters than the ones to which ordinary secular studies are devoted perhaps not but i do know thissome things are so obviously absurd that no authority will make me give in to them for instance if all mankind tried to convince me that the son of god was born on earth in a poor family was spat upon beaten and crucified lived like a beggar and died like a thief i wouldnt believe a word of it common sense shows everyone how an earthly prince or ambassador can decently appear and the son of god coming as an ambassador from heaven must make an appearance that is much greater than that and is in all respects the very reverse of that which jesus christ is reportedeven by his own historiansto have made do you think lysicles that if a man entered london in a rich suit of clothes with a hundred gilt coaches and a thousand laced footmen this would be a more divine and truly grand appearance than if he had power with a word to heal all kinds of diseases to raise the dead to life and calm storms at sea oh im sure it is very agreeable to common sense to suppose that he could restore others to life but couldnt save his own you tell us of course that he rose again from the dead but what was the point of his dying in the first placethe just dying for the unjust the son of god dying for wicked men and why precisely there why exactly then why didnt he appear earlier and preach in all parts of the world so that the benefit was spread wider and more evenly account for all these points and reconcile them if you can to the common notions and plain sense of mankind crito replies with two points one is that some of lysicles questions are boorish and illmannered benevolent acts arent usually scrutinized as carefully as other acts who but a minute philosopher would on a gratuitous distribution of favours ask why now rather than earlier lysicles should face the fact that he is out of his depth none of us know nearly enough to be entitled to form judgments on what it would have been reasonable for god to do there are several pages of this you cant judge the parts of a machine without knowing how the whole thing works lysicles says that some things can be seen at first glance to be so cruel and unjust that they are obviously unworthy of god to which crito replies that we should take into account à propos of how badly god treated the egyptians how badly the egyptians had treated the israelites and also repeated that caution in judgment is appropriate when we know that we dont have all the facts euphranor has a qa argument making the point that children often dont understandand may even resentactions by their parents that are entirely for their own good he likens this to lysicles attitude to actions by god the topic of the ancients versus the freethinking moderns comes up again in the course of it alciphron says that the present times gray and hoary with age and experience have a manifest advantage over those that are falsely called ancient the point being that in ancient times the world was younger than it is now he continues i tell you in plain english euphranor we dont want your revelations for this plain reason those that are clear were already known to everyone and noone gets any benefit from those that are obscure just as its impossible for anyone to believe the practical principles of the christian religion and not be the better for them so it is obvious that those principles may be much more easily taught as articles of faith than demonstrated or discovered as doctrines of science here highgrade theoretical knowledge we see all the time that many are instructed in matters of faith few are taught by scientific demonstration and fewer still can discover truth for themselves i wish that minute philosophers would reflect on some facts relating to the natural or civil concerns of the world with religion not coming into it namely how rarely men are swayed or governed by mere reasoning and how often by faith how little they know and how much they believe how uncommon it is to meet with a man who argues soundly who really is a master of reason or walks by that rule how much better qualified men are to judge concerning facts than concerning reasonings to receive truth on testimony than to deduce it from principles how general a spirit of trust or reliance runs through the whole system of life and opinion and at the same time how seldom the dry light of unprejudiced nature is followed or to be found if our thinking men would only give thought to these things they might find it hard to produce a good reason why faith which has so great a share in everything else should have no place in religion re dry light see note on page he then replies to the were already known to everyone part of what alciphron has just said by saying that obviously they werent perhaps they could have been known but revelation is useful if it reveals something that men havent taken the trouble to know even if they could have known it alciphron then moves to a complaint against prophecies namely that they are very obscure euphranor replies that some are obscure while some are not which is pretty much what should be expected given the way the world is and the way men are alciphron in reply refers to the scepticism about prophecies of freethinking experts on these matter and euphranor responds to that somewhat sneeringly and remarks that the christians have their experts too after a further exchange of insults euphranor offers some explanations of why certain prophecies are unclearto us at this time looking back in time we can see a certain progress from darker to lighter in religious matters so we can reasonably expect that future events will clear up such points as at present exercise the faith of believers alciphron now drops prophecies and turns to something else i want now to examine your religion by comparing the system of revelation with collateral accounts of ancient heathen writers and showing how much it clashes with them the christian revelation presupposes the jewish religion so if the jewish one is destroyed the christian one must of course fall to the ground with it i am going to go the short way by attacking this jewish revelation headon tell me if we believe the mosaic account of things ie the first five books of the old testament dont we have to hold that the world was created not quite six thousand years ago yes we do what will you say now if other ancient records carry the history of the world back many thousand years beyond this period what if the egyptians and chinese have accounts extending to thirty or forty thousand years what if the egyptians have observed twelve hundred eclipses during the space of fortyeight thousand years what if the chinese have also many observations antecedent to the jewish account of the creation what if the chaldeans had been observing the stars for more than four hundred thousand years and what shall we say if we have successions of kings and their reigns marked for several thousand years before the beginning of the world assigned by moses shall we reject the accounts and records of all other nationsthe most famous ancient and learned in the worldand preserve a blind reverence for moses the legislator of the jews if they deserve to be rejected euphranor replies why shouldnt we reject them this introduces an attack on the accounts and records that alciphron has mentioned the only reliable ones dont go as far back as moses time for the beginning of the world the writers of the records that stretch further back are unknown or unregarded by ancient astronomers modern scholars have uncovered inconsistencies in the chinese accounts alciphron remarks that the modern scholars in question are mostly roman catholic missionaries and euphranor replies that they are our only source of information about the chinese and that in any case it makes sense to trust them the same persons who tell us of these accounts refute them if we reject their authority in one case what right have we to build upon it in another alciphron praises the chinese generally as a learned able and acute people who are addicted to arts and sciences euphranor replies at length that on the contrary the chinese are superstitious credulous and absurd then he turns to the egyptian records purporting to make the world older than moses did and gets alciphron to admit that he doesnt know where those records were found when they were written how they were preserved and so on they arent mentioned by any ancient greek writers though some of them visited egypt euphranor comments again at even greater length on the credulity of any modern person like alciphron who believes such stuff alciphron replies with a challenge how can you account for the work that the great joseph scaliger and sir john marsham have put in on those records euphranor declines to account for it and deplores the fact that such substantial scholars as scaliger and marsham should waste time on that rubbishy stuff after all its hard to see why those egyptian priests should have set up spurious records supporting such great claims to antiquityrecords that differ one from another but are alike in one thing namely that they overthrow moses history how can this be accounted for if there was no real foundation for the records what pleasure profit or power could motivate men to forge successions of ancient names and periods of time for ages before the world began really alciphron is there anything so strange or unprecedented in this empty wish to extend the antiquity of nations beyond the truth hasnt it been seen in most parts of the world doesnt it appear even in our own times especially among dependent and subdued people who have little else to boast of he then launches into masses of detail first about the irish and then about the sicilians these being dependent and subdued people who invented long histories for themselves as a way of feeling important then why isnt it likely that the egyptians a subdued people invented fabulous accounts from the same motive and like others valued themselves because of extravagant claims to antiquity when in all other respects they were so much inferior to their masters and it is no less certain that the phœnicians assyrians and chaldeans were each a conquered and reduced people before the rest of the world appear to have heard anything of their claims to such remote antiquity but what need is there to work at accounting for the motivations of fabulous writers isnt it sufficient to see that they relate absurdities arent supported by any independent evidence seem not to have been believed even by their own countrymen and are inconsistent one with another theres nothing strange in the fact that men should have the stupidity to create false accounts so as to deceive the world what is strange is the fact that after so many learned critics have done so much towards undeceiving the world there should still be men who are capable of being taken in by the paltry scraps of fabulous or counterfeit writers let me point out that those learned critics may prove to be clergymen perhaps some of them roman catholics what about sir isaac newton was he either catholic or clergyman you may not grant that he was as wise and intellectually powerful as the great men of the minute philosophy but it you cant deny that he had read and thought a great deal on this subject ending his inquiry with a perfect contempt for all those celebrated rivals to moses it has been observed by able men that sir isaac newton though a layman was deeply prejudicedas we can from his great regard for the bible and the same holds for mr locke mr boyle lord bacon and other famous laymen who however knowledgeable on some matters cant be thought to have achieved the keen discernment that is the special distinction of your sect but perhaps there are reasons other than prejudice to incline a man to give moses the preference the government manners and religion of his country were based on the truth of his history there are clear traces of that history in the most ancient books and traditions of the gentiles particularly of the brahmins and parsees his account of the great flood is confirmed by signs in nature as well as by writings of antiquity his history is confirmed by the relatively recent invention of arts and sciences the gradual peopling of the world the very names of ancient nations and even by the authority and arguments of that renowned philosopher lucretius who is so much admired and followed by the freethinkers when he writes on other subjects the continual decrease of fluids the sinking of hills and the slowing of planetary motion provide natural evidence that this world had a beginning just as the civil or historical proofs that i have mentioned plainly indicate that this beginning occurred at about the time assigned to it in the bible and after all that let me add one more remark people digging into the earth have found quantities of shells and in some places bones and horns of animals complete and unbroken that have probably lain there for thousands of years that makes it seem probable that gems medals and metal or stone implements might have remained buried complete and unbroken for forty or fifty thousand years if the world had been that old so how does it come about that no such remains are found no remnants of all those centuries preceding the biblical account of time no fragments of buildings no public monuments no intaglios cameos statues reliefs medals inscriptions utensils or manufactured things of any kind are ever discovered to testify to the existence of those mighty empires those successions of monarchs heroes and demigods for so many thousand years let us look forward in time and think about a time twenty thousand years into the future with the intervening time having involved plagues famines wars and earthquakes all of which will have made great havoc in the world isnt it highly probable that pillars vases and statues that now exist would still exist at that future time and testify to our time and all the time between now and then im thinking of pillars etc made of granite porphyry or jasperstones that are so hard that we know them to have lasted for two thousand years above ground without any considerable alteration isnt it also probable that some of our current coins might be dug up at that time far in the future or that old walls and the foundations of buildings might show themselves just as the shells and stones of the primeval world are preserved down to our times these are matters that anyone can form a judgment about using common sense and ordinary experience they give us good reason to conclude that the world was created at about the time recorded in the bible alciphron sat musing and made no answer whereupon lysicles spoke up harking back to critos remark that lucretius supported the mosaic dating of the start of the world i must admit that i would rather suppose with lucretius that the world was made by chance and that men grew out of the earth like pumpkins than pin my faith on those wretched fablespinning fragments of oriental history that alciphron had used as evidence against moses dating of the start of that world as for the learned men who have taken pains to clarify them and piece them together they strike me as being no better than so many musty pedants an able freethinker may now and then make some use of their laborious output and play off one absurdity against anothereg an egyptian absurdity against a jewish one but dont infer from this that he has any real respect for the authority of such apocryphal writers or believes one syllable of the chinese babylonian or egyptian traditions if we seem to give them preference over the bible thats only because they are not established by law this is my plain sense of the matter and i dare say its the general sense of our sect they are too rational to take such trifles seriously though they sometimes give hints of deep learning and put on a grave face just to have fun at the expense of bigots since lysicles will have it so i am content not to build on accounts of time preceding the mosaic he then talks about historians of about moses own time they should be regarded as on a par with moses he says and some of them give accounts that utterly clash with hiseg one that says that the jews were really egyptians who had leprosy and were driven out of the country for that reason on this account the religion that they said had been given to them on mount sinai was really something which they as egyptians brought with them from egypt crito replies that those other accounts arent evidence against the mosaic one because they are in such conflict with one another and that linguistic considerations show that the jews werent egyptians and that a religion whose fundamental principle was monotheism and whose principal design was to abolish idolatry couldnt have come from egypt the most idolatrous of all nations after some more of this alciphron deplores the loss of the books of those great men celsus porphyry and julian books that would have enabled the modern freethinkers to demolish the whole jewish religious system at once crito questions that and says some slighting things about each of the three especially emphasizing how credulous they were accepting all sorts of weird beliefs they were he concludes whimsical superstitious weak and visionaryand he throws in a final gibe against the impartial gentlemen who admire the talents and are proud to tread in the footsteps of those three men see things in different lights something that one person wonders at is regarded as negligible by another it can even happen that a prejudiced mind whose attention is turned towards things faults and blemishes fancies it sees some shadow of defect in the great lights that have in our own days enlightened the world but tell me crito what you think of the jewish historian josephus he is agreed to have been a man of learning and judgment he did himself accept a revealed religion namely judaism and christians commonly cite him with respect when his authority suits their purposes all this i accept then mustnt it seem suspicious to any impartial inquirer that this learned jew should write the history of his own country focusing on the very place and time of jesus christs appearance without saying anything about the character miracles and doctrine of that extraordinary person some ancient christians were so sensitive about this that they tried to repair the situation by inserting a famous passage in the work of that historiana forgery that has been sufficiently detected by able modern critics well there is expert opinion on both sides of that question but i dont want to get into all that so i am content to take it your way by supposing that the passage is not genuine but is the pious fraud of some wrongheaded christian who couldnt tolerate the omission in josephus but that fraud cant make the omission a real objection against christianity and i cant see in the omission any other basis for amazement or suspicion supposing the gospel account to have exactly true it would seem very natural for josephus not to have reported it given that he was aiming by his work to give his country some standing in the eyes of the world which had been greatly prejudiced against the jews and knew little of their historya purpose that the life and death of our saviour wouldnt have contributed to even slightly josephus couldnt have been an eyewitness of our saviour or his miracles he was a highclass pharisee who was learned in foreign as well as jewish scholarship with a high position in the state whereas the gospel was preached to the poor the gospel was initially accepted and then spread by poor illiterate people chosen for this role so that the gospels spread wouldnt seem to be the work of man or a product of human selfinterest or power the jews generally expected the messiah to be a worldly and conquering princea prejudice that was so strong that they preferred attributing our saviours miracles to the devil to acknowledging him to be the messiah at josephuss time the jewish state was in a condition of hellish disorder and confusion with mens minds filled and stunned by unparalleled wars dissensions massacres and seditions of that devoted people taking all these facts together i dont find it strange that such a man who was writing with that view at that time and in those circumstances should omit to describe our blessed saviours life and death or to mention his miracles or to pay any attention to the state of the christian church which at that time was like a tiny seed just beginning to take root and germinate and this will seem even less strange if you bear in mind that the apostles in a few years after our saviours death left jerusalem set about convert nonjews and were dispersed throughout the world the converts in jerusalem were not only some of the poorest people but were also few in number the three thousand converts added to the church in one day when peter preached in jerusalem seem to have been strangers from all over the country who had gathered there to celebrate the feast of pentecost throughout the time of josephus and for several years more during a succession of fifteen bishops the christians at jerusalem conformed to the laws of moses which made them in outward appearance just like the rest of the jews which must have made them harder to notice the gospel when first propagated seemed to ignore the great or considerable men of this world would it be surprising if they in turn overlooked it as something not suited to their way of thinking he goes on to say that learned jews at that time might well be afraid in one way of writing in favour of christianity and in another way of writing against it so that their safest course was to say nothing about it also the historian gamaliel does mention jesus christ in passing in his account of st jamess death although he shows a respect for the apostle he mentions jesus in a casual and neutral way saying nothing either good or bad about him but he characterizes him as jesus who was called the christ not who claimed to be the christ or who was falsely called the christ but simply and then he says it again this time in greek he continues it is evident that josephus knew there was such a man as jesus and that he was said to be the christ and yet he condemns neither him nor his followers which i see as evidence in their favour if josephus had known or been convinced that jesus was an impostor of course he would have said so plainly i cant understand why any man should conclude against the truth of the gospel from josephuss omitting to speak of it any more than from his omitting to accept it if the first christians been chief priests and rulers or men of science and learning it might have been more plausible to contend that their religion was a human construct than it is in fact given that it has pleased god to use weak things to confound the strong yet it seems an odd argument in support of any doctrine that it was preached by simple people to simple people it would indeed be a very weak argument if the only testimony to the doctrine came from simple people but what we have here is a doctrine of which this is true its first instruments were people with very few human advantages it made its first progress among people who didnt have wealth skills or power to grace or encourage it in a short time through its own innate excellence and the mighty force of miracles and the demonstration of the holy spirit it spread throughout the world and subdued men of all ranks and conditions of life doing this not only with no support from all worldly motives but positively against such motives isnt it very unreasonable to reject or suspect such a doctrine on the grounds that its human means are lowly mightnt this with much better reason be thought to be evidence that the doctrine comes from god alciphron replies that real inquirers will demand testimony from learned men there has been plenty of that but their testimony is suspect because they were prejudiced christians and therefore their testimony is to be suspected you are demanding evidence of the truth of christianity from people who didnt believe it this isnt reasonable they kick this topic around for a while and then a dispute starts up concerning how much respect the early church fathers deserve alciphron says that even if he did give weight to early christian writings the great number of forgeries and heresies that sprung up in those times would considerably take away from that weight let us suppose something that you do agree to be possible namely that there is a god a devil and a revelation from heaven that was committed to writing many centuries ago on the basis of that supposition take a look at human nature and ask what would probably follow if the supposition were fact isnt it very likely there would be halfbelievers mistaken bigots holy frauds men who were ambitious selfinterested disputing conceited schismatic heretical absurd among those who announced themselves as believers in this revealed religion and isnt it also very likely that after a few centuries there would be various readings omissions transpositions and obscurities in the text of the sacred oracles you be the judge is it reasonable to treat as an objection to something a course of events that would probably and naturally follow if the thing in question did exist well say what you will this variety of opinions must shake the faith of a reasonable man where there are so many different opinions on the same point its very certain that they cant all be true but its certain that they can all be false and the means we have to use to find out the truth when a man of sense embarks on this inquiry he finds himself suddenly startled and thrown offbalance by hard words and knotty questions this makes him abandon the pursuit thinking the game not worth the chase crito replies that differences of opinion and the formation of sects occurs in all branches of human studyhe cites law medicine and politicsand this doesnt deter us from thinking that there are good rules sound ideas and useful truths in all those disciplines he develops this approach in connection with medicine remarking that real discoveries have been made despite the hard words and knotty questions that have arisen on the way to them then after a brief exchange of insults crito turns to the question of schisms and subsects but to return what profession of men is there who never split into schisms and never talk nonsense isnt it obvious that out of all the kinds of knowledge on which the human mind is employed there grow certain excrescences that can safely be pared off as we pare our fingernails under all that rubbishy stuff it is certain that the faith derived from christ and his apostles was not a piece of empty sophistry and to claim to demolish the foundation of faith for the sake of the superstructure that humans have built is a sign of poor thinking and its a sign of unfairness to suppose that a doubtful sense is fixed and argue from one side of the question in disputed points such questions as should the beginning of genesis be understood in a literal or an allegorical sense is the book of job a history or a parable are disputed amongst christians so an unbeliever has no right to argue from one side of any of them what we are arguing for now is not this or that tenet of a sect this or that controversial idea but rather the general faith taught by christ and his apostles and preserved by universal and perpetual tradition in all the churches down to our own times to attack this divine doctrine on account of things that come not from within the doctrine but from external sources such as the theories and disputes of men strikes me as an absurdity comparable with cutting down a fine tree that provides fruit and shade because its leaves give nourishment to caterpillars or because spiders sometimes weave cobwebs among the branches after an exchange focussing on the question of how clever men ought to spend their time but after all the examination and inquiry that mortal man can make about revealed religion it is impossible to reach any rational sure footing we are told strange things that are said to be proved by the fact that men have laid down their lives for them but it is perfectly conceivableindeed it has often happenedthat men have died for the sake of false beliefs that they used to hold you may indeed find examples of men dying for falsehoods that they believed but can you find a case of a mans dying for the sake of a proposition that he didnt believe of course not it is inconceivable yet this must be what happened if the witnesses of christs miracles and resurrection were impostors there is indeed a great deal of glittery talk about faith based on miracles but when i examine this matter thoroughly and track the christian faith back to its origins i find that it is really based on darkness and hesitation and uncertainty instead of propositions that are evident or at least agreeable to human reason i find an astonishing narrative of the son of god tempted in the wilderness by the devilsomething utterly unexplainable having absolutely no purpose or use or reason i meet with strange stories of angels appearing voices from heaven demonsthings quite out of line with common sense and common experiencealong with a number of incredible feats said to have been done by divine power but more probably the inventions of men and not made less likely to be so by my complete inability to guess why they were invented deeply laid plans are dark and the less we know the more we suspect but even if all those stories are true i shant accept that they were miraculous until i have a thorough knowledge of ordinary natural causes and of the force of magic it seems to me alciphron that what you are analysing is not faith but infidelity lack of faith and that you are tracing it back to its sources which judging from your own account i understand to be dark and doubtful worries and surmises hastiness in judging and narrowness in thinking and all this is based on your fantastic overrating of your own scrap of experience and on real ignorance of the views of god and of the qualities operations and interrelations of the many fundamentally different kinds of beings that exist in the universe or that you dont know dont exist thats what the sources of unbelief are likeobscure uncertain fanciful and conjectural whereas the sources of faith are propositions that seem to me plain and clear there is nothing unclear about these this faith in christ was spread throughout the world soon after his death that wasnt brought about by human learning politics or power in the churchs early years many knowledgeable and honest men accepted this faith not from some but against all worldly motives the nearer those men were to the fountainhead of christianity the better chance they had to check on the truth of the propositions that they believed the less it was in their selfinterest to be persuaded the more need there was for evidence to convince them they relied on the authority of people who declared themselves eyewitnesses of the miracles and resurrection of christ those professed eyewitnesses suffered greatly through giving this testimony and finally they sealed it with their blood those witnesses weak and unimportant as they were overcame the worldspread more light preached purer morals and did more benefit to mankind than all the philosophers and wise men put together if these propositions are clear and sure as they seem to me to be they constitute plain just and reasonable grounds for assent to the christian faith they dont rest on any falsehoods they dont contain anything beyond our sphere because they dont presuppose more knowledge than we have or better faculties than we are actually equipped with and even if they arent accepted as morally certain as i think they will be by fair and unprejudiced inquirers even accepting them as only probable is sufficient to stop the mouth of an unbeliever morally certain means certain enough for all practical purposes its a bit vague but is stronger than only probable the pillars of our faith are the above eight plain propositions and not the obscure ones that you supposed which are in fact the unsound uncertain sources of unbelief in a rash prejudiced and assuming mind to argue or counterargue on the basis that a supposed miracle might be explained by hidden powers of nature or by magic is groping in the dark but by the evident light of their senses men can be sure enough about perceptible effects and matters of fact such as the miracles and the resurrection of christ and the testimony of such men can be passed on through centuries with the same moral certainty as can other historical narrations and those same miraculous facts when reason has related them to the doctrines they were brought to prove provide an unbiased mind with strong indications that they have come from god or from a superior source as for the fact that jews and gentiles back then attributed our saviours miracles to magicdo you count that as evidence against the miracles it seems to be to be positive evidence that those events did occur it doesnt square with the christian account of what caused them but it doesnt bring any evidence against that account as for the nature and operations of demons the history laws and system of rational beings and gods schemes or viewswe dont claim to know enough about all this to account for every action and appearance recorded in the gospel but you dont know enough of those things to be entitled to object against accounts that are so well supported by testimony its easy to raise doubts regarding many authentic parts of civil historyevents that we find inexplicable because the explanation of them requires more knowledge than we have of facts circumstances and councils and its even easier with respect to natural history in that field if surmises were accepted as evidence against things that are odd strange and inexplicable if our slight experience were made the rule and measure of truth and no phenomenon was accepted unless we with our ignorance of the principles laws and system of nature could explain it we would make discoveries all rightdiscoveries about our own blindness and presumption something that i cant begin to explain by any rules of logic and good sense is why men who are so easily and so often floored by problems about the natural visible world should yet be so sharpsighted and dogmatic about the invisible world and its mysteries i expect that ill always be in the darkas you put itabout the evidence for the christian religion and always presume there isnt any for how is it possible at this remote distance in time to arrive at any knowledge or conduct any demonstrations about it what of it i admit that knowledge in a strict sense cant be had except of something that is either selfevident or demonstrated but probable arguments are a sufficient basis for faith who ever thought that rigorous proofs are necessary to make a christian all that is needed is faith and provided that men are convinced in the main and on the whole this saving faith can be consistent with some degrees of obscurity doubt and error for although the light of truth is unchangeable in its eternal source the father of lights in relation to us it is variously weakened and obscured by passing across a long distance or through a thick medium in which it is intercepted distorted or tinted by mens prejudices and passions but despite all this if you will use your eyes you can see enough for the purposes either of nature or of grace although the light you see by is dimmer or brighter depending on the place the distance the time of day and the medium and although there may be much that we cant explain in the realms of nature and of grace all that is required for faith to be maintained is that the two should exhibit enough analogy to make it probable that they have the same author are the workmanship of one and the same hand those who saw touched and handled jesus christ after his resurrection if anyone did may be said to have seen by a clear light but to us the light is very dim and yet we are expected to believe in the resurrection just as they did for my part i agree with spinoza that christs death was literal but his resurrection was allegorical and for my part i cant see anything in this celebrated unbeliever that should make me desert matters of fact and moral evidence so as to adopt his ideas throughout this paragraph evidence means evidentness in this usage the evidence of proposition p refers to how evident p is its not about evidence for p so matters of fact and moral evidence means matters of fact and propositions that are morally evident re morally see the note on page i do have to allow a certain allegorical resurrection i mean the resurrection of christs disciples from weakness to resolution from fear to courage from despair to hope and that allegorical resurrection is evidence for the real one because i cant see how those changes in the disciples can be explained except by supposing that they knew through their own senses that our lord had truly really literally risen from the dead it cant be denied that his disciples who were eyewitnesses of his miracles and resurrection had stronger evidence than we can have of those matters but it also cant be denied that at that time there was a correspondingly greater need for evidence to induce men to embrace a new institution that was contrary to the whole system of their upbringing their prejudices their passions their interests and every human motive still it seems to me that the moral evidence and probable arguments that are within our reach are quite enough to make prudent thinking men keep to the faith that has been handed down to us from our ancestors and established by the laws of our countrya faith requiring submission on matters that are above our knowledge and for the rest recommending doctrines that best fit our interests and our reason he goes on to talk about the advantage that we have of being able to look back at the history of the world during the christian period and seeing gods plans a work in it then we can behold christ crucified that stumblingblock to the jews and foolishness to the greeks putting an end to the temple worship of the one and the idolatry of the other but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness corinthians if a due reflection on these things isnt enough to create a reverence for the christian faith in the minds of men why would that be because men have a wise and cautious incredulity anything but that consider how easily men have faith during their daily doings where there is no prejudice or appetite to bias or disturb their natural judgment the men who in matters of religion wont move an inch unless things are made evident to them and at every turn expect demonstration trust their health to a physician and their lives to a sailor with complete faith i cant think they deserve the honour of being thought harder to convince than other men or that they are more accustomed to know and therefore less inclined to believe on the contrary its tempting to suspect that our modern unbelief owes more to ignorance than to knowledge this leads to squabbles with lysicles about attitudes to careful scholarship and then about the legitimacy of attacking christianity by jokes and puns and innuendo euphranor joins in on that last topic and so finally does although i am a declared admirer of reason a worshipper of reason i have to admit that in some cases the sharpness of ridicule can do more than the strength of argument but if freethinkers sometimes use mirth and humour its not because we have no other weapons it shall never be said that a freethinker was afraid of reasoning no crito we have reasons in store the best are yet to come and if we can find an hour for another conversation before lysicles and i set out for london tomorrow morning ill undertake to supply you with reasons that are as clear effective and close to the point as you could wish seventh dialogue tuesday we assembled at break of day in the library alciphron began with a declaration of his sincerity assuring us he had very maturely and with a most unbiased mind considered everything that had been said the day before he added that a number of probable reasons had been given for accepting the christian faith but he said because those reasons are only probable they cant overcome absolute certainty and demonstration so if i can demonstrate rigorously prove that your religion is absurd and inconsistent your probable arguments in defence of it instantly lose their force and with it all right to be answered or considered when sincere and able witnesses give the same testimony that certainly has great weight in human affairs it can even have enough weight to claim our acceptance of things that are odd and out of line with human judgment and or experience i will also concede that it is possible for a traditionie a chain of testimoniesto be conveyed with moral evidence see note on page through many centuries but you must concede that something thats demonstrably and obviously false shouldnt be accepted on the strength of any testimony whatever because however good testimony is it cant amount to demonstration to be plain no testimony can turn nonsense into sense no moral evidence can make contradictions consistent well then because the strength of our cause doesnt depend on critical points of history chronology or languages it cant be decided by any such points dont be surprised if the same kind of tradition that governs our assent with respect to facts in civil or natural history is not accepted as sufficient support for metaphysical absurdities and absolute impossibilities things that are obscure and unaccountable in human affairs or the operations of nature may nevertheless be possible and if the testimony to them is good enough they may be assented to but religious assent or faith can be plainly shown to be intrinsically impracticable impossible and absurd this is the primary reason for unbelief this is our citadel and fortress it may indeed be ornamented with extra turrets and supplementary walls of learnedness of various sorts but if those are demolished the fortress still stands its own strength makes it impregnable well i have to admit that this shrinks our field of inquiry considerably if you make good on what you have just said ill have nothing more to say it is easy to fool the shallow mind of the vulgar because it attends only to the surfaces of things and thinks about them not in detail but en bloc and so we find a blind reverence for religious faith and mystery but when a sharp philosopher comes to dissect and analyse these items of faith the deceit plainly appears and because he isnt blind he has no reverence for empty notionsor more accurately for mere forms of speech that mean nothing and are of no use to mankind the long speech that follows involves a theory of meaning and understanding that was widely accepted at the time its principal source is the third book of lockes essay concerning human understanding words are signs they stand for ideas or they ought to and so far as they suggest ideas they are significant words that dont suggest any ideas are insignificant someone who associates a clear idea with each word that he uses speaks sense and when such ideas are lacking the speaker utters nonsense so if we want to know whether someones speech is senseless and insignificant all we need do is to set aside the words and consider the ideas suggested by them because men cant immediately communicate their ideas to one another they have to use sensible signs or words the purpose of which is to raise in the hearers mind the ideas that are already are in the speakers and if they fail to do this they are useless for someone to count as understanding what he reads or hears he must have a sequence of ideas raised in his mind corresponding to the sequence of words that he has read or heard these are plain truths that men readily assent to in theory but they arent much attended to in practice so they deserve to be expounded in detail and drummed into people however obvious and undeniable they may be people in general dont much like thinking but they dont mind speaking and listening to the speech of others and the effect of that is that their minds are stored with names rather than ideas the husk of knowledge rather than knowledge itself and yet these words without meaning are often what mark off one party or sect or group of partisans from another forming the subject matter of their disputes and the object of their zeal this is the most general cause of error and it isnt restricted to ordinary minds even people who are regarded as acute and learned philosophers are often busy working at names instead of things or ideas and are thought to be expressing knowledge when really they are only uttering hard words without a meaning knowledge is the perception of the connection or disagreement between ideas and someone who doesnt distinctly perceive the ideas associated with the terms cant form a mental proposition corresponding to the verbal one so obviously that person cant possibly have knowledge he cant even be said to have opinion or faith these imply a weaker assent than knowledge does but it still has to be assent to a proposition and although the agreement or disagreement of the ideas wont be as evident as in the case of knowledge the terms of the verbal proposition have to be understood just as clearly as they are in knowledge which means that the conventionally associated ideas must be clearly in the persons mind ill say it again all degrees of assentwhether based on reason or authority and wherever they are on the spectrum from i am compelled to believe this at one end to i am faintly more inclined to accept this than to deny it at the otherare internal acts of the mind that are directed at ideas without which there really cant be any such thing as knowledge faith or opinion we can perhaps raise a dust by arguing with one another about purely verbal propositions but that is mere trifling all this will be readily agreed to with respect to human learning and science here abstract theoretically organised and deductively interlocked bodies of knowledge because in that domain it is a generally accepted method of exposing any doctrine or thesis to strip off its words and examine what ideasif anyare underneath this is often found to be the shortest way to end disputes which might otherwise grow and multiply without end with the disputants not understanding one another or themselves i neednt give examples this doctrine about meaning and understanding shines by its own light and is accepted by all thinking men what i shall do is to apply the doctrine to our present topic i hope i dont need to argue that the rules of reason and good sense that hold sway in all other subjects ought to be applied in religion also well there are those who consider faith and reason to be two distinct domains and want us to think that good sense has nothing to do with the domain of faithwhich is in fact the region where it has most to do i have decided never to argue with such men but leave them peacefully in possession of their prejudices in applying what i have said about ideas and understanding to issues in religion i shant single out any nitpicking disputes in academic theology nor shall i pick on any doctrines concerning the nature and essence of god because you might counter what i said about any of those by claiming that god is infinite and that the problem i had raised was part of our general difficulty in grasping the nature of infinity the central item in the christian dispensation is grace nothing is mentioned or considered more often than grace is throughout the new testament which represents it as something of a very special kind distinct from anything revealed to the jews or known by the light of nature this same grace is spoken of as the gift of god as coming through jesus christ as reigning as abounding as operating men are said to speak through grace and to believe through grace mention is made of the glory of grace the riches of grace the stewards of grace christians are said to be heirs of grace to receive grace grow in grace be strong in grace to stand in grace and to fall from grace and lastly grace is said to justify and to save them hence christianity is styled the covenant or dispensation of grace meaning that christianity rests on promises that god has made through grace and favours that he has given through grace and its well known that no point has created more controversy in the church than this doctrine of grace there have been many disputes about the nature extent and effects of grace and about the kinds of graceuniversal efficacious sufficient preventing and irresistible that have employed the pens of protestant as well as roman catholic theologians and he reels off the names of several christian sects im not even slightly interested in just what these disputes have been so i shant try to list them now all i need to make my point is that great contests on these points have existed and still continue what i would like to be told is the answer to this what is the clear and distinct idea associated with the word grace presumably one can know the bare meaning of a term without going into the depth of all those learned inquiries and controversies this is surely an easy matter provided there is an idea connected to the term and if there isnt it cant be a subject of a rational dispute or an object of real faith of course men may indeed deceive themselves or others by claiming to argue and believe when basically there is no argument or belief that goes beyond mere verbal trifling i can easily understand grace in one of its everyday nonreligious senses grace meaning beauty a blushing womanly grace and grace meaning favour the signs of grace that the queen showed to raleigh but when grace names an active vital ruling principle roughly source of energy or activity see b in euphranors speech on pages influencing and operating on the mind of man and distinct from every natural power or motive i declare that i cant understand it or form any distinct idea of it and therefore i cant assent to any proposition about it and so i cant have any faith regarding it and its a selfevident truth that god doesnt require anyone to do what he cant do when alciphron talks of a word as signifying a distinct idea he may mean that the idea is intrinsically clear or that the idea is distinct from all ideas associated with other words or both in this version distinct will be allowed to stand unexplained a philosophical friend of mine asked me to look at the writings of some theologians that he showed me which i did and i also talked with others on this subject but after all my reading and conversations i could make nothing of it whenever i set aside the word grace and looked into my own mind i found a complete absence of ideas and because i suspect that mens minds and abilities are much alike i suspect that other men if they examined what they call grace with the same exactness and lack of bias would agree with me that there was nothing to it but an empty name this isnt the only example of a meaningless word that is often heard and spoken but is believed to be intelligible simply because it is familiar there are many others that occur in sentences that are said to express necessary articles of faith the fraud that grace imposes on mankind is i think partly the following men speak of this holy principle as of something that acts moves and makes things happen taking their ideas from physical thingsfrom motion and the force or momentum of bodies because bodies are obvious and perceptible men put them in place of grace a spiritual and incomprehensible thing that is clearly a delusion even if our idea of bodily force is ever so clear and intelligible it doesnt follow that the idea of grace a supposed force but one that has nothing bodily about it must be clear and intelligible too and though we can reason clearly perceive assent and form opinions about bodily force it doesnt at all follow that we can do the same regarding grace and so it comes about that a clear sensebased idea of something real producesor rather is made a pretence foran imaginary spiritual faith that isnt actually about anything i call the faith imaginary because it isnt possible for it to be real where there are no ideas there cant be any assent and where there is no assent there cant be any faith and if something is impossible no man can be obliged to have it or do itthats as clear as anything in euclid whatever it is that words are used for i cant believe that they are used to do impossible things so let us look into what they are used for and see if we can make sense of our daily practice words it is agreed are signs so it might be as well to examine the use of other signs so as to understand the use of words counters at a cardtable are used not for their own sake but only as signs substituted for money as words are substituted for ideas tell me alciphron is it necessary every time these counters are used throughout the game to form an idea of the precise amount of money that each represents by no means all thats needed is that the players agree on their respective values at the outset and cash them in at those values when the game is over and in adding up some numbers where the figures stand for pounds shillings and pence do you think its necessary to form ideas of pounds shillings and pence at each step in the operation i dont all that is required is for the figures on the bottom line to direct our actions appropriately with respect to things it seems to follow from this that words can be significant even if they dont every time they are used arouse in our minds the ideas that they signify because its enough for meaningfulness if we have it in our power to substitute things or ideas for the words when there is a call for it it seems to follow also that words have a use additional to that of marking and suggesting distinct ideas namely influencing our behaviour and there are two ways for them to do thatforming rules for us to act by and arousing certain passions dispositions and emotions in our minds so it seems that a discourse that tells us how to act or spurs the doing or notdoing of an action can be useful and significant even if the words making it up dont each bring a distinct idea into our minds it seems so tell me alciphron isnt an idea altogether inactive it is so an agentsomething that does things an active mind or spiritcant be an idea and cant be like an idea from which it would seem to follow that the words that stand for an active principle soul or spirit dont stand for ideas in the strict and proper sense of ideas but they arent insignificant or meaningless as i can show through one really striking example namely the word i or the word myself as used by me i understand what it signifies i know what it means but what it signifies isnt an idea and isnt like an idearather it is something that thinks and wills and grasps ideas and does things with them it cant be denied that we know what is meant by the terms myself will memory love hate and so forthwe have some notion that we understand relating to themeven though strictly speaking these words dont suggest distinct ideas to us in this version of the seventh dialogue the uses of idea and notion will exactly track berkeleys what would you infer from this what i have inferred already namely that words can be significant without standing for ideas its because people thought otherwise that the doctrine of abstract ideas has arisen do you deny that the mind can abstract i dont deny that it can abstract in a certain sense of that word we can think about one thing separately from another if but only if they could exist separately and could be perceived separately so we can abstract by thinking about a mans head and not about his body or think about colour without thinking about motion or think about shape without thinking about weight but it doesnt follow from this that the mind can frame abstract general ideaseg thinking about colour without thinking about any specific huewhich appear to be impossible yet it is generally thought these days that every noun replacing substantive name here and throughout marks out and exhibits to the mind one distinct idea separate from all others tell me alciphron isnt the word number a noun it is well now see if you can form an idea of number in abstractnot bringing verbal signs or things that are numbered speaking for myself i cant can it be so difficult to form a simple idea of number which is the subjectmatter of a most evident demonstrable science wait a bit let me see if i cant abstract the idea of number from numberwords and numerals and from all particular countable things long pause to tell the truth i dont find that i can apparently then neither you nor i can form distinct simple ideas of number and yet we can make a very proper and significant use of numberwords and numerals they direct us in the management of our affairs and do it in such an essential way that we would be lost without them and yet if other mens abilities are like mine achieving a precise simple abstract idea of number is as difficult as is comprehending any mystery in religion to come now to your example let us examine what idea we can form of force abstracted from body motion and outward perceptible effects speaking again for myself i dont find that i have or can have any such idea surely everyone knows what is meant by force and yet i question whether everyone can form a distinct idea of force i beg you alciphron dont be distracted by words set aside the word force and exclude everything else from your thoughts and then see what precise idea you have of force force is that in bodies which produces motion and other perceptible effects it is then something distinct from those effects it is well then please now set aside any thought of the thing that has the force and the effects that follow from it and contemplate force itself through its own precise idea i have to say that i find it difficult shut your eyes to assist your meditation alciphron closed his eyes and thought for a few minutes and then declared that he couldnt do it well then replied euphranor there is something that it seems neither you nor i can form an idea of and your own remark that mens minds and abilities are much alike implies that noone else has any more of an idea of it than we do it does and yet there are certainly many speculations reasonings and disputes refined subtleties and intricate distinctions relating to this same force and to explain its nature and mark out the different notions of it or kinds of it learned men have used the terms gravity reaction inertial force inherent force immediate force dead force live force momentum solicitatio conatus and various other such expressions and big controversies have arisen about the notions or definitions of these terms men had wanted to know whether force is spiritual or bodily whether it remains after action how it is transferred from one body to another strange paradoxes have been concocted about its nature properties and proportions for instance that opposite forces can exist at the same time in the same quiescent body that the force of percussion in a small particle is infinite he names a book in which details can be found and goes on at some length about controversies between leibniz and others over forces in physics then the ingenious toricelli says concerning the momentum and the velocity of heavy falling bodies that they are a certain something and an idontknowwhat what does all this tell us about the idea of forcejust force itself setting aside body time space motion and all the perceptible measures of force cant we say that its as difficult to form an idea of force as to form an idea of grace i dont know what to think about that but i presume youll agree that some propositions or theorems relating to force are obviously true and also useful for instance what berkeley wrote that a body with conjunct forces describes the diagonal of a parallelogram in the same time that it would the sides with separate what he ought to have meant if a body is subject to two forces represent them by two lines drawn from a single pointdirection representing direction and length representing strength add two more lines to complete a parallelogram the resultant force on the body is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram isnt this theorem very widely useful doesnt the doctrine of the composition and resolution of forces depend on it and through that countless rules and theorems telling us how to act and explaining phenomena all through mechanics and mathematical physics and if this theorem helps men to get the knowledge of many inventions in mechanics and teaches them how to make engines that they can use to do things that are otherwise hard or impossible and provides a key to discovering the nature of planetary motions in addition to all its usefulness here on earth are we going to say that it is not practically or theoretically useful because we have no distinct idea of force obviously not well given that we take that line with force what excuse have we for going a different way with grace if there are queries disputes perplexities and diverging notions and opinions about grace so there are about force also if we cant form any precise distinct idea of grace neither can we of force oughtnt we by parity of reasoning to conclude that there may be various true and useful propositions about grace just as there are about force and oughtnt you also to conclude that grace may for all you know to the contrary be an object of our faith and influence our life and actions by attacking evil habits and supporting good ones even though we cant get a distinct idea of grace all on its own separated or abstracted from god who produces it man who receives it and virtue and piety that result from it shant we allow the same method of arguing the same rules of logic reason and good sense to hold sway in spiritual matters as in physical ones in faith as well as in physics and when we are examining gods revelations shant we use the same candour and make the same allowances as we do when examining the discoveries of men i cant see how a philosopher can be free from bias and prejudice or be said to weigh things in an equal balance if he maintains the doctrine of force and rejects that of grace or admits the abstract idea of triangle while ridiculing the holy trinity anyway however partial or prejudiced other minute philosophers may be you have laid it down as a maxim that the same logic which governs in other matters must be admitted in religion alciphron i think youd do better to stay with the method of wit and humour rather than trying religion by the dry test of reason and logic dont worry by all the rules of right reason it is absolutely impossible that any mysteryespecially the trinityshould really be the object of mans faith im not surprised that you thought so while you held that noone could assent to a verbal proposition without forming in his mind distinct ideas associated with the words in it but you have agreed that those signs can be significant even if they dont suggest ideas represented by them provided they serve to regulate and influence our wills passions or behaviour which commits you to agreeing also that a mans mind can assent to propositions containing such terms when it is directed or affected by them even if it doesnt perceive in itself distinct ideas marked by those terms it seems to follow from this that a man can believe the doctrine of the trinity if he finds it revealed in the bible that the father the son and the holy ghost are god and that there is only one god he can believe this doctrine of a creator redeemer and sanctifier three persons making one substanceeven though he doesnt form in his mind any abstract or distinct ideas of trinity person or substance provided that the doctrine has the right effect on his mind producing in it love hope gratitude and obedience thereby becoming a lively operative principle that influences his life and actions in ways that fit with the notion of saving faith that is required in a christian whether this is right or wrong it seems to follow from what you have declared together with what you have conceded i wonder if there is anything parallel to this christian faith in the minute philosophy suppose a fine gentleman or lady of fashion who are too busy to think for themselves and are only freethinkers at secondhand have the advantage of being initiated quite early into the principles of your sect by listening to men of depth and genius who have often expressed the opinion that the world is governed either by fate or by chance and it doesnt matter which see qa note on page i you wont deny that it is possible for such persons to give their assent to either of these propositions the fate one and the chance one ii and their assent can properly be called faith iii and yet these disciples of the minute philosophy may be unable to dive deep enough to form any abstract or precise or definite idea of fate or of chance iv so that this same gentleman or lady may be said to believe or have faith where they dont have ideas v and this faith or conviction can produce real effects showing itself in the conduct and tone of their lives freeing them from the fears of superstition and giving them a true liking for the world with a noble indifference about any afterlife and cant christians with equal reason be allowed to believe in the divinity of our saviour or believe that in him god and man make one person and be genuinely convinced of this so that this faith or belief becomes a real principle of life and conduct because of this belief that they have they submit to his government believe his doctrine and behave according to his precepts even though they dont form any abstract idea of the union between the divine and human nature and even though they cant clear up the notion of person in a way that will satisfy a minute philosopher it seems obvious to me that we wouldnt so often be faced with a demand for a clear and distinct idea of person in relation to the trinity and wouldnt so often find difficulties about this being treated as objections to our faith if these demands and objections were made only by people who had delicately examined and could themselves explain the principle of individuation in man or could untie the knots and answer the objections that can be raised even about human personal identity alciphron says that he doesnt think there is any great mystery in personal identity and expresses agreement with lockes theory about this that is an opening for euphranor to argue against lockes thesis that as euphranor puts it personal identity consists in consciousness the argument is not worth much as it is based on a stunningly absurdly uncharitable reading of locke it was launched by reid essays on the intellectual powers of man essay chapter anyway this interchange contributes nothing to the rest of the dialogue which euphranor puts back on track thus there is i think a practical kind of faith or assent that shows itself in the will and actions of a man even if his understanding isnt furnished with corresponding abstract precise distinct ideas you indeed have conceded that there are many instances of such practical faith in other matters that dont involve religion so why shouldnt it be that doctrines relating to heavenly mysteries might also be taught in this saving sense to common minds that you may well think incapable of all teaching and faith of the sort you have been demanding this mistaken view of teaching and faith said crito has led to a great deal of profane and misapplied sarcasm but all that can fairly bounced back onto the minute philosophers themselves who muddle scholasticism with christianity and impute to other men the perplexities chimeras and inconsistent ideas that are often the work of their own brains and argue on the basis of their own wrong way of thinking anyone can see that such an ideal abstracted faith is never thought of by the great majority of christiansfarmers for example and artisans and servants and theres nothing in the bible to suggest that either jews or christians are required to engage in the delicately precise forming of abstract ideas nothing like this is to be found in the law or the prophets the evangelists or the apostles everyone whose understanding is not perverted by science falsely so called can see that the saving faith of christians is of quite another kind a vital operative principle roughly source of energy or activity see b in euphranors speech on pages that generates charity and obedience then what can we make of the disputes and decisions of the famous council of nicaea which drew up the socalled nicene creed and all the councils since that one what was the intention of those venerable fathers the homoousians and the homoiousians why did they disturb themselves and the world with hard words and subtle controversies those are greek words meaning respectively the same and similar the controversy was between two views about the relationship of the son to the father whatever their intention was it couldnt have been to do something that is obviously impossiblenamely create precise abstracted ideas of mysteries in the minds of common christians theres no evidence that the majority of christians in those days thought they were obliged to set aside words shut their eyes and form abstract ideas any more than men now form abstract ideas of force time number or many other things about which they nevertheless believe know argue and dispute it seems to me that whatever was the source of that controversy and however it was conducted what it was really about was not a desire by either side to convey precise positive ideas to the minds of men by the use of those controversial terms but rather something negativenamely a desire to exclude on one side the view that there are three gods and on the other the view that there is just one god of whom the father the son and the holy ghost are merely three aspects but so many learned and ingenious theologians have from time to time offered the world new explanations of mysteries claiming to have worked to get accurate ideas and wanting to recommend their discoveries and speculations to others as articles of faith what are we to make of them to all such innovators in religion i would say with hieronymus why after so many centuries do you claim to teach us something that hasnt been taught before why explain things that neither peter nor paul thought needed to be explained the explanation of mysteries in divinity is as futile as the pursuit of the philosophers stone see note on page in chemistry or the perpetual motion machine in mechanics but in each of the three cases the absurdity is to be blamed not on that branch of enquiry but only on wrongheaded people engaged in it what euphranor has been saying seems to be applicable also to other mysteries of our religion we may find it impossible to form an abstracted idea of original sin for example or an idea of how original sin is passed on from adam to the rest of us but the belief in it may produce in someones mind a salutary sense of his own unworthiness and of the goodness of his redeemer and from that may follow good habits and from them good actions which are the genuine effects of faith when faith is considered in its true light it can be seen to be neither inconsistent nor incomprehensible as some men want us to think it is but suited even to common capacities placed in the will and affections rather than in the understanding and producing holy lives rather than subtle theories faith isnt something you passively let flow into you its an operative conviction of mind which always produces some suitable action disposition or emotion in those who have it i could easily prove and illustrate this by countless instances taken from human affairs and indeed while the christian religion is considered as an institution fitted to ordinary minds rather than to the minds of hairsplitting theoreticians and while our notions about faith are accordingly taken from mankinds ordinary everyday life rather than from the special systems of faithimprovers i dont think it will be hard to understand the meaning and use of our belief in mysteries and to justify them against the most confident assertions and objections of the minute philosophers who can easily be caught in the very traps that they have set for others and that spirit of controversythe mother and nurse of heresieswould doubtless be much reduced if men would grasp that things should be rated not by their colour shape or trademark so truly as by their weight if some litigious theologians had proportioned their zeal to the importance of the opinions they were propounding that would greatly reduce the zealous intensity of most of what they had to say which would have spared them and us a great deal of trouble someone who takes his notions of faith opinion and assent from common sense and common usage and has maturely weighed the nature of signs and of language wont be so ready to quarrel about the wording of a mystery or to break the peace of the church so as to retain or reject a word heres a plain example that should convince you of the effective and necessary use of faith without ideas the example concerns a convinced minute philosopher a coarse and callous man with large appetites and not much money who has an opportunity to perform one villainous act that will make him richan act that he knows he can get away with what is there to deter him certainly not a sense of the beauty of virtue see alciphrons speech on pages in fact the only way to get some moral leverage on this man is to produce in him a sincere belief in a future state although it is a mystery although it is what eye has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive corinthians this belief will restrain him from carrying out his wicked project to a reasonable reflective philosophical mind the points insisted on by your refined beautyofvirtue moralists may be as lovely and excellent as you please but i venture to say that given mankind as it is very few people would be influenced by them so we see the necessary use of faith as well as its powerful effects and none of this involves having ideas you and euphranor apparently want to convince me that the belief in mysteries doesnt involve anything as utterly absurd as we are apt to think and that a man neednt renounce his reason to maintain his religion but if this is true why is it that mens faith dwindles in proportion as their knowledge grows i have learned from you alciphron that there is nothing like getting to the bottom of things and analysing them into their basic elements so ill try to do that with the question of the nature of faithyoull have to judge whether i succeed the objections that are made to faith dont come from knowledge but rather from ignorance of what knowledge is and that ignorance might be found even in people who are regarded as masters of this or that particular branch of knowledge science and faith have this in common they both involve an assent of the mind and as the nature of scientific assent is most clear and evident we should consider it first in order to cast a light on the assent involved in faith to trace things back to their origins the human mind needs aids that are not part of its basic natural equipment it is naturally furnished with the ideas of particular and concrete as distinct from abstract things and what its designed for is not merely being aware of its ideas but pursuing its own happiness by actively operating on the basis of them for the scientific pursuit of knowledge about the origins of things therefore the mind needs extra help specifically it needs certain general rules or theorems to guide it in this pursuit and the true original reasonable end of studying the arts and sciences is to acquire such rules because these rules are general they cant be obtained by the mere consideration of the original ideas or particular things but only by means of marks or signs and these being general in the sense that they are used for general purposes become the immediate instruments and materials of science so the mind makes its progress not by mere contemplation of particular things even less by contemplating abstract general ideas of things but by appropriately choosing and skillfully managing signs for example everyone knows about force and number in concrete situations along with things that accompany them things that have them and signs of them and noone has any understanding of force and number considered in the abstract and captured in precise abstract ideas so its clear that their abstract nature isnt a foundation for science and that merely considering their ideas in their concrete form isnt the way to advance in the respective sciences of physics and mathematics because nothing is more evident than that someone who cant read or write understands the meanings of numeral words in concrete situations as well as the best scientist or mathematician but here lies the difference the one who understands the notation of numbers can use it to express briefly and clearly all the variety and degrees of number and to perform easily and quickly many arithmetical operations by the help of general rules its obvious how useful these operations are in human life and equally obvious that performing them requires having an appropriate notation if mankind were in a very primitive state with no use of language they wouldnt know any truths of arithmetic their first step towards that science would be the acquisition of names for numbers so that they could signify numbers as high as you like by repeating those names in a certain order the next step would be to associate those names with visible markspermanent ones not like sounds which dont last if this system of marking this notation was done well it would make it easier for us to discover and apply general rules to assist the mind in reasoning and judging and in extending recording and communicating its knowledge about numbers what the mind is immediately concerned with in these activities are the signs or numerals through which it is directed to act in relation to things or number in concrete as the logicians call it without ever considering the simple abstract intellectual general idea of number i dont think it is hard to be convinced that the science of arithmetic is entirely concernedin its rise operations rules and theoremswith the conventional use of signs which are of two sorts names that are words and numerals these names and numerals are in their roles as signs universal the names are related to things the characters are related to the names and both names and characters are related to operations there arent many basic names of numbers the stock of them being enlarged by a certain analogy so a system of characters will be useful to the extent that it is simple and aptly expresses this analogy thus words written at length were less useful than the old roman numerals which in turn were less useful than the modern notation for example two hundred and fortyfour was less useful than ccxliv which was less useful than and the invention of algebraical symbols was a further advance for extensive and general use so there we have it arithmetic and algebra are sciences of great clearness certainty and extent whose immediate topic is signs on the skillful use and management of which they entirely depend perhaps a little attention to them may help us to understand the progress of the mind in other sciences which differ in nature design and purpose but may nevertheless agree in the general methods of proof and inquiry in my view all sciences that are universal and demonstrable by human reason will be found to have signs as their immediate object though in applying a science we connect these signs with things it isnt hard to grasp why this is so nothing is more natural for us than to use the things we do know as stepping stones towards things we dont know and to explain and represent less familiar things by others that are more familiar now it is certain that a before we reflect we imagine and b before we imagine we perceive by our senses and that c of all our senses eyesight is the most clear distinct various agreeable and comprehensive so its natural for us a to help the intellect by imagination b to help imagination by sense and c to help the other senses by sight hence figures metaphors and symbols we illustrate mental things by physical ones we substitute sounds for thoughts and written letters for sounds we use emblems symbols and hieroglyphics for things that are too obscure to strike our minds and too various or too fleeting to be retained we substitute imaginable things for intelligible ones sensible things for imaginable ones smaller things for ones that are too big to comprehend easily and larger things for ones that are too small to be clearly picked out present things for absent ones permanent things for perishing ones and visible things for invisible ones hence the use of models and diagrams thus lines are substituted for time velocity and other things of very different natures thus again we speak of minds in a figurative way describing their operations by terms borrowed from perceptible things such as apprehend conceive reflect discourse and the like apprehend comes from latin meaning seize conceive from take together reflect from bend back discourse from run to and fro euphranor talks a little about allegories eg platos representing the mind by the driver of a winged chariot which etc etc then im inclined to think that the doctrine of signs matters a great deal over a very wide area and that if it were properly considered it would cast a lot of light on things and provide a genuine solution for many difficulties so we can say this much about all signs they dont always suggest ideas signified to the mind when they do suggest ideas they arent general abstract ideas they have other uses such as raising proper emotions producing certain dispositions or habits of mind and directing our actions in pursuit of the happiness that is the ultimate end and design the primary spring and motive that sets rational agents at work the real purpose of speech whether it is being used in reasoning or in expressing theoretical knowledge or faith or some degree of belief is not primarily to give or get ideas but rather to guide actions aimed at bringing about some conceived good sometimes indeed words can lead to suitable actions not merely without communicating any ideas but without such ideas being even possible an example is the algebraic sign standing for the square root of a negative number this is useful in logical operations although it is impossible to have an idea of any such quantity as and what is true of algebraic signs is also true of words or language in fact modern algebra is a languagea compact appropriate artificial sort of languageand any algebraic calculation could be expressed by ordinary words much less conveniently but with nothing left out also theres no avoiding the fact that even the mathematical sciences themselvessupposed to the most clear and certain sciences that we haveoften fall short of the clear and distinct ideas that todays minute philosophers whether knowingly or ignorantly insist on in the mysteries of religion im talking here about mathematics considered as theory not about practical applied mathematics in absolutely any science or field of activity men will be sure to embarrass themselves with difficulties and disputes if they move from particulars to generalities from concrete things to abstractions or relinquish practical views and the useful purposes of knowledge in favour of barren theorising regarding means and instruments as ultimate ends and struggling to get the precise ideas that they suppose to be associated with all words im talking about difficulties and disputes such as the ones that have sprung up in geometry about the nature of the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent proportions indivisibles infinitesimals and various other matters despite all of which geometry itself is rightly admired as an excellent and useful science it really does prove useful in many reallife situations where it governs and directs the actions of men enabling them to do in a sound and accurate way things that would otherwise be faulty and uncertain and by parity of reasoning we shouldnt regard any other doctrines that govern influence or direct the mind of man to be less true or excellent because they provide material for controversy and useless theorizing by troublemakers this applies especially to the articles of our christian faith with regard to which belief leads to persuasion which in turn influences the lives and actions of men as for the perplexity of contradictions and abstracted notions that crop up in secular sciences and divine faith nitpickers may use it as an objection incautious people may stray into it while judicious people keep away from it the belief of christians can be justified without departing from the accepted rules of reasoning and if any pious men think otherwise thats probably a result not of religion or of reason but merely of human weakness if there are especially many unbelievers in our time i shant conclude that our time knows more than former agesonly that it is more arrogantly selfconfident and i dont think that this confidence is a result of much thought it seems to me that the more thoroughly and extensively any man investigates and thinks about the principles aims and methods that occur in secular arts and sciences the more convinced he will be that theres no weight in the plausible objections that are brought against the mysteries of faith and he wont have much difficulty maintaining and justifying his position using accepted methods of argument and the common principles of logic appealing to countless parallel cases all through the many branches of human knowledge in all of which the supposition of abstract ideas creates the same difficulties according to this doctrine anything can be maintained therell be nothing absurd in popery not even in transubstantiation the doctrine that in the sacrament of the eucharist the bread and wine become the body and blood of jesus pardon me what i have been saying doesnt justify any article of faith that isnt contained in scripture is in conflict with human reason implies a contradiction or leads to idolatry or wickedness of any kind those four disqualifiers are very different from not being representable by distinct or abstract ideas ill allow euphranor that your reasoning has all the force you meant it to have i freely admit that there may be mysteries that we can believe things that we dont understand and that faith can be useful even when what its about is not distinctly grasped in short i agree that there can be faith and mysteries in other thingsbut not in religion the plain reason for this is that its absurd to suppose there to be any such thing as religion and if theres no religion then there cant be religious faith or mysteries religion obviously implies the worship of a god which worship presupposes rewards and punishments which presuppose merits and demerits good and evil actions and these presuppose human freedom and that is impossible which means that religion which is built on it must be unreasonable and absurd it cant be reasonable to have fears where there is no guilt and there cant be guilt when everything that happens follows unavoidably from the structure of the world and the laws of motion here is what happens when a man as we say raises his hand to shade his eyes from the sun physical objects strike on his senseorgans specifically lightparticles strike his eyes those organs the eyes start a vibration in the nerves that vibration is passed along to the soul or animal spirits in the brain or root of the nerves see note on page starting up in them the kind of motion called volition the volition starts up a new movement in the animal spirits this causes the spirits to flow into certain nerves the events in those nerves cause bodily movements that constitute the action in question in our case cause his hand to go up over his eyes and all of this happens necessarily by the laws of mechanism so the events that we ordinarily take to be human actions should be regarded as mechanical and its just wrong to think they have a source that is free so there is no basis for praise or blame fear or hope reward or punishment and religion as i have already pointed out is built on and presupposes those things if i have understood you rightly alciphron you regard man as a sort of organ that is played on by external objects which produce different motions and effects in the organ depending on the different shapes and textures of the nerves the comparison with an organ is not bad but the best comparison is with a puppet certain particles coming in straight lines from all perceptible objects compose so many rays or filaments that push pull and activate every part of the soul and body of man just as threads or wires operate on the joints of the little wooden machine ordinarily called a puppet the only difference is that the puppets wires are thick and visible to ordinary eyes whereas the formerthe rays or filaments that enter into the causation of human socalled actionsare too fine and subtle to be spotted by any but an able freethinker this splendidly accounts for all the operations that we have been taught to ascribe to a source of thought within us thats an ingenious line of thought and must contribute greatly to freeing men from all anxiety about moral notions by tracing their actions not to a source in the human soul but rather to external things but i have some worries about it you suppose the mind to be in a literal sense moved and you take its volitions to be mere motions but suppose someone said and lets face it someone may that the soul is not a body that motion is one thing and volition another id like to know how you would go about convincing such a person your account will be very clear to those who accept that the soul is a body and that all its acts are merely motions given that basis our account of human nature is true fine and new but if someone denies your supposition that the soul is corporeala denial that its very easy to makethen everything you have built on it collapses if we grant that the soul is a body and volitions are motions we are certainly committed then to a fatal necessity ie to the view that all our actions are necessary in the sense that whatever we do we were fated to do bound to do inevitably going to do but i see no reason for granting those two points on the contrary it seems clear that motion and thought are two things as really and as obviously distinct from one another as a triangle is from a sound so it looks as though your argument for the necessity of human actions has a premise that needs to be proved just as badly as the conclusion does well if we suppose that the mind is not corporeal i can still prove my conclusion i shant baffle you with farfetched arguments and merely ask you to look into yourself and observe what happens when some object comes before your mind your understanding considers it then your judgment makes some decree about it as a thing to be chosen or rejected to be done or not done and if done then done thus and not so this decree of the judgment necessarily determines the will whose role is merely to carry out anything ordained by another faculty something necessary cant be free so theres no such thing as freedom of the will freedom is present only when there is an indifference to either side of the question ie when the deliberating mind is evenly poised between the alternatives a power to act or not act without being told what to do or in any way controlled by something external to the will and its obvious that the will cant be free when it doesnt have this indifference and this power and its equally obvious that the will is not indifferent in its actions being absolutely determined and governed by the faculty of judgment my point is not affected by the question of what it is that moves the judgmentwhether its the greatest present uneasiness as locke came to think or the greatest apparent good as many have thought including locke to begin with or something else again whatever it is that moves the judgment the fact remains that the will is always settled and controlled by the judgment and so is always subject to necessity nowhere in the entire human makeup is there anything like a free agent every faculty is determined in all its acts by something external to it the understanding for instance cant alter one of its ideasit necessarily sees each idea in the way that it presents itself the appetites are carried towards their respective objects by a natural necessity reason cant infer anything from anything just as it chooses it is limited by the nature and connection of things and the eternal rules of reasoning which means that it is subject to necessity and the same is true for all our other faculties as well as for the will itself as i have already shown and if we can believe the divine characterizer of our times the will must be agreed to be the most slavish of all our faculties the earl of shaftesbury author of characteristics of etc was widely liked and admired but even alciphron wouldnt call him divine in making him do so berkeley is throwing in a sarcastic jibe of his own some admirers of the present work regret its intemperate hostility to shaftesbury appetite says that noble writer which is reasons older and stronger brother is sure in every contest to be on the winning side as for the will so highly boasted of it is never better than a football for those youngsters to kick or a spinningtop for them to whip to keep it moving the youngsters turn out to be very illmatched and eventually the younger of them instead of now and then getting in a kick or a lash to little purpose leaves the ball or top and starts to kick or lash his older brother crito comments sarcastically on the style and manner of this beautiful parable and asks why the weaker brother would get satisfaction from attacking the stronger one alciphron brushes this off and then the same conclusion can also proved from gods foreknowledge whatever is certainly foreknown will certainly happen what will certainly happen is necessary necessary actions cant be the effect of freewill so now you have this fundamental thesis in our freethinking philosophy demonstrated in two different ways see qa note on page i the proposition that god creates something that is free is not selfcontradictory ii so it is possible that there may be such a thing as a free creature iii this is something that you can conceive and suppose iv such a free creature would think that he acted v and he would condemn himself for some actions and approve of himself for others vi he would think that he deserved reward or punishment vii and all these characteristics are actually found in man tell me now what other qualities does your supposed free agent haveones that are not to be found in man if there arent any we must conclude that man has all the marks of a free agent let me see i was certainly mistaken when i conceded that it was possible at least for almighty power to make such a thing as a free agent i wonder how i came to make such an absurd concession after what had been demonstrated in so many different ways certainly whatever doesnt imply a contradiction is possible for an infinite power and whatever is possible can be supposed therefore if rational agent isnt selfcontradictory then a rational agent can be supposed perhaps from this supposition i might infer that man is free but i wont suppose him to be a free agent since you apparently claim to have demonstrated that he isnt but listen its common knowledge that men base their opinions about others on themselves but when you reach a conclusion about me on the basis of what you know about yourself you may be mistaken many things that are clear to someone with your strength of intellect are not so clear to me who am often puzzled rather than enlightened by those very proofs that you regard as clear and evident i cant be thoroughly convinced by any inference however logically sound it is if its premises arent clear so please let me put questions to you your answers may sort out for me the things that at present i am confused about ill leave with you what i have already said for you to consider and chew over its time now for lysicles and me to set out for london so theres no time for a long questionandanswer session then let me make a couple of brief remarks on what you have said you take that for granted something that i cannot grant when you say that whatever is certain is necessary to me certain and necessary seem to be very different because theres nothing in certain that implies constraint and so theres nothing in it that isnt consistent with a mans being accountable for his actions if it is foreseen that suchandsuch an action will be done cant it also be foreseen that it will be done as an effect of human choice and liberty you delicately abstract and distinguish the actions of the mind judgment and will you use such terms as power faculty act determination indifference freedom necessity and so on as if they stood for distinct abstract ideas and this supposition seems to ensnare the mind into the same perplexities and errors that have been seen to accompany the doctrine of abstraction in every other context its selfevident that there is such a thing as motion and yet some philosophers have tried by refined reasoning to prove there is no such thing walking before them was thought the proper way to confute those ingenious men diogenes is reported to have said à propos of zenos difficulty about how there could be motion i solve it by walking it is equally obvious that man is a free agent and though by abstracted reasonings you might puzzle me and seem to prove that he isnt so long as i am conscious of my own actions this inward evidentness of a plain fact will bear me up against all your reasonings however subtle and refined they may be opposing plain propositions by obscure ones may convince me that your philosophers are clever but it wont convince me that their opinions are true i cant conceive why the acute cratylus shaftesburyin his football metaphor page should allow a power of acting to the appetite and to reason the brothers but not to the will the football if we allow that the mind does contain these three distinct beings i dont see how this could be true of them but i dont find it necessary to abstract and distinguish as many beings in the soul of man as you do which reconciles me to the fact that i cant do so without any such distinction it is evident to metaking myself as a whole not as minutely dissectedthat i am a free agent im not helped to go further by being told that the will is a governed by the judgment or that it is b determined by the object because a in no ordinary everyday case can i separate the decree of my judgment from the command of my will b i know that the sensible object is absolutely inert and so cant determine anything and lastly i am conscious that i am an active being who can and do determine myself i dont know what theoretical results i might get if were to suppose spiritual or mental things to be corporeal or to refine actual and real things into general abstracted notions or by metaphysical skill to split simple and individual things into many parts but if instead of any of that i take things as they are and ask any plain untutored man whether he acts or is free in this or that particular action he immediately says yes and i immediately believe him on the basis of what i find within myself and thus by an induction from particular cases i can draw the general conclusion that man is a free agent even if i cant define or conceive an abstract notion of freedom in general if a man is free he is clearly accountable and if you define and abstract and suppose and infer from your definitions abstractions and suppositions that there cant be any freedom in man and then infer from this that he isnt accountable i shall take the liberty of departing from your metaphysical abstracted sense and appealing to the common sense of mankind if we consider the notions people have of guilt and merit praise and blame accountable and unaccountable well find the question of whether to applaud or censure someone acquit or condemn him always rests on the question did he perform the action in question or what comes to the same thing was he himself when he performed it so it seems that in our ordinary everyday thought and talk a person is regarded as accountable if he is an agent you tell me that man is inactive and that perceptible objects act on him but my own experience assures me of the contrary i know i act and i am accountable for what i do in acting and if this is true then the foundation of religion and morality remains unshaken the only question in this area that religion is concerned with is whether the man is accountable and according to my sense and the worlds common sense he is accountable if he acts and its selfevident that he does act so the grounds and purposes of religion are secured whether or not your philosophic notion of liberty fits mans actions and whether or not his actions are certain or contingent does he deserve the guilt or merit of the action in asking that we arent asking did he do it with a free will or what determined his will when he did it or was it certain or foreknown that he would do it the only question is did he do it wilfully but still the question keeps coming back is man free to answer this oughtnt we first to settle what is meant by the word free we ought in my opinion a man is said to be free insofar as he can do what he wills to do isnt that right it seems so so a man who acts according to his will is to be accounted free i admit that this is right in the vulgar see note on page sense of free but a philosopher goes higher than that and asks whether a man is free to will that is whether he can will as he wills i dont know how philosophical it may be to ask this question but to me it seems very idle the notions of guilt and merit justice and reward are in mens minds in advance of any metaphysical lectures or chapters and according to those accepted natural notions there is no doubt that man is accountable that he acts that he is selfdetermined but a minute philosopher misled by wrong initial suppositions runs together things that are obviously distinct bodyspirit motionvolition certaintynecessity and an abstracter or refiner analyses the simplest instantaneous act of the mind to the point where he thinks he can find within it various faculties and tendencies principles and operations causes and effects note the symmetry identifying things that are really distinct and distinguishing things that are really identical and after he has abstracted supposed and reasoned concerning gratuitous and obscure principles he will conclude that the act in question isnt an act at all and that man is not an agent but a puppet or an organ played on by external objects and his will is a top or a football and this passes for philosophy and freethinking whatever it passes for it doesnt at all seem like a natural or sound way of thinking it seems to me that if we start from things that are particular and concrete and proceed from them to general notions and conclusions well have no trouble in this area but if we start with generalities and lay our foundations in abstract ideas well find ourselves entangled and lost in a labyrinth of our own making i neednt point outbecause anyone can see ithow ridiculous it is to claim to prove that man is not an agent while also pleading for free thought and action thus posing as advocates of necessity and of liberty i have hastily thrown together these hints or remarks about this fundamental thesis in our freethinking philosophy as you call it and about your method of arguing for it which seems to provide a fine specimen of the sophistry of abstract ideas if my brevity has led me to be inappropriately dogmatic you must excuse meyou started it by declining to join me in a leisurely examination of the truth i think we have examined matters sufficiently to everything you have said against human liberty it is a sufficient answer to point out that your arguments are wrong from the outseteither because they suppose the soul to be corporeal or because they rely on abstract ideas supposing the soul to be solid is no better than supposing it to be red or blue supposing the will to consist in motion is no better than supposing the will to be you name it these premises about the soul and the will are to put it mildly neither proved nor probable and i see no obstacle to rejecting everything you infer from them and your arguments also contain other gross mistakes and baseless principles in any human action you distinguish the last decree of the judgment from the act of the will you confuse certainty with necessity you ask in effect the absurd question can a man will as he wills the proposition a man wills as he wills is an identical one ie a necessarily true logical triviality that is obviously the case which means that obviously there must be something wrong with the line of thought that led you to make a question of it you say that the appetites have by natural necessity a tendency towards their respective objects i agree and i add my agreement that appetites are not free but you go further telling us the understanding cant alter an idea that it has nor can it infer indifferently anything from anything just as it chooses what of it if we cant alter the nature of objects does that mean that we cant act at all the two versions of reflect berkeleys viewdefended in other works but mainly not in play in this onethat the objects that we perceive and talk about are ideas and if we arent at liberty to make absurd inferences does it follow that we arent free in any way you take it for granted that the mind is inactive but that its ideas act on it as if the contrary werent evident to everyone who has the common sense to know that when the mind considers its ideas it chooses rejects examines deliberates decreesie it acts on them and they dont act on it summing up because your premises are obscure and false the basic point that you claim to have demonstrated in so many different ways isnt shown to be true or even meaningful and on the other hand we dont have to do much research to be convinced that man acts and that man is accountable for his actions nothing is clearer or more obvious than those two propositions nothing is more universally accepted by men of all sorts learned and unlearned at all times and in all places whatever may be claimed by abstracters refiners and men who are committed to a false hypothesis i think it is obvious to every thinking man of common sense that human minds are so far from being machines or footballs acted on and kicked around by corporeal objects with no inner source of freedom or of action that the only basic true notions we have of freedom agent and action are ones we get by reflecting on ourselves and the operations of our own minds the minute philosophers allow themselves to be taken in by the invalid inferences of three or four eminent bishops of unbelief in recent times i cant think of anything that matches their unique credulity ie any other bigoted superstition whose ringleaders have been able so openly and widely to draw their followers from the plain dictates of nature and common sense the discoverers of truth have always met up with the objection that they are departing from accepted opinions the sneering label unique is a tax on freethinking and as such we most willingly accept it and glory in it a genuine philosopher is never modest in such a way as to prefer authority to reason or an old and common opinion to a true one such false modesty discourages men from treading in untrodden paths and from shining new light and that makes it a greater enemy to freethinking than any other personal quality a judicious person who will follow evidence wherever it leads will also allow authority to have its due weight on disputable points without preferring authority we can accept it as a good backup to reason so your gentlemen of the minute philosophy can save yourself the trouble of announcing all those commonplaces about reason and discoveries and light we arent attached to authority against reason or afraid of untrodden paths that lead to truth and we are ready to follow a new light once we are sure it isnt a willothewisp reason may oblige a man to believe something that he doesnt like but why should a man give up salutary notions in favour of others that are as unreasonable as they are harmful your schemes principles and boasted demonstrations have been proposed and examined at length you have shifted your notions successively retreated from one scheme to another and in the end renounced them all your objections to christianity have been treated in the same manner and with the same outcome if from the things you have held against christianity we set aside everything that comes from the errors and faults of particular persons and difficulties which from the nature of things we arent obliged to explain it is surprising to see how little remainsafter such magnificent threatsthat can amount to a relevant objection against the christian religion what you have produced has been tried by the fair test of reason and even if you hope to get the upper hand through ridicule when you cant get it through reason i predict that in the upshot youll find that you cant destroy all sense of religion how berkeley starts the next sentence make your countrymen ever so vicious ignorant and profane either he meant however vicious ignorant and profane you claim your countrymen to be or he meant however vicious ignorant and profane you cause your countrymen to be men will still be disposed to look up to a supreme being religion right or wrong will survive in some shape or other and there will surely be some worship either of god or the creature that is berkeleys phrasemeaning as for your ridicule well your sect presents us with the spectacle of the most unintelligible men of the age parading themselves as freethinkers men so strong in assertion yet so weak in argument advocates for freedom introducing necessity patriots trampling on the laws of their country claimants to virtue destroying the motives for virtue can anything be more ridiculous than that let any impartial man cast an eye on the opinions of the minute philosophers and then say if anything can be more ridiculous than to believe such things and at the same time laugh at the credulity of others say what you will we have the laughers on our side and as for your reasoning i take that to be another name for sophistry and i suppose by the same rule you take your own sophisms to be arguments let me be frank about this i dont know of any type of sophismany type of logical mistakethat minute philosophers dont use against religion they are guilty of working from false assumptions in taking it for granted that we believe contradictions of bad causal thinking in asserting that uncharitable feuds and discords are the effects of christianity and of pointmissing in demanding that we demonstrate things that we only claim to believe as matters of faith crito gives each of these a technical latin label speaking for myself if sophistry is the art or power of deceiving other men i must acquit these gentlemen of it they seem to have led me on a journey through atheism libertinism fanaticism and fatalism not to convince me of the truth of any of them so much as to confirm me in my own way of thinking they have displayed their flimsy wares not to cheat but to amuse us knowing them to be selfannounced masters of ridicule i dont know what seriously to make of them you dont know what to make of us id be sorry if you did only a superficial philosopher can be quickly fathomed creating ambiguity about where one stands seems to be the sure way to fame and esteem in the learned world as it now is when an able reader cant decide whether his author is atheist or deist or polytheist stoic or epicurean sceptic or dogmatist unbeliever or religious fanatic joking or serious he immediately concludes that the author is enigmatic and deep in fact its true of the most admired writers of our time that noone can tell what to make of them or what they are getting at we have among us moles that dig deep under ground and eagles that soar out of sight we can act all parts and become all opinions putting them on or off with great freedom of wit and humour it seems then that you are a pair of inscrutable unfathomable fashionable philosophers that cant be denied but i remember that you started off with an open dogmatic air talked of plain principles and evident reasoning and promised to make things as clear as noonday to wipe out wrong notions and plant right ones in their place before long though you began to back away from your first notions and adopt others you advanced one while retracting another asserted and conceded said and unsaid and after having followed you through so many untrodden paths and intricate mazes i find myself no nearer to understanding what you actually think didnt we tell you that the gentlemen of our sect are very good at teasing but it seems to me to be useless for a plain man with some settled beliefs or principles to do battle with such slippery dodging changeable philosophers the rule seems to be the christian man must stand still in one place while his freethinking adversary chooses and changes his fightingposition has full range and liberty to move around the battlefield and attack his christian opponent on all sides in all shapes from close up or with missiles from far away on horseback or on foot in light or heavy armour theres no denying that a gentleman has a great advantage over a straitlaced pedant or bigot but at the end of it all how am i better off from the conversation of two such knowledgeable gentlemen i hoped to unlearn my errors and to learn truths from you but i find to my great disappointment that i havent been untaught anything or taught anything its hard to unteach men their prejudices but that has to be done before we can offer to teach them the truth and anyway we dont now have time to prove and argue the ensuing remarks about laws of hospitality confinement in the castle etc are a running joke it looks like a rather thin cover for the anger and contempt that have been building up especially on the christian side well suppose that my mind is white paper and that you are invited to write on it the things that you would teach me if only i were teachable dont try to wipe out my present opinions or to prove your own for once dont joke or tease just let me know some one conclusion of yours before we part if you dont ill beg crito to violate the laws of hospitality towards those who have violated the laws of philosophy by hanging out false lights to someone who isaccording to youbenighted in ignorance and error false lights were lights placed on the seashore in a position that is likely to draw a ship onto the rocks i appeal to you shouldnt these philosophical knighterrants be confined in this castle of yours until they make reparation euphranor is right said crito and my sentence is that you remain here in prison until you have done something towards satisfying my undertaking to euphranor which was that he would know your opinions from yourselves which you also agreed to since it must be so i will now reveal what i take to be the sum and substance the grand arcanum see note on page and final conclusion of our sect i can do it in two words and he utters a twogreekword sentence which means there are only hypotheses so youre a downright sceptic but sceptic as you are you admit that it is probable that there is a god certain that the christian religion is useful possible that it is true certain that if it is true the minute philosophers are in bad shape given all this how can there be any question about what course a wise man should take whether the principles of christians or unbelievers are truest may be made a question but there is no question about which are safest if you have doubts about all opinions you must have doubts about your own which means that for all you know christianity may be true the more doubt the more room there is for faith because a sceptic has less right than anyone else to demand evidence evidentness but whatever uncertainty there may be about some things this much is certain either there is a god or there isnt either there is a revelation or there isnt either man is an agent or he isnt either the soul is immortal or it isnt if the negatives are not sure the affirmatives are possible if the negatives are improbable the affirmatives are probable the more any of your able men finds himself unable to prove any one of these negatives the stronger grounds he has to suspect he may be mistaken so a minute philosopher who wants to act consistently ought to share with the sceptic not merely the sceptics doubts but also his diffidence his modesty and his timidity he shouldnt announce an ocean of light and then lead us to an abyss of darkness if that conduct isnt ridiculous i dont know what ridiculous means as for your ridiculing something that may for all you know be truei cant make any sense of that it isnt acting as a wise man with regard to your own interests or as a good man with regard to the interests of your country cicero says somewhere let us either get rid of religion altogether or retain it altogether if there is a single instance of a people prospering without any religion propose in the british parliament that we change our constitution and live without religion if there is any religion better than christianity propose to the parliament that we introduce that new religion a sceptic is a member of a community just like any other man and he can distinguish good from evil whether natural or political and his knowledge of this distinction should be his guide as a patriot even though he isnt a christian and if he doesnt claim to know even this much he should stop claiming to correct or alter something that he knows nothing about also someone who merely doubts shouldnt behave as if he could demonstrate consider someone who says i find my country in possession of certain tenets namely those of christianity they appear to do good which is why they are encouraged by the legislature they are a main part of our constitution and i dont find that these freethinking innovators can disprove them or substitute things more useful and certain in their place so i shall go along with those tenets out of regard for the good of mankind and for the laws of my country i dont say that this man is a christian but i regard him as a patriot with something that matters as much as christianity does not to inquire is folly but it is even greater folly to condemn without inquiring lysicles seemed heartily tired of this conversation it is now late he said to alciphron and everything is ready for our departure everyone has his own way of thinking and i can no more adopt another mans way of thinking than i can adopt his complexion and facial features alciphron pleaded that they had complied with euphranors conditions for being released from the castle and that they should now be set free and euphranor answered that he had no further claims to makeall he had wanted was to know their tenets epilogue after the philosophers had left i remarked to crito that it was hard to understand how men who are so easy to confute should be so difficult to convince aristotle explains this said crito he says that arguments dont have an effect on everyone but only on those whose minds are prepared by upbringing and habits as land is prepared for seed nichomachean ethics however clear a point is the odds are that it wont be understood by someone whose habits and cast of mind go against it so weak a thing is reason when in competition with inclination i replied that this answer might hold with respect to some people at some times but that it didnt seem satisfactory when applied to inquiring men at a time when reason is so much cultivated and thinking so much in vogue a man who is a keen social observer said crito has said that these days thinking is talked of more than it was in ancient times but practised less and that since the revival of learning men have read much and written much but thought little so that for us thinking closely and soundly is a tiny part of what a learned man does and doesnt figure at all in the activities of the socially polished man the freethinkers it must be admitted parade themselves as thinkers but dont show much exactness in their thinking a lively man and what the world calls a man of sense are often no good at all at thinking the ability to think is not a mere gift of nature but must be improved and perfected by much attention and exercise on very different subjects which means that it requires more time and trouble than todays quickoffthemark men care to takethose are the views of a judicious friend of mine if you arent already sufficiently convinced of their truth you need only look at the dark confused admired writers of this famous sect then youll be able to judge whether those who are led by men whose heads are so wrong can have very good heads of their own take for example spinoza the great leader of our modern unbelievers whose writings contain many schemes and notions that have been much admired and followed in recent years for example undermining religion under the pretence of vindicating and explaining it maintaining that it isnt necessary to believe in christ according to the flesh persuading men that miracles are to be understood only in a spiritual and allegorical sense that vice is not as bad a thing as we are apt to think that men are mere machines impelled by fatal necessity i remarked i have heard spinoza described as a man of close argument and demonstration he did indeed demonstrate replied crito but by his standards anyone could demonstrate anything if a man is allowed the privilege of making his own definitions of common words it will be easy for him to demonstrate conclusions that are true in one sense and false in anothertrue and indeed manifest truisms in his sense but false and indeed seeming paradoxes when the words are taken in their ordinary senses for example let spinoza define natural right to be natural power and he will easily demonstrate that whatever a man can do he has a right to do the folly of this procedure is utterly obvious but our freethinkers who claim to have the lumen siccum are so passionately prejudiced against religion that theyll accept as demonstrations the grossest nonsense and sophistry of weak and wicked writers lumen siccum is latin for dry light it comes from bacons brilliant metaphor the human intellect doesnt burn with a dry light because what the person wants and feels gets pumped into it and these men make so much noise with their thinking reasoning and demonstrating that they prejudice some wellmeaning people against all use and improvement of reason one man saw a neighbour of his ruined by the vices of a freethinking son and acquired such a prejudice against thinking that he wouldnt let his own son read euclid because he had been told that it might teach him to think he was rescued from this by a friend who convinced him that the epidemic was not an outbreak of thinking but merely an unthinking pretence of thinking i know one eminent freethinker who never goes to bed without a gallon of wine in his belly and he always replenishes it before the fumes have left his brain so that he hasnt had one sober thought in the past seven years he adds two more anecdotes reporting disgraceful behaviour by freethinkers then it is strange said crito that such men should parade themselves as freethinkers but its even stranger that other men should be on bad terms with thinking and reasoning because of such pretenders i answered that some good men thought there is an opposition between reason and religion knowledge and faith nature and grace and were led by that to conclude that the way to promote religion is to quench the light of nature and to discourage all rational inquiry i shant comment on the intentions of these men replied crito but surely their notions are very wrong what could dishonour religion more than representing it as an unreasonable unnatural ignorant institution god is the father of all lights natural as well as revealed natural greed is one thing and the natural light is another and you cant argue that because one is bad so is the other similarly you cant argue that because false knowledge is bad that real knowledge is bad also so whatever is said about one of them in the bible is not to be interpreted as having said something about the other i insisted that human learning in the hands of theologians had from time to time created great disputes and divisions in the church just as abstracted metaphysics have always tended to produce disputes among christians as well as other men said crito it should seem that genuine truth and knowledge would calm this mood that makes men sacrifice the undisputed duties of peace and charity to disputable notions after all i said whatever may be said for reason the sceptics and unbelievers of today wont be cured by it i wont dispute that said crito to cure an illness you should consider what produced it if men had reasoned themselves into a wrong opinion one might hope to reason them out of it but thats not how things stand the unbelief of minute philosophers seems to arise from things very different from thought and reason people are often turned into unbelievers by little incidents vanity disgust mood inclination without any help from reason faced with a doctrine whose general tendency one finds disagreeable the mind is prepared to enjoy and improve everything that can possibly be thought to count against it thus someones reason for his unbelief may be the coarse manners of some country curate the polished manners of a great familys chaplain the wit of a minute philosopher a joke a song a tale vice laziness quarrelsomeness and fashion produce minute philosophers and quite a lot of people become minute philosophers through sheer bad temper who can expect such an irrational and capricious thing should yield to reason still it may be worthwhile to argue against such men and expose their fallacies if not for their sake then for the sake of others who might otherwise be swayed by them the most general pretext that looks like a reason is the one that points to the variety of opinions about religion this is a rock for a lazy and superficial mind to sit on and take a rest but a more spirited mind with a sounder way of thinking will stand on it and look around examining and comparing the differing institutions of religion he will want to know of all these which is the most sublime and rational in its doctrines the most venerable in its mysteries most useful in its commands most decent in its worship which creates the noblest hopes and most worthy views he will consider their rise and progress and try to discover which owes least to human arts or arms which flatters the senses and gross inclinations of men which adorns and improves the most excellent part of our nature which has been propagated in the most wonderful manner which has overcome the greatest difficulties or showed the most disinterested not self interested zeal and sincerity in its adherents he will inquire into which squares best with nature and history he will consider which savours of the world and which looks like wisdom from above hell be careful to separate human alloy from anything that is divine and overall he will form his judgment like a reasonable freethinker but instead of taking such a rational course one of those hasty sceptics will conclude straight off that theres no wisdom in politics no honesty in business no knowledge in philosophy no truth in religion and all by the same sort of inference from premises about the numerous examples of folly knavery ignorance and error that are to be met with in the world and because people who know nothing about anything think they are sharpsighted in religion this learned sophism is oftenest levelled against christianity in my opinion if you want to convince an unbeliever who can be brought to reason you should start by clearly convincing him of the existence of a god because it seems to me that a real theist cant be an enemy to the christian religion and that what basically makes someone a minute philosopher is his ignorance or disbelief about gods existence those who are acquainted with the great authors in the minute philosophy presumably dont need to be told this that god exists can be clearly proved and is a proper object of human reason whereas the mysteries of his natureand indeed any other mysteries there are in religioncant possibly be explained and proved by reason it is sufficient if we show that theres nothing absurd or selfcontradictory in our beliefs on those matters and instead of forming hypotheses to explain them use our reason only for answering the objections brought against them but we ought always to distinguish the serious modest honest man of sense who has doubts about religion and behaves like a prudent man in doubt from the minute philosophers those profane and conceited men who insist on trying to convert others to their own doubts when someone of this kind presents himself we should consider what species he belongs to firsthand philosopher secondhand philosopher libertine scorner sceptic each type requires its own special treatment some men are too ignorant to be humble and without humility nothing can be learned but though a man cant be convinced of anything unless he has done some thinking and considering even the most ignorant and thoughtless can sometimes be laughed out of their opinions i once saw a bright woman get the better of two minute philosophers by taking her cue from their predominant claims about themselves to the one who claimed to be the most incredulous man upon earth she remarked that for someone who was credulous enough to trust the most valuable thingshis life and his fortuneto his pharmacist and his lawyer it was absurd to claim to be too incredulous to trust his soul a mere trifle according to him to his parishpriest to the other a nattily dressed dandy who said that he favoured the most unbounded freedom she remarked that he was an absolute slave in matters of dress to him the most important thing in the world while he was earnestly contending for freedom of thinking which was something he never bothered to do there are very few firsthand minute philosophers not enough of them to matter in themselves but their followers who pin their faith on them are numerous and are as confident as they are credulous and they do matter because theres something in the air and manner of these secondhand philosophers that is very apt to disconcert a serious man who believes in argumentits much harder to put up with than the weight of their objections euphranor suggested that it would be greatly to the publics benefit if instead of discouraging freethinking there was erected a dianoetic academy thinktank or seminary for freethinkers provided with quiet rooms and galleries and shady walks and groves where after seven years of silence and meditation a man might become a genuine freethinker and from then on be legally entitled to think what he pleased and have a badge to distinguish him from counterfeits really seriously said crito i think that what the present time needs most is more thinking and that the real cause of whatever is wrong can fairly be attributed to the general neglect of education in those who need it most namely the people of fashion what can be expected when those who have the most influence have the least sense and those who are sure to be followed set the worst example when the young are so uneducated and yet are heard from so much when modesty is regarded as feebleness and a deference to years knowledge religion and laws is regarded as a lack of sense and spirit he evidently means that modesty etc are regarded etc by the young because he goes on such precocious development wouldnt have been valued or encouraged by the wise men of antiquity whose views on this matter are so out of line with the spirit of our times that modern ears im afraid couldnt bear them what im going to say would seem ridiculous to our british youth who are so full of ideas and so boldly in favour of trying out new things and setting their country to rights but i think it will be accepted by men of sense it is this if todays governments would try as an experiment to consider themselves in that old homeric light as pastors of the people whose duty it was to improve their flock they would soon find that this requires a very different kind of upbringing from the modern one and different maxims from those of the minute philosophy if our youth were really accustomed to thought and reflection and an acquaintance with the excellent writers of antiquity wed see the licentious frame of mind commonly called freethinking banished from the presence of gentlemen along with ignorance and bad taste and one reform in how the young are brought up needs special attention as things are men follow vice for the sake of pleasure and fly from virtue because they hate pain so what is needed is for young minds to be formed and accustomed to receive pleasure and pain from proper objects ie to have their inclinations and aversions pointed in the right directions anyone who feels the cursed effects of a wrong upbringingin his mind his health or his fortuneshould ponder this thought there is no better way for you to make amends for what is wrong in yourself than preventing it from being wrong also in your descendants while crito was saying this other guests came in which put an end to our conversation
