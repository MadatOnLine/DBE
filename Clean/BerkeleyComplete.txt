a treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge wherein the chief causes of error and difficulty in the sciences with the grounds of scepticism atheism and irreligion are inquired into first printed in the year to which are added three dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to scepticks and atheists first printed in the year both written by george berkeley a fellow of trinitycollege dublin london printed for jacob tonson introduction philosophy being nothing else but the study of wisdom and truth it may with reason be expected that those who have spent most time and pains in it should enjoy a greater calm and serenity of mind a greater clearness and evidence of knowledge and be less disturbed with doubts and difficulties than other men yet so it is we see the illiterate bulk of mankind that walk the highroad of plain common sense and are governed by the dictates of nature for the most part easy and undisturbed to them nothing thats familiar appears unaccountable or difficult to comprehend they complain not of any want of evidence in their senses and are out of all danger of becoming sceptics but no sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a superior principle to reason meditate and reflect on the nature of things but a thousand scruples spring up in our minds concerning those things which before we seemed fully to comprehend prejudices and errors of sense do from all parts discover themselves to our view and endeavouring to correct these by reason we are insensibly drawn into uncouth paradoxes difficulties and inconsistencies which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in speculation till at length having wanderd through many intricate mazes we find our selves just where we were or which is worse sit down in a forlorn scepticism the cause of this is thought to be the obscurity of things or the natural weakness and imperfection of our understandings it is said the faculties we have are few and those designed by nature for the support and comfort of life and not to penetrate into the inward essence and constitution of things besides the mind of man being finite when it treats of things which partake of infinity it is not to be wondered at if it run into absurdities and contradictions out of which it is impossible it should ever extricate it self it being of the nature of infinite not to be comprehended by that which is finite but perhaps we may be too partial to our selves in placing the fault originally in our faculties and not rather in the wrong use we make of them it is a hard thing to suppose that right deductions from true principles should ever end in consequences which cannot be maintained or made consistent we should believe that god has dealt more bountifully with the sons of men than to give them a strong desire for that knowledge which he had placed quite out of their reach this were not agreeable to the wonted indulgent methods of providence which whatever appetites it may have implanted in the creatures doth usually furnish them with such means as if rightly made use of will not fail to satisfy them upon the whole i am inclined to think that the far greater part if not all of those difficulties which have hitherto amusd philosophers and blockd up the way to knowledge are intirely owing to our selves that we have first raisd a dust and then complain we cannot see my purpose therefore is to try if i can discover what those principles are which have introduced all that doubtfulness and uncertainty those absurdities and contradictions into the several sects of philosophy insomuch that the wisest men have thought our ignorance incurable conceiving it to arise from the natural dulness and limitation of our faculties and surely it is a work well deserving our pains to make a strict inquiry concerning the first principles of humane knowledge to sift and examine them on all sides especially since there may be some grounds to suspect that those lets and difficulties which stay and embarass the mind in its search after truth do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the objects or natural defect in the understanding so much as from false principles which have been insisted on and might have been avoided how difficult and discouraging soever this attempt may seem when i consider how many great and extraordinary men have gone before me in the same designs yet i am not without some hopes upon the consideration that the largest views are not always the clearest and that he who is shortsighted will be obliged to draw the object nearer and may perhaps by a close and narrow survey discern that which had escaped far better eyes in order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceiving what follows it is proper to premise somewhat by way of introduction concerning the nature and abuse of language but the unraveling this matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my design by taking notice of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering speculation intricate and perplexed and to have occasioned innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all parts of knowledge and that is the opinion that the mind hath a power of framing abstract ideas or notions of things he who is not a perfect stranger to the writings and disputes of philosophers must needs acknowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract ideas these are in a more especial manner thought to be the object of those sciences which go by the name of logic and metaphysics and of all that which passes under the notion of the most abstracted and sublime learning in all which one shall scarce find any question handled in such a manner as does not suppose their existence in the mind and that it is well acquainted with them it is agreed on all hands that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by it self and separated from all others but are mixd as it were and blended together several in the same object but we are told the mind being able to consider each quality singly or abstracted from those other qualities with which it is united does by that means frame to it self abstract ideas for example there is perceived by sight an object extended coloured and moved this mixd or compound idea the mind resolving into its simple constituent parts and viewing each by it self exclusive of the rest does frame the abstract ideas of extension colour and motion not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without extension but only that the mind can frame to it self by abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension again the mind having observed that in the particular extensions perceivd by sense there is something common and alike in all and some other things peculiar as this or that figure or magnitude which distinguish them one from another it considers apart or singles out by it self that which is common making thereof a most abstract idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid nor has any figure or magnitude but is an idea intirely prescinded from all these so likewise the mind by leaving out of the particular colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes them one from another and retaining that only which is common to all makes an idea of colour in abstract which is neither red nor blue nor white nor any other determinate colour and in like manner by considering motion abstractedly not only from the body moved but likewise from the figure it describes and all particular directions and velocities the abstract idea of motion is framed which equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever that may be perceived by sense and as the mind frames to it self abstract ideas of qualities or modes so does it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compounded beings which include several coexistent qualities for example the mind having observed that peter james and john resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities leaves out of the complex or compounded idea it has of peter james and any other particular man that which is peculiar to each retaining only what is common to all and so makes an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally partake abstracting intirely from and cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might determine it to any particular existence and after this manner it is said we come by the abstract idea of man or if you please humanity or humane nature wherein it is true there is included colour because there is no man but has some colour but then it can be neither white nor black nor any particular colour because there is no one particular colour wherein all men partake so likewise there is included stature but then it is neither tall stature nor low stature nor yet middle stature but something abstracted from all these and so of the rest moreover there being a great variety of other creatures that partake in some parts but not all of the complex idea of man the mind leaving out those parts which are peculiar to men and retaining those only which are common to all the living creatures frameth the idea of animal which abstracts not only from all particular men but also all birds beasts fishes and insects the constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal are body life sense and spontaneous motion by body is meant body without any particular shape or figure there being no one shape or figure common to all animals without covering either of hair or feathers or scales c nor yet naked hair feathers scales and nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular animals and for that reason left out of the abstract idea upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walking nor flying nor creeping it is nevertheless a motion but what that motion is it is not easy to conceive whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas they best can tell for my self i find indeed i have a faculty of imagining or representing to myself the ideas of those particular things i have perceived and of variously compounding and dividing them i can imagine a man with two heads or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse i can consider the hand the eye the nose each by it self abstracted or separated from the rest of the body but then whatever hand or eye i imagine it must have some particular shape and colour likewise the idea of man that i frame to my self must be either of a white or a black or a tawny a straight or a crooked a tall or a low or a middlesized man i cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described and it is equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving and which is neither swift nor slow curvilinear nor rectilinear and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever to be plain i own my self able to abstract in one sense as when i consider some particular parts or qualities separated from others with which though they are united in some object yet it is possible they may really exist without them but i deny that i can abstract one from another or conceive separately those qualities which it is impossible should exist so separated or that i can frame a general notion by abstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid which two last are the proper acceptations of abstraction and there are grounds to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case the generality of men which are simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions it is said they are difficult and not to be attained without pains and study we may therefore reasonably conclude that if such there be they are confined only to the learned i proceed to examine what can be alledged in defence of the doctrine of abstraction and try if i can discover what it is that inclines the men of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as that seems to be there has been a late deservedly esteemed philosopher who no doubt has given it very much countenance by seeming to think the having abstract general ideas is what puts the widest difference in point of understanding betwixt man and beast the having of general ideas saith he is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain unto for it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting or making general ideas since they have no use of words or any other general signs and a little after therefore i think we may suppose that it is in this that the species of brutes are discriminated from men and tis that proper difference wherein they are wholly separated and which at last widens to so wide a distance for if they have any ideas at all and are not bare machines as some would have them we cannot deny them to have some reason it seems as evident to me that they do some of them in certain instances reason as that they have sense but it is only in particular ideas just as they receive them from their senses they are the best of them tied up within those narrow bounds and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction essay on hum underst b sect and i readily agree with this learned author that the faculties of brutes can by no means attain to abstraction but then if this be made the distinguishing property of that sort of animals i fear a great many of those that pass for men must be reckoned into their number the reason that is here assigned why we have no grounds to think brutes have abstract general ideas is that we observe in them no use of words or any other general signs which is built on this supposition to wit that the making use of words implies the having general ideas from which it follows that men who use language are able to abstract or generalize their ideas that this is the sense and arguing of the author will further appear by his answering the question he in another place puts since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms his answer is words become general by being made the signs of general ideas essay on hum underst b sect but it seems that a word becomes general by being made the sign not of an abstract general idea but of several particular ideas any one of which it indifferently suggests to the mind for example when it is said the change of motion is proportional to the impressed force or that whatever has extension is divisible these propositions are to be understood of motion and extension in general and nevertheless it will not follow that they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without a body moved or any determinate direction and velocity or that i must conceive an abstract general idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid neither great nor small black white nor red nor of any other determinate colour it is only implied that whatever motion i consider whether it be swift or slow perpendicular horizontal or oblique or in whatever object the axiom concerning it holds equally true as does the other of every particular extension it matters not whether line surface or solid whether of this or that magnitude or figure by observing how ideas become general we may the better judge how words are made so and here it is to be noted that i do not deny absolutely there are general ideas but only that there are any abstract general ideas for in the passages above quoted wherein there is mention of general ideas it is always supposed that they are formed by abstraction after the manner set forth in sect viii and now if we will annex a meaning to our words and speak only of what we can conceive i believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which considered in it self is particular becomes general by being made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort to make this plain by an example suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts he draws for instance a black line of an inch in length this which in it self is a particular line is nevertheless with regard to its signification general since as it is there used it represents all particular lines whatsoever so that what is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines or in other words of a line in general and as that particular line becomes general by being made a sign so the name line which taken absolutely is particular by being a sign is made general and as the former owes its generality not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line but of all particular right lines that may possibly exist so the latter must be thought to derive its generality from the same cause namely the various particular lines which it indifferently denotes to give the reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas and the uses they are thought necessary to i shall add one more passage out of the essay on human understanding which is as follows abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine for example does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which is yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together it is true the mind in this imperfect state has need of such ideas and makes all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it is naturally very much inclined but yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection at least this is enough to shew that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with nor such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about b sect if any man has the faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle as is here described it is in vain to pretend to dispute him out of it nor would i go about it all i desire is that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he has such an idea or no and this methinks can be no hard task for anyone to perform what more easy than for anyone to look a little into his own thoughts and there try whether he has or can attain to have an idea that shall correspond with the description that is here given of the general idea of a triangle which is neither oblique nor rectangle equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once much is here said of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them and the pains and skill requisite to the forming them and it is on all hands agreed that there is need of great toil and labour of the mind to emancipate our thoughts from particular objects and raise them to those sublime speculations that are conversant about abstract ideas from all which the natural consequence should seem to be that so difficult a thing as the forming abstract ideas was not necessary for communication which is so easy and familiar to all sorts of men but we are told if they seem obvious and easy to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so now i would fain know at what time it is men are imployed in surmounting that difficulty and furnishing themselves with those necessary helps for discourse it cannot be when they are grown up for then it seems they are not conscious of any such painstaking it remains therefore to be the business of their childhood and surely the great and multiplied labour of framing abstract notions will be found a hard task for that tender age is it not a hard thing to imagine that a couple of children cannot prate together of their sugarplumbs and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets till they have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies and so framed in their minds abstract general ideas and annexed them to every common name they make use of nor do i think them a whit more needful for the enlargement of knowledge than for communication it is i know a point much insisted on that all knowledge and demonstration are about universal notions to which i fully agree but then it doth not appear to me that those notions are formed by abstraction in the manner premised universality so far as i can comprehend not consisting in the absolute positive nature or conception of any thing but in the relation it bears to the particulars signified or represented by it by virtue whereof it is that things names or notions being in their own nature particular are rendered universal thus when i demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles it is to be supposed that i have in view the universal idea of a triangle which ought not to be understood as if i could frame an idea of a triangle which was neither equilateral nor scalenon nor equicrural but only that the particular triangle i consider whether of this or that sort it matters not doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever and is in that sense universal all which seems very plain and not to include any difficulty in it but here it will be demanded how we can know any proposition to be true of all particular triangles except we have first seen it demonstrated of the abstract idea of a triangle which equally agrees to all for because a property may be demonstrated to agree to some one particular triangle it will not thence follow that it equally belongs to any other triangle which in all respects is not the same with it for example having demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles rectangular triangle are equal to two right ones i cannot therefore conclude this affection agrees to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal sides it seems therefore that to be certain this proposition is universally true we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular triangle which is impossible or once for all demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle in which all the particulars do indifferently partake and by which they are all equally represented to which i answer that though the idea i have in view whilst i make the demonstration be for instance that of an isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a determinate length i may nevertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or bigness soever and that because neither the right angle nor the equality nor determinate length of the sides are at all concerned in the demonstration it is true the diagram i have in view includes all these particulars but then there is not the least mention made of them in the proof of the proposition it is not said the three angles are equal to two right ones because one of them is a right angle or because the sides comprehending it are of the same length which sufficiently shews that the right angle might have been oblique and the sides unequal and for all that the demonstration have held good and for this reason it is that i conclude that to be true of any obliquangular or scalenon which i had demonstrated of a particular rightangled equicrural triangle and not because i demonstrated the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle and here it must be acknowledged that a man may consider a figure merely as triangular without attending to the particular qualities of the angles or relations of the sides so far he may abstract but this will never prove that he can frame an abstract general inconsistent idea of a triangle in like manner we may consider peter so far forth as man or so far forth as animal without framing the forementioned abstract idea either of man or of animal in as much as all that is perceived is not considered it were an endless as well as an useless thing to trace the schoolmen those great masters of abstraction through all the manifold inextricable labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of abstract natures and notions seems to have led them into what bickerings and controversies and what a learned dust have been raised about those matters and what mighty advantage hath been from thence derived to mankind are things at this day too clearly known to need being insisted on and it had been well if the ill effects of that doctrine were confined to those only who make the most avowed profession of it when men consider the great pains industry and parts that have for so many ages been laid out on the cultivation and advancement of the sciences and that notwithstanding all this the far greater part of them remain full of darkness and uncertainty and disputes that are like never to have an end and even those that are thought to be supported by the most clear and cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which are perfectly irreconcilable to the understandings of men and that taking all together a small portion of them doth supply any real benefit to mankind otherwise than by being an innocent diversion and amusement i say the consideration of all this is apt to throw them into a despondency and perfect contempt of all study but this may perhaps cease upon a view of the false principles that have obtained in the world amongst all which there is none methinks hath a more wide influence over the thoughts of speculative men than this of abstract general ideas i come now to consider the source of this prevailing notion and that seems to me to be language and surely nothing of less extent than reason it self could have been the source of an opinion so universally received the truth of this appears as from other reasons so also from the plain confession of the ablest patrons of abstract ideas who acknowledge that they are made in order to naming from which it is a clear consequence that if there had been no such thing as speech or universal signs there never had been any thought of abstraction see b sect and elsewhere of the essay on human understanding let us therefore examine the manner wherein words have contributed to the origin of that mistake first then tis thought that every name hath or ought to have one only precise and settled signification which inclines men to think there are certain abstract determinate ideas which constitute the true and only immediate signification of each general name and that it is by the mediation of these abstract ideas that a general name comes to signify any particular thing whereas in truth there is no such thing as one precise and definite signification annexed to any general name they all signifying indifferently a great number of particular ideas all which doth evidently follow from what has been already said and will clearly appear to anyone by a little reflexion to this it will be objected that every name that has a definition is thereby restrained to one certain signification for example a triangle is defined to be a plain surface comprehended by three right lines by which that name is limited to denote one certain idea and no other to which i answer that in the definition it is not said whether the surface be great or small black or white nor whether the sides are long or short equal or unequal nor with what angles they are inclined to each other in all which there may be great variety and consequently there is no one settled idea which limits the signification of the word triangle tis one thing for to keep a name constantly to the same definition and another to make it stand every where for the same idea the one is necessary the other useless and impracticable but to give a farther account how words came to produce the doctrine of abstract ideas it must be observed that it is a received opinion that language has no other end but the communicating our ideas and that every significant name stands for an idea this being so and it being withal certain that names which yet are not thought altogether insignificant do not always mark out particular conceivable ideas it is straightway concluded that they stand for abstract notions that there are many names in use amongst speculative men which do not always suggest to others determinate particular ideas is what no body will deny and a little attention will discover that it is not necessary even in the strictest reasonings significant names which stand for ideas should every time they are used excite in the understanding the ideas they are made to stand for in reading and discoursing names being for the most part used as letters are in algebra in which though a particular quantity be marked by each letter yet to proceed right it is not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to stand for besides the communicating of ideas marked by words is not the chief and only end of language as is commonly supposed there are other ends as the raising of some passion the exciting to or deterring from an action the putting the mind in some particular disposition to which the former is in many cases barely subservient and sometimes intirely omitted when these can be obtained without it as i think doth not unfrequently happen in the familiar use of language i intreat the reader to reflect with himself and see if it doth not often happen either in hearing or reading a discourse that the passions of fear love hatred admiration disdain and the like arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain words without any ideas coming between at first indeed the words might have occasioned ideas that were fit to produce those emotions but if i mistake not it will be found that when language is once grown familiar the hearing of the sounds or sight of the characters is oft immediately attended with those passions which at first were wont to be produced by the intervention of ideas that are now quite omitted may we not for example be affected with the promise of a good thing though we have not an idea of what it is or is not the being threatned with danger sufficient to excite a dread though we think not of any particular evil likely to befal us nor yet frame to our selves an idea of danger in abstract if any one shall join ever so little reflexion of his own to what has been said i believe it will evidently appear to him that general names are often used in the propriety of language without the speakers designing them for marks of ideas in his own which he would have them raise in the mind of the hearer even proper names themselves do not seem always spoken with a design to bring into our view the ideas of those individuals that are supposed to be marked by them for example when a schoolman tells me aristotle hath said it all i conceive he means by it is to dispose me to embrace his opinion with the deference and submission which custom has annexed to that name and this effect may be so instantly produced in the minds of those who are accustomed to resign their judgment to the authority of that philosopher as it is impossible any idea either of his person writings or reputation should go before innumerable examples of this kind may be given but why should i insist on those things which every ones experience will i doubt not plentifully suggest unto him we have i think shewn the impossibility of abstract ideas we have considered what has been said for them by their ablest patrons and endeavored to shew they are of no use for those ends to which they are thought necessary and lastly we have traced them to the source from whence they flow which appears to be language it cannot be denied that words are of excellent use in that by their means all that stock of knowledge which has been purchased by the joint labours of inquisitive men in all ages and nations may be drawn into the view and made the possession of one single person but at the same time it must be owned that most parts of knowledge have been strangely perplexed and darkened by the abuse of words and general ways of speech wherein they are delivered since therefore words are so apt to impose on the understanding whatever ideas i consider i shall endeavour to take them bare and naked into my view keeping out of my thoughts so far as i am able those names which long and constant use hath so strictly united with them from which i may expect to derive the following advantages first i shall be sure to get clear of all controversies purely verbal the springing up of which weeds in almost all the sciences has been a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge secondly this seems to be a sure way to extricate my self out of that fine and subtile net of abstract ideas which has so miserably perplexed and entangled the minds of men and that with this peculiar circumstance that by how much the finer and more curious was the wit of any man by so much the deeper was he like to be ensnared and faster held therein thirdly so long as i confine my thoughts to my own ideas divested of words i do not see how i can easily be mistaken the objects i consider i clearly and adequately know i cannot be deceived in thinking i have an idea which i have not it is not possible for me to imagine that any of my own ideas are alike or unlike that are not truly so to discern the agreements or disagreements there are between my ideas to see what ideas are included in any compound idea and what not there is nothing more requisite than an attentive perception of what passes in my own understanding but the attainment of all these advantages doth presuppose an intire deliverance from the deception of words which i dare hardly promise my self so difficult a thing it is to dissolve an union so early begun and confirmed by so long a habit as that betwixt words and ideas which difficulty seems to have been very much increased by the doctrine of abstraction for so long as men thought abstract ideas were annexed to their words it doth not seem strange that they should use words for ideas it being found an impracticable thing to lay aside the word and retain the abstract idea in the mind which in it self was perfectly inconceivable this seems to me the principal cause why those men who have so emphatically recommended to others the laying aside all use of words in their meditations and contemplating their bare ideas have yet failed to perform it themselves of late many have been very sensible of the absurd opinions and insignificant disputes which grow out of the abuse of words and in order to remedy these evils they advise well that we attend to the ideas signified and draw off our attention from the words which signify them but how good soever this advice may be they have given others it is plain they could not have a due regard to it themselves so long as they thought the only immediate use of words was to signify ideas and that the immediate signification of every general name was a determinate abstract idea but these being known to be mistakes a man may with greater ease prevent his being imposed on by words he that knows he has no other than particular ideas will not puzzle himself in vain to find out and conceive the abstract idea annexed to any name and he that knows names do not always stand for ideas will spare himself the labour of looking for ideas where there are none to be had it were therefore to be wished that every one would use his utmost endeavours to obtain a clear view of the ideas he would consider separating from them all that dress and incumbrance of words which so much contribute to blind the judgment and divide the attention in vain do we extend our view into the heavens and pry into the entrails of the earth in vain do we consult the writings of learned men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity we need only draw the curtain of words to behold the fairest tree of knowledge whose fruit is excellent and within the reach of our hand unless we take care to clear the first principles of knowledge from the embarras and delusion of words we may make infinite reasonings upon them to no purpose we may draw consequences from consequences and be never the wiser the farther we go we shall only lose our selves the more irrecoverably and be the deeper entangled in difficulties and mistakes whoever therefore designs to read the following sheets i intreat him to make my words the occasion of his own thinking and endeavour to attain the same train of thoughts in reading that i had in writing them by this means it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity of what i say he will be out of all danger of being deceived by my words and i do not see how he can be led into an error by considering his own naked undisguised ideas of the principles of humane knowledge part it is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of humane knowledge that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind or lastly ideas formed by help of memory and imagination either compounding dividing or barely representing those originally perceived in the aforesaid ways by sight i have the ideas of light and colours with their several degrees and variations by touch i perceive for example hard and soft heat and cold motion and resistance and of all these more and less either as to quantity or degree smelling furnishes me with odors the palate with tastes and hearing conveys sounds to the mind in all their variety of tone and composition and as several of these are observed to accompany each other they come to be marked by one name and so to be reputed as one thing thus for example a certain colour taste smell figure and consistence having been observed to go together are accounted one distinct thing signified by the name apple other collections of ideas constitute a stone a tree a book and the like sensible things which as they are pleasing or disagreeable excite the passions of love hatred joy grief and so forth but besides all that endless variety of ideas or objects of knowledge there is likewise something which knows or perceives them and exercises divers operations as willing imagining remembering about them this perceiving active being is what i call mind spirit soul or my self by which words i do not denote any one of my ideas but a thing intirely distinct from them wherein they exist or which is the same thing whereby they are perceived for the existence of an idea consists in being perceived that neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas formed by the imagination exist without the mind is what every body will allow and it seems no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense however blended or combined together that is whatever objects they compose cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them i think an intuitive knowledge may be obtained of this by any one that shall attend to what is meant by the term exist when applied to sensible things the table i write on i say exists that is i see and feel it and if i were out of my study i should say it existed meaning thereby that if i was in my study i might perceive it or that some other spirit actually does perceive it there was an odor that is it was smelled there was a sound that is to say it was heard a colour or figure and it was perceived by sight or touch this is all that i can understand by these and the like expressions for as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things without any relation to their being perceived that seems perfectly unintelligible their esse is percipi nor is it possible they should have any existence out of the minds or thinking things which perceive them it is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men that houses mountains rivers and in a word all sensible objects have an existence natural or real distinct from their being perceived by the understanding but with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertained in the world yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may if i mistake not perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction for what are the forementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these or any combination of them should exist unperceived if we thoroughly examine this tenet it will perhaps be found at bottom to depend on the doctrine of abstract ideas for can there be a nicer strain of abstraction than to distinguish the existence of sensible objects from their being perceived so as to conceive them existing unperceived light and colours heat and cold extension and figures in a word the things we see and feel what are they but so many sensations notions ideas or impressions on the sense and is it possible to separate even in thought any of these from perception for my part i might as easily divide a thing from it self i may indeed divide in my thoughts or conceive apart from each other those things which perhaps i never perceived by sense so divided thus i imagine the trunk of a humane body without the limbs or conceive the smell of a rose without thinking on the rose it self so far i will not deny i can abstract if that may properly be called abstraction which extends only to the conceiving separately such objects as it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder but my conceiving or imagining power does not extend beyond the possibility of real existence or perception hence as it is impossible for me to see or feel any thing without an actual sensation of that thing so is it impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eyes to see them such i take this important one to be to wit that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth in a word all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world have not any subsistence without a mind that their being is to be perceived or known that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me or do not exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit they must either have no existence at all or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit it being perfectly unintelligible and involving all the absurdity of abstraction to attribute to any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit to be convinced of which the reader need only reflect and try to separate in his own thoughts the being of a sensible thing from its being perceived from what has been said it follows there is not any other substance than spirit or that which perceives but for the fuller proof of this point let it be considered the sensible qualities are colour figure motion smell taste and such like that is the ideas perceived by sense now for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a manifest contradiction for to have an idea is all one as to perceive that therefore wherein colour figure and the like qualities exist must perceive them hence it is clear there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas but say you though the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind yet there may be things like them whereof they are copies or resemblances which things exist without the mind in an unthinking substance i answer an idea can be like nothing but an idea a colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure if we look but ever so little into our thoughts we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a likeness except only between our ideas again i ask whether those supposed originals or external things of which our ideas are the pictures or representations be themselves perceivable or no if they are then they are ideas and we have gained our point but if you say they are not i appeal to any one whether it be sense to assert a colour is like something which is invisible hard or soft like something which is intangible and so of the rest some there are who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities by the former they mean extension figure motion rest solidity or impenetrability and number by the latter they denote all other sensible qualities as colours sounds tastes and so forth the ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of any thing existing without the mind or unperceived but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be patterns or images of things which exist without the mind in an unthinking substance which they call matter by matter therefore we are to understand an inert senseless substance in which extension figure and motion do actually subsist but it is evident from what we have already shewn that extension figure and motion are only ideas existing in the mind and that an idea can be like nothing but another idea and that consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance hence it is plain that that the very notion of what is called matter or corporeal substance involves a contradiction in it they who assert that figure motion and the rest of the primary or original qualities do exist without the mind in unthinking substances do at the same time acknowledge that colours sounds heat cold and suchlike secondary qualities do not which they tell us are sensations existing in the mind alone that depend on and are occasioned by the different size texture and motion of the minute particles of matter this they take for an undoubted truth which they can demonstrate beyond all exception now if it be certain that those original qualities are inseparably united with the other sensible qualities and not even in thought capable of being abstracted from them it plainly follows that they exist only in the mind but i desire any one to reflect and try whether he can by any abstraction of thought conceive the extension and motion of a body without all other sensible qualities for my own part i see evidently that it is not in my power to frame an idea of a body extended and moved but i must withal give it some colour or other sensible quality which is acknowledged to exist only in the mind in short extension figure and motion abstracted from all other qualities are inconceivable where therefore the other sensible qualities are there must these be also to wit in the mind and no where else again great and small swift and slow are allowed to exist no where without the mind being intirely relative and changing as the frame or position of the organs of sense varies the extension therefore which exists without the mind is neither great nor small the motion neither swift nor slow that is they are nothing at all but say you they are extension in general and motion in general thus we see how much the tenet of extended moveable substances existing without the mind depends on that strange doctrine of abstract ideas and here i cannot but remark how nearly the vague and indeterminate description of matter or corporeal substance which the modern philosophers are run into by their own principles resembles that antiquated and so much ridiculed notion of materia prima to be met with in aristotle and his followers without extension solidity cannot be conceived since therefore it has been shewn that extension exists not in an unthinking substance the same must also be true of solidity that number is intirely the creature of the mind even though the other qualities be allowed to exist without will be evident to whoever considers that the same thing bears a different denomination of number as the mind views it with different respects thus the same extension is one or three or thirty six according as the mind considers it with reference to a yard a foot or an inch number is so visibly relative and dependent on mens understanding that it is strange to think how any one should give it an absolute existence without the mind we say one book one page one line all these are equally unites though some contain several of the others and in each instance it is plain the unite relates to some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put together by the mind unity i know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded idea accompanying all other ideas into the mind that i have any such idea answering the word unity i do not find and if i had methinks i could not miss finding it on the contrary it should be the most familiar to my understanding since it is said to accompany all other ideas and to be perceived by all the ways of sensation and reflexion to say no more it is an abstract idea i shall farther add that after the same manner as modern philosophers prove certain sensible qualities to have no existence in matter or without the mind the same thing may be likewise proved of all other sensible qualities whatsoever thus for instance it is said that heat and cold are affections only of the mind and not at all patterns of real beings existing in the corporeal substances which excite them for that the same body which appears cold to one hand seems warm to another now why may we not as well argue that figure and extension are not patterns or resemblances of qualities existing in matter because to the same eye at different stations or eyes of a different texture at the same station they appear various and cannot therefore be the images of any thing settled and determinate without the mind again it is proved that sweetness is not really in the sapid thing because the thing remaining unaltered the sweetness is changed into bitter as in case of a fever or otherwise vitiated palate is it not as reasonable to say that motion is not without the mind since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter the motion it is acknowledged shall appear slower without any alteration in any external object in short let any one consider those arguments which are thought manifestly to prove that colours and tastes exist only in the mind and he shall find they may with equal force be brought to prove the same thing of extension figure and motion though it must be confessed this method of arguing doth not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in an outward object as that we do not know by sense which is the true extension or colour of the object but the arguments foregoing plainly shew it to be impossible that any colour or extension at all or other sensible quality whatsoever should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind or in truth that there should be any such thing as an outward object but let us examine a little the received opinion it is said extension is a mode or accident of matter and that matter is the substratum that supports it now i desire that you would explain what is meant by matters supporting extension say you i have no idea of matter and therefore cannot explain it i answer though you have no positive yet if you have any meaning at all you must at least have a relative idea of matter though you know not what it is yet you must be supposed to know what relation it bears to accidents and what is meant by its supporting them it is evident support cannot here be taken in its usual or literal sense as when we say that pillars support a building in what sense therefore must it be taken if we inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare themselves to mean by material substance we shall find them acknowledge they have no other meaning annexed to those sounds but the idea of being in general together with the relative notion of its supporting accidents the general idea of being appeareth to me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other and as for its supporting accidents this as we have just now observed cannot be understood in the common sense of those words it must therefore be taken in some other sense but what that is they do not explain so that when i consider the two parts or branches which make the signification of the words material substance i am convinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them but why should we trouble our selves any farther in discussing this material substratum or support of figure and motion and other sensible qualities does it not suppose they have an existence without the mind and is not this a direct repugnancy and altogether inconceivable but though it were possible that solid figured moveable substances may exist without the mind corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies yet how is it possible for us to know this either we must know it by sense or by reason as for our senses by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations ideas or those things that are immediately perceived by sense call them what you will but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind or unperceived like to those which are perceived this the materialists themselves acknowledge it remains therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things it must be by reason inferring their existence from what is immediately perceived by sense but what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind from what we perceive since the very patrons of matter themselves do not pretend there is any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas i say it is granted on all hands and what happens in dreams phrensies and the like puts it beyond dispute that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have now though no bodies existed without resembling them hence it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas since it is granted they are produced sometimes and might possibly be produced always in the same order we see them in at present without their concurrence but though we might possibly have all our sensations without them yet perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production by supposing external bodies in their likeness rather than otherwise and so it might be at least probable there are such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds but neither can this be said for though we give the materialists their external bodies they by their own confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas are produced since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit or how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the mind hence it is evident the production of ideas or sensations in our minds can be no reason why we should suppose matter or corporeal substances since that is acknowledged to remain equally inexplicable with or without this supposition if therefore it were possible for bodies to exist without the mind yet to hold they do so must needs be a very precarious opinion since it is to suppose without any reason at all that god has created innumerable beings that are intirely useless and serve to no manner of purpose in short if there were external bodies it is impossible we should ever come to know it and if there were not we might have the very same reasons to think there were that we have now suppose what no one can deny possible an intelligence without the help of external bodies to be affected with the same train of sensations or ideas that you are imprinted in the same order and with like vividness in his mind i ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances represented by his ideas and exciting them in his mind that you can possibly have for believing the same thing of this there can be no question which one consideration is enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever arguments be may think himself to have for the existence of bodies without the mind were it necessary to add any farther proof against the existence of matter after what has been said i could instance several of those errors and difficulties not to mention impieties which have sprung from that tenet it has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in philosophy and not a few of far greater moment in religion but i shall not enter into the detail of them in this place as well because i think arguments a posteriori are unnecessary for confirming what has been if i mistake not sufficiently demonstrated a priori as because i shall hereafter find occasion to say somewhat of them i am afraid i have given cause to think me needlesly prolix in handling this subject for to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two to any one that is capable of the least reflexion it is but looking into your own thoughts and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound or figure or motion or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived this easy trial may make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction insomuch that i am content to put the whole upon this issue if you can but conceive it possible for one extended moveable substance or in general for any one idea or any thing like an idea to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it i shall readily give up the cause and as for all that compages of external bodies which you contend for i shall grant you its existence though you cannot either give me any reason why you believe it exists or assign any use to it when it is supposed to exist i say the bare possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that it is so but say you surely there is nothing easier than to imagine trees for instance in a park or books existing in a closet and no body by to perceive them i answer you may so there is no difficulty in it but what is all this i beseech you more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call books and trees and the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them but do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while this therefore is nothing to the purpose it only shews you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind to make out this it is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceived or unthought of which is a manifest repugnancy when we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas but the mind taking no notice of it self is deluded to think it can and doth conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind though at the same time they are apprehended by or exist in it self a little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of material substance it is very obvious upon the least inquiry into our own thoughts to know whether it be possible for us to understand what is meant by the absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves or without the mind to me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction or else nothing at all and to convince others of this i know no readier or fairer way than to intreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions does appear surely nothing more is requisite for their conviction it is on this therefore that i insist to wit that the absolute existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning or which include a contradiction this is what i repeat and inculcate and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader all our ideas sensations or the things which we perceive by whatsoever names they may be distinguished are visibly inactive there is nothing of power or agency included in them so that one idea or object of thought cannot produce or make any alteration in another to be satisfied of the truth of this there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas for since they and every part of them exist only in the mind it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived but whoever shall attend to his ideas whether of sense or reflexion will not perceive in them any power or activity there is therefore no such thing contained in them a little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do any thing or strictly speaking to be the cause of any thing neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being as is evident from sect whence it plainly follows that extension figure and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations to say therefore that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration number motion and size of corpuscles must certainly be false we perceive a continual succession of ideas some are anew excited others are changed or totally disappear there is therefore some cause of these ideas whereon they depend and which produces and changes them that this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of ideas is clear from the preceding section it must therefore be a substance but it has been shewn that there is no corporeal or material substance it remains therefore that the cause of ideas is an incorporeal active substance or spirit a spirit is one simple undivided active being as it perceives ideas it is called the understanding and as it produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the will hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit for all ideas whatever being passive and inert vide sect they cannot represent unto us by way of image or likeness that which acts a little attention will make it plain to any one that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible such is the nature of spirit or that which acts that it cannot be of it self perceived but only by the effects which it produceth if any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active being and whether he hath ideas of two principal powers marked by the names will and understanding distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of substance or being in general with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid powers which is signified by the name soul or spirit this is what some hold but so far as i can see the words will soul spirit do not stand for different ideas or in truth for any idea at all but for something which is very different from ideas and which being an agent cannot be like unto or represented by any idea whatsoever though it must be owned at the same time that we have some notion of soul spirit and the operations of the mind such as willing loving hating in as much as we know or understand the meaning of those words i find i can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure and vary and shift the scene as oft as i think fit it is no more than willing and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another this making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active thus much is certain and grounded on experience but when we think of unthinking agents or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition we only amuse our selves with words but whatever power i may have over my own thoughts i find the ideas actually perceived by sense have not a like dependence on my will when in broad daylight i open my eyes it is not in my power to choose whether i shall see or no or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will there is therefore some other will or spirit that produces them the ideas of sense are more strong lively and distinct than those of the imagination they have likewise a steddiness order and coherence and are not excited at random as those which are the effects of humane wills often are but in a regular train or series the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its author now the set rules or established methods wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the ideas of sense are called the laws of nature and these we learn by experience which teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas in the ordinary course of things this gives us a sort of foresight which enables us to regulate our actions for the benefit of life and without this we should be eternally at a loss we could not know how to act any thing that might procure us the least pleasure or remove the least pain of sense that food nourishes sleep refreshes and fire warms us that to sow in the seedtime is the way to reap in the harvest and in general that to obtain such or such ends such or such means are conducive all this we know not by discovering any necessary connexion between our ideas but only by the observation of the settled laws of nature without which we should be all in uncertainty and confusion and a grown man no more know how to manage himself in the affairs of life than an infant just born and yet this consistent uniform working which so evidently displays the goodness and wisdom of that governing spirit whose will constitutes the laws of nature is so far from leading our thoughts to him that it rather sends them a wandering after second causes for when we perceive certain ideas of sense constantly followed by other ideas and we know this is not of our own doing we forthwith attribute power and agency to the ideas themselves and make one the cause of another than which nothing can be more absurd and unintelligible thus for example having observed that when we perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure we at the same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation called heat we do from thence conclude the sun to be the cause of heat and in like manner perceiving the motion and collision of bodies to be attended with sound we are inclined to think the latter an effect of the former the ideas imprinted on the senses by the author of nature are called real things and those excited in the imagination being less regular vivid and constant are more properly termed ideas or images of things which they copy and represent but then our sensations be they never so vivid and distinct are nevertheless ideas that is they exist in the mind or are perceived by it as truly as the ideas of its own framing the ideas of sense are allowed to have more reality in them that is to be more strong orderly and coherent than the creatures of the mind but this is no argument that they exist without the mind they are also less dependent on the spirit or thinking substance which perceives them in that they are excited by the will of another and more powerful spirit yet still they are ideas and certainly no idea whether faint or strong can exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it before we proceed any farther it is necessary to spend some time in answering objections which may probably be made against the principles hitherto laid down in doing of which if i seem too prolix to those of quick apprehensions i hope it may be pardoned since all men do not equally apprehend things of this nature and i am willing to be understood by every one first then it will be objected that by the foregoing principles all that is real and substantial in nature is banished out of the world and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas takes place all things that exist exist only in the mind that is they are purely notional what therefore becomes of the sun moon and stars what must we think of houses rivers mountains trees stones nay even of our own bodies are all these but so many chimeras and illusions on the fancy to all which and whatever else of the same sort may be objected i answer that by the principles premised we are not deprived of any one thing in nature whatever we see feel hear or any wise conceive or understand remains as secure as ever and is as real as ever there is a rerum natura and the distinction between realities and chimeras retains its full force this is evident from sect and where we have shewn what is meant by real things in opposition to chimeras or ideas of our own framing but then they both equally exist in the mind and in that sense they are alike ideas i do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend either by sense or reflexion that the things i see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist really exist i make not the least question the only thing whose existence we deny is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance and in doing of this there is no damage done to the rest of mankind who i dare say will never miss it the atheist indeed will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety and the philosophers may possibly find they have lost a great handle for trifling and disputation if any man thinks this detracts from the existence or reality of things he is very far from understanding what hath been premised in the plainest terms i could think of take here an abstract of what has been said there are spiritual substances minds or humane souls which will or excite ideas in themselves at pleasure but these are faint weak and unsteady in respect of others they perceive by sense which being impressed upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature speak themselves the effects of a mind more powerful and wise than humane spirits these latter are said to have more reality in them than the former by which is meant that they are more affecting orderly and distinct and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them and in this sense the sun that i see by day is the real sun and that which i imagine by night is the idea of the former in the sense here given of reality it is evident that every vegetable star mineral and in general each part of the mundane system is as much a real being by our principles as by any other whether others mean any thing by the term reality different from what i do i intreat them to look into their own thoughts and see it will be urged that thus much at least is true to wit that we take away all corporeal substances to this my answer is that if the word substance be taken in the vulgar sense for a combination of sensible qualities such as extension solidity weight and the like this we cannot be accused of taking away but if it be taken in a philosophic sense for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind then indeed i acknowledge that we take it away if one may be said to take away that which never had any existence not even in the imagination but say you it sounds very harsh to say we eat and drink ideas and are clothed with ideas i acknowledge it does so the word idea not being used in common discourse to signify the several combinations of sensible qualities which are called things and it is certain that any expression which varies from the familiar use of language will seem harsh and ridiculous but this doth not concern the truth of the proposition which in other words is no more than to say we are fed and clothed with those things which we perceive immediately by our senses the hardness or softness the colour taste warmth figure and such like qualities which combined together constitute the several sorts of victuals and apparel have been shewn to exist only in the mind that perceives them and this is all that is meant by calling them ideas which word if it was as ordinarily used as thing would sound no harsher nor more ridiculous than it i am not for disputing about the propriety but the truth of the expression if therefore you agree with me that we eat and drink and are clad with the immediate objects of sense which cannot exist unperceived or without the mind i shall readily grant it is more proper or conformable to custom that they should be called things rather than ideas if it be demanded why i make use of the word idea and do not rather in compliance with custom call them things i answer i do it for two reasons first because the term thing in contradistinction to idea is generally supposed to denote somewhat existing without the mind secondly because thing hath a more comprehensive signification than idea including spirits or thinking things as well as ideas since therefore the objects of sense exist only in the mind and are withal thoughtless and inactive i chose to mark them by the word idea which implies those properties but say what we can some one perhaps may be apt to reply he will still believe his senses and never suffer any arguments how plausible soever to prevail over the certainty of them be it so assert the evidence of sense as high as you please we are willing to do the same that what i see hear and feel doth exist that is to say is perceived by me i no more doubt than i do of my own being but i do not see how the testimony of sense can be alledged as a proof for the existence of any thing which is not perceived by sense we are not for having any man turn sceptic and disbelieve his senses on the contrary we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable nor are there any principles more opposite to scepticism than those we have laid down as shall be hereafter clearly shewn secondly it will be objected that there is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance and the idea of fire betwixt dreaming or imagining ones self burnt and actually being so this and the like may be urged in opposition to our tenets to all which the answer is evident from what hath been already said and i shall only add in this place that if real fire be very different from the idea of fire so also is the real pain that it occasions very different from the idea of the same pain and yet no body will pretend that real pain either is or can possibly be in an unperceiving thing or without the mind any more than its idea thirdly it will be objected that we see things actually without or at distance from us and which consequently do not exist in the mind it being absurd that those things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts in answer to this i desire it may be considered that in a dream we do oft perceive things as existing at a great distance off and yet for all that those things are acknowledged to have their existence only in the mind but for the fuller clearing of this point it may be worth while to consider how it is that we perceive distance and things placed at a distance by sight for that we should in truth see external space and bodies actually existing in it some nearer others farther off seems to carry with it some opposition to what hath been said of their existing no where without the mind the consideration of this difficulty it was that gave birth to my essay towards a new theory of vision which was published not long since wherein it is shewn that distance or outness is neither immediately of it self perceived by sight nor yet apprehended or judged of by lines and angles or any thing that hath a necessary connexion with it but that it is only suggested to our thoughts by certain visible ideas and sensations attending vision which in their own nature have no manner of similitude or relation either with distance or things placed at a distance but by a connexion taught us by experience they come to signify and suggest them to us after the same manner that words of any language suggest the ideas they are made to stand for insomuch that a man born blind and afterwards made to see would not at first sight think the things he saw to be without his mind or at any distance from him see sect of the forementioned treatise the ideas of sight and touch make two species intirely distinct and heterogeneous the former are marks and prognostics of the latter that the proper objects of sight neither exist without the mind nor are the images of external things was shewn even in that treatise though throughout the same the contrary be supposed true of tangible objects not that to suppose that vulgar error was necessary for establishing the notion therein laid down but because it was beside my purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concerning vision so that in strict truth the ideas of sight when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time and in consequence of such or such actions it is i say evident from what has been said in the foregoing parts of this treatise and in sect and elsewhere of the essay concerning vision that visible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit on whom we depend informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies but for a fuller information in this point i refer to the essay it self fourthly it will be objected that from the foregoing principles it follows things are every moment annihilated and created anew the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived the trees therefore are in the garden or the chairs in the parlour no longer than while there is some body by to perceive them upon shutting my eyes all the furniture in the room is reduced to nothing and barely upon opening them it is again created in answer to all which i refer the reader to what has been said in sect c and desire he will consider whether he means any thing by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its being perceived for my part after the nicest inquiry i could make i am not able to discover that any thing else is meant by those words and i once more intreat the reader to sound his own thoughts and not suffer himself to be imposed on by words if he can conceive it possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without being perceived then i give up the cause but if he cannot he will acknowledge it is unreasonable for him to stand up in defence of he knows not what and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity the not assenting to those propositions which at bottom have no meaning in them it will not be amiss to observe how far the received principles of philosophy are themselves chargeable with those pretended absurdities it is thought strangely absurd that upon closing my eyelids all the visible objects round me should be reduced to nothing and yet is not this what philosophers commonly acknowledge when they agree on all hands that light and colours which alone are the proper and immediate objects of sight are mere sensations that exist no longer than they are perceived again it may to some perhaps seem very incredible that things should be every moment creating yet this very notion is commonly taught in the schools for the schoolmen though they acknowledge the existence of matter and that the whole mundane fabrick is framed out of it are nevertheless of opinion that it cannot subsist without the divine conservation which by them is expounded to be a continual creation farther a little thought will discover to us that though we allow the existence of matter or corporeal substance yet it will unavoidably follow from the principles which are now generally admitted that the particular bodies of what kind soever do none of them exist whilst they are not perceived for it is evident from sect and the following sections that the matter philosophers contend for is an incomprehensible somewhat which hath none of those particular qualities whereby the bodies falling under our senses are distinguished one from another but to make this more plain it must be remarked that the infinite divisibility of matter is now universally allowed at least by the most approved and considerable philosophers who on the received principles demonstrate it beyond all exception hence it follows that there is an infinite number of parts in each particle of matter which are not perceived by sense the reason therefore that any particular body seems to be of a finite magnitude or exhibits only a finite number of parts to sense is not because it contains no more since in itself it contains an infinite number of parts but because the sense is not acute enough to discern them in proportion therefore as the sense is rendered more acute it perceives a greater number of parts in the object that is the object appears greater and its figure varies those parts in its extremities which were before unperceivable appearing now to bound it in very different lines and angles from those perceived by an obtuser sense and at length after various changes of size and shape when the sense becomes infinitely acute the body shall seem infinite during all which there is no alteration in the body but only in the sense each body therefore considered in it self is infinitely extended and consequently void of all shape or figure from which it follows that though we should grant the existence of matter to be ever so certain yet it is withal as certain the materialists themselves are by their own principles forced to acknowledge that neither the particular bodies perceived by sense nor any thing like them exists without the mind matter i say and each particle thereof is according to them infinite and shapeless and it is the mind that frames all that variety of bodies which compose the visible world any one whereof does not exist longer than it is perceived if we consider it the objection proposed in sect will not be found reasonably charged on the principles we have premised so as in truth to make any objection at all against our notions for though we hold indeed the objects of sense to be nothing else but ideas which cannot exist unperceived yet we may not hence conclude they have no existence except only while they are perceived by us since there may be some other spirit that perceives them though we do not wherever bodies are said to have no existence without the mind i would not be understood to mean this or that particular mind but all minds whatsoever it does not therefore follow from the foregoing principles that bodies are annihilated and created every moment or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception of them fifthly it may perhaps be objected that if extension and figure exist only in the mind it follows that the mind is extended and figured since extension is a mode or attribute which to speak with the schools is predicated of the subject in which it exists i answer those qualities are in the mind only as they are perceived by it that is not by way of mode or attribute but only by way of idea and it no more follows that the soul or mind is extended because extension exists in it alone than it does that it is red or blue because those colours are on all hands acknowledged to exist in it and no where else as to what philosophers say of subject and mode that seems very groundless and unintelligible for instance in this proposition a die is hard extended and square they will have it that the word die denotes a subject or substance distinct from the hardness extension and figure which are predicated of it and in which they exist this i cannot comprehend to me a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things which are termed its modes or accidents and to say a die is hard extended and square is not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and supporting them but only an explication of the meaning of the word die sixthly you will say there have been a great many things explained by matter and motion take away these and you destroy the whole corpuscular philosophy and undermine those mechanical principles which have been applied with so much success to account for the phænomena in short whatever advances have been made either by ancient or modern philosophers in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition that corporeal substance or matter doth really exist to this i answer that there is not any one phænomenon explained on that supposition which may not as well be explained without it as might easily be made appear by an induction of particulars to explain the phænomena is all one as to shew why upon such and such occasions we are affected with such and such ideas but how matter should operate on a spirit or produce any idea in it is what no philosopher will pretend to explain it is therefore evident there can be no use of matter in natural philosophy besides they who attempt to account for things do it not by corporeal substance but by figure motion and other qualities which are in truth no more than mere ideas and therefore cannot be the cause of any thing as hath been already shewn see sect seventhly it will upon this be demanded whether it does not seem absurd to take away natural causes and ascribe every thing to the immediate operation of spirits we must no longer say upon these principles that fire heats or water cools but that a spirit heats and so forth would not a man be deservedly laught at who should talk after this manner i answer he would so in such things we ought to think with the learned and speak with the vulgar they who to demonstration are convinced of the truth of the copernican system do nevertheless say the sun rises the sun sets or comes to the meridian and if they affected a contrary stile in common talk it would without doubt appear very ridiculous a little reflexion on what is here said will make it manifest that the common use of language would receive no manner of alteration or disturbance from the admission of our tenets in the ordinary affairs of life any phrases may be retained so long as they excite in us proper sentiments or dispositions to act in such a manner as is necessary for our wellbeing how false soever they may be if taken in a strict and speculative sense nay this is unavoidable since propriety being regulated by custom language is suited to the received opinions which are not always the truest hence it is impossible even in the most rigid philosophic reasonings so far to alter the bent and genius of the tongue we speak as never to give a handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsistencies but a fair and ingenuous reader will collect the sense from the scope and tenor and connexion of a discourse making allowances for those inaccurate modes of speech which use has made inevitable as to the opinion that there are no corporeal causes this has been heretofore maintained by some of the schoolmen as it is of late by others among the modern philosophers who though they allow matter to exist yet will have god alone to be the immediate efficient cause of all things these men saw that amongst all the objects of sense there was none which had any power or activity included in it and that by consequence this was likewise true of whatever bodies they supposed to exist without the mind like unto the immediate objects of sense but then that they should suppose an innumerable multitude of created beings which they acknowledge are not capable of producing any one effect in nature and which therefore are made to no manner of purpose since god might have done every thing as well without them this i say though we should allow it possible must yet be a very unaccountable and extravagant supposition in the eighth place the universal concurrent assent of mankind may be thought by some an invincible argument in behalf of matter or the existence of external things must we suppose the whole world to be mistaken and if so what cause can be assigned of so widespread and predominant an error i answer first that upon a narrow inquiry it will not perhaps be found so many as is imagined do really believe the existence of matter or things without the mind strictly speaking to believe that which involves a contradiction or has no meaning in it is impossible and whether the foregoing expressions are not of that sort i refer it to the impartial examination of the reader in one sense indeed men may be said to believe that matter exists that is they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations which affects them every moment and is so nearly present to them were some senseless unthinking being but that they should clearly apprehend any meaning marked by those words and form thereof a settled speculative opinion is what i am not able to conceive this is not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves by imagining they believe those propositions they have often heard though at bottom they have no meaning in them but secondly though we should grant a notion to be ever so universally and stedfastly adhered to yet this is but a weak argument of its truth to whoever considers what a vast number of prejudices and false opinions are every where embraced with the utmost tenaciousness by the unreflecting which are the far greater part of mankind there was a time when the antipodes and motion of the earth were looked upon as monstrous absurdities even by men of learning and if it be considered what a small proportion they bear to the rest of mankind we shall find that at this day those notions have gained but a very inconsiderable footing in the world but it is demanded that we assign a cause of this prejudice and account for its obtaining in the world to this i answer that men knowing they perceived several ideas whereof they themselves were not the authors as not being excited from within nor depending on the operation of their wills this made them maintain those ideas or objects of perception had an existence independent of and without the mind without ever dreaming that a contradiction was involved in those words but philosophers having plainly seen that the immediate objects of perception do not exist without the mind they in some degree corrected the mistake of the vulgar but at the same time run into another which seems no less absurd to wit that there are certain objects really existing without the mind or having a subsistence distinct from being perceived of which our ideas are only images or resemblances imprinted by those objects on the mind and this notion of the philosophers owes its origin to the same cause with the former namely their being conscious that they were not the authors of their own sensations which they evidently knew were imprinted from without and which therefore must have some cause distinct from the minds on which they are imprinted but why they should suppose the ideas of sense to be excited in us by things in their likeness and not rather have recourse to spirit which alone can act may be accounted for first because they were not aware of the repugnancy there is as well in supposing things like unto our ideas existing without as in attributing to them power or activity secondly because the supreme spirit which excites those ideas in our minds is not marked out and limited to our view by any particular finite collection of sensible ideas as humane agents are by their size complexion limbs and motions and thirdly because his operations are regular and uniform whenever the course of nature is interrupted by a miracle men are ready to own the presence of a superior agent but when we see things go on in the ordinary course they do not excite in us any reflexion their order and concatenation though it be an argument of the greatest wisdom power and goodness in their creator is yet so constant and familiar to us that we do not think them the immediate effects of a free spirit especially since inconstancy and mutability in acting though it be an imperfection is looked on as a mark of freedom tenthly it will be objected that the notions we advance are inconsistent with several sound truths in philosophy and mathematicks for example the motion of the earth is now universally admitted by astronomers as a truth grounded on the clearest and most convincing reasons but on the foregoing principles there can be no such thing for motion being only an idea it follows that if it be not perceived it exists not but the motion of the earth is not perceived by sense i answer that tenet if rightly understood will be found to agree with the principles we have premised for the question whether the earth moves or no amounts in reality to no more than this to wit whether we have reason to conclude from what hath been observed by astronomers that if we were placed in such and such circumstances and such or such a position and distance both from the earth and sun we should perceive the former to move among the choir of the planets and appearing in all respects like one of them and this by the established rules of nature which we have no reason to mistrust is reasonably collected from the phænomena we may from the experience we have had of the train and succession of ideas in our minds often make i will not say uncertain conjectures but sure and wellgrounded predictions concerning the ideas we shall be affected with pursuant to a great train of actions and be enabled to pass a right judgment of what would have appeared to us in case we were placed in circumstances very different from those we are in at present herein consists the knowledge of nature which may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath been said it will be easy to apply this to whatever objections of the like sort may be drawn from the magnitude of the stars or any other discoveries in astronomy or nature in the eleventh place it will be demanded to what purpose serves that curious organization of plants and the admirable mechanism in the parts of animals might not vegetables grow and shoot forth leaves and blossoms and animals perform all their motions as well without as with all that variety of internal parts so elegantly contrived and put together which being ideas have nothing powerful or operative in them nor have any necessary connexion with the effects ascribed to them if it be a spirit that immediately produces every effect by a fiat or act of his will we must think all that is fine and artificial in the works whether of man or nature to be made in vain by this doctrine though an artist hath made the spring and wheels and every movement of a watch and adjusted them in such a manner as he knew would produce the motions he designed yet he must think all this done to no purpose and that it is an intelligence which directs the index and points to the hour of the day if so why may not the intelligence do it without his being at the pains of making the movements and putting them together why does not an empty case serve as well as another and how comes it to pass that whenever there is any fault in the going of a watch there is some corresponding disorder to be found in the movements which being mended by a skilful hand all is right again the like may be said of all the clockwork of nature great part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtile as scarce to be discerned by the best microscope in short it will be asked how upon our principles any tolerable account can be given or any final cause assigned of an innumerable multitude of bodies and machines framed with the most exquisite art which in the common philosophy have very apposite uses assigned them and serve to explain abundance of phænomena to all which i answer first that though there were some difficulties relating to the administration of providence and the uses by it assigned to the several parts of nature which i could not solve by the foregoing principles yet this objection could be of small weight against the truth and certainty of those things which may be proved a priori with the utmost evidence secondly but neither are the received principles free from the like difficulties for it may still be demanded to what end god should take those roundabout methods of effecting things by instruments and machines which no one can deny might have been effected by the mere command of his will without all that apparatus nay if we narrowly consider it we shall find the objection may be retorted with greater force on those who hold the existence of those machines without the mind for it has been made evident that solidity bulk figure motion and the like have no activity or efficacy in them so as to be capable of producing any one effect in nature see sect whoever therefore supposes them to exist allowing the supposition possible when they are not perceived does it manifestly to no purpose since the only use that is assigned to them as they exist unperceived is that they produce those perceivable effects which in truth cannot be ascribed to any thing but spirit but to come nearer the difficulty it must be observed that though the fabrication of all those parts and organs be not absolutely necessary to the producing any effect yet it is necessary to the producing of things in a constant regular way according to the laws of nature there are certain general laws that run through the whole chain of natural effects these are learned by the observation and study of nature and are by men applied as well to the framing artificial things for the use and ornament of life as to the explaining the various phænomena which explication consists only in shewing the conformity any particular phænomenon hath to the general laws of nature or which is the same thing in discovering the uniformity there is in the production of natural effects as will be evident to whoever shall attend to the several instances wherein philosophers pretend to account for appearances that there is a great and conspicuous use in these regular constant methods of working observed by the supreme agent hath been shewn in sect and it is no less visible that a particular size figure motion and disposition of parts are necessary though not absolutely to the producing any effect yet to the producing it according to the standing mechanical laws of nature thus for instance it cannot be denied that god or the intelligence which sustains and rules the ordinary course of things might if he were minded to produce a miracle cause all the motions on the dialplate of a watch though no body had ever made the movements and put them in it but yet if he will act agreeably to the rules of mechanism by him for wise ends established and maintained in the creation it is necessary that those actions of the watchmaker whereby he makes the movements and rightly adjusts them precede the production of the aforesaid motions as also that any disorder in them be attended with the perception of some corresponding disorder in the movements which being once corrected all is right again it may indeed on some occasions be necessary that the author of nature display his overruling power in producing some appearance out of the ordinary series of things such exceptions from the general rules of nature are proper to surprise and awe men into an acknowledgment of the divine being but then they are to be used but seldom otherwise there is a plain reason why they should fail of that effect besides god seems to choose the convincing our reason of his attributes by the works of nature which discover so much harmony and contrivance in their make and are such plain indications of wisdom and beneficence in their author rather than to astonish us into a belief of his being by anomalous and surprising events to set this matter in a yet clearer light i shall observe that what has been objected in sect amounts in reality to no more than this ideas are not any how and at random produced there being a certain order and connexion between them like to that of cause and effect there are also several combinations of them made in a very regular and artificial manner which seem like so many instruments in the hand of nature that being hid as it were behind the scenes have a secret operation in producing those appearances which are seen on the theatre of the world being themselves discernible only to the curious eye of the philosopher but since one idea cannot be the cause of another to what purpose is that connexion and since those instruments being barely inefficacious perceptions in the mind are not subservient to the production of natural effects it is demanded why they are made or in other words what reason can be assigned why god should make us upon a close inspection into his works behold so great variety of ideas so artfully laid together and so much according to rule it not being credible that he would be at the expense if one may so speak of all that art and regularity to no purpose to all which my answer is first that the connexion of ideas does not imply the relation of cause and effect but only of a mark or sign with the thing signified the fire which i see is not the cause of the pain i suffer upon my approaching it but the mark that forewarns me of it in like manner the noise that i hear is not the effect of this or that motion or collision of the ambient bodies but the sign thereof secondly the reason why ideas are formed into machines that is artificial and regular combinations is the same with that for combining letters into words that a few original ideas may be made to signify a great number of effects and actions it is necessary they be variously combined together and to the end their use be permanent and universal these combinations must be made by rule and with wise contrivance by this means abundance of information is conveyed unto us concerning what we are to expect from such and such actions and what methods are proper to be taken for the exciting such and such ideas which in effect is all that i conceive to be distinctly meant when it is said that by discerning the figure texture and mechanism of the inward parts of bodies whether natural or artificial we may attain to know the several uses and properties depending thereon or the nature of the thing hence it is evident that those things which under the notion of a cause cooperating or concurring to the production of effects are altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities may be very naturally explained and have a proper and obvious use assigned them when they are considered only as marks or signs for our information and it is the searching after and endeavouring to understand those signs instituted by the author of nature that ought to be the employment of the natural philosopher and not the pretending to explain things by corporeal causes which doctrine seems to have too much estranged the minds of men from that active principle that supreme and wise spirit in whom we live move and have our being in the twelfth place it may perhaps be objected that though it be clear from what has been said that there can be no such thing as an inert senseless extended solid figured moveable substance existing without the mind such as philosophers describe matter yet if any man shall leave out of his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension figure solidity and motion and say that he means only by that word an inert senseless substance that exists without the mind or unperceived which is the occasion of our ideas or at the presence whereof god is pleased to excite ideas in us it doth not appear but that matter taken in this sense may possibly exist in answer to which i say first that it seems no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents than it is to suppose accidents without a substance but secondly though we should grant this unknown substance may possibly exist yet where can it be supposed to be that it exists not in the mind is agreed and that it exists not in place is no less certain since all extension exists only in the mind as hath been already proved it remains therefore that it exists no where at all let us examine a little the description that is here given us of matter it neither acts nor perceives nor is perceived for this is all that is meant by saying it is an inert senseless unknown substance which is a definition intirely made up of negatives excepting only the relative notion of its standing under or supporting but then it must be observed that it supports nothing at all and how nearly this comes to the description of a nonentity i desire may be considered but say you it is the unknown occasion at the presence of which ideas are excited in us by the will of god now i would fain know how any thing can be present to us which is neither perceivable by sense nor reflexion nor capable of producing any idea in our minds nor is at all extended nor hath any form nor exists in any place the words to be present when thus applied must needs be taken in some abstract and strange meaning and which i am not able to comprehend again let us examine what is meant by occasion so far as i can gather from the common use of language that word signifies either the agent which produces any effect or else something that is observed to accompany or go before it in the ordinary course of things but when it is applied to matter as above described it can be taken in neither of those senses for matter is said to be passive and inert and so cannot be an agent or efficient cause it is also unperceivable as being devoid of all sensible qualities and so cannot be the occasion of our perceptions in the latter sense as when the burning my finger is said to be the occasion of the pain that attends it what therefore can be meant by calling matter an occasion this term is either used in no sense at all or else in some sense very distant from its received signification you will perhaps say that matter though it be not perceived by us is nevertheless perceived by god to whom it is the occasion of exciting ideas in our minds for say you since we observe our sensations to be imprinted in an orderly and constant manner it is but reasonable to suppose there are certain constant and regular occasions of their being produced that is to say that there are certain permanent and distinct parcels of matter corresponding to our ideas which though they do not excite them in our minds or any ways immediately affect us as being altogether passive and unperceivable to us they are nevertheless to god by whom they are perceived as it were so many occasions to remind him when and what ideas to imprint on our minds that so things may go on in a constant uniform manner in answer to this i observe that as the notion of matter is here stated the question is no longer concerning the existence of a thing distinct from spirit and idea from perceiving and being perceived but whether there are not certain ideas of i know not what sort in the mind of god which are so many marks or notes that direct him how to produce sensations in our minds in a constant and regular method much after the same manner as a musician is directed by the notes of musick to produce that harmonious train and composition of sound which is called a tune though they who hear the musick do not perceive the notes and may be intirely ignorant of them but this notion of matter seems too extravagant to deserve a confutation besides it is in effect no objection against what we have advanced to wit that there is no senseless unperceived substance if we follow the light of reason we shall from the constant uniform method of our sensations collect the goodness and wisdom of the spirit who excites them in our minds but this is all that i can see reasonably concluded from thence to me i say it is evident that the being of a spirit infinitely wise good and powerful is abundantly sufficient to explain all the appearances of nature but as for inert senseless matter nothing that i perceive has any the least connexion with it or leads to the thoughts of it and i would fain see any one explain any the meanest phænomenon in nature by it or shew any manner of reason though in the lowest rank of probability that he can have for its existence or even make any tolerable sense or meaning of that supposition for as to its being an occasion we have i think evidently shewn that with regard to us it is no occasion it remains therefore that it must be if at all the occasion to god of exciting ideas in us and what this amounts to we have just now seen it is worth while to reflect a little on the motives which induced men to suppose the existence of material substance that so having observed the gradual ceasing and expiration of those motives or reasons we may proportionably withdraw the assent that was grounded on them first therefore it was thought that colour figure motion and the rest of the sensible qualities or accidents did really exist without the mind and for this reason it seemed needful to suppose some unthinking substratum or substance wherein they did exist since they could not be conceived to exist by themselves afterwards in process of time men being convinced that colours sounds and the rest of the sensible secondary qualities had no existence without the mind they stripped this substratum or material substance of those qualities leaving only the primary ones figure motion and such like which they still conceived to exist without the mind and consequently to stand in need of a material support but it having been shewn that none even of these can possibly exist otherwise than in a spirit or mind which perceives them it follows that we have no longer any reason to suppose the being of matter nay that it is utterly impossible there should be any such thing so long as that word is taken to denote an unthinking substratum of qualities or accidents wherein they exist without the mind but though it be allowed by the materialists themselves that matter was thought of only for the sake of supporting accidents and the reason intirely ceasing one might expect the mind should naturally and without any reluctance at all quit the belief of what was solely grounded thereon yet the prejudice is riveted so deeply in our thoughts that we can scarce tell how to part with it and are therefore inclined since the thing it self is indefensible at least to retain the name which we apply to i know not what abstracted and indefinite notions of being or occasion though without any shew of reason at least so far as i can see for what is there on our part or what do we perceive amongst all the ideas sensations notions which are imprinted on our minds either by sense or reflexion from whence may be inferred the existence of an inert thoughtless unperceived occasion and on the other hand on the part of an allsufficient spirit what can there be that should make us believe or even suspect he is directed by an inert occasion to excite ideas in our minds it is a very extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice and much to be lamented that the mind of man retains so great a fondness against all the evidence of reason for a stupid thoughtless somewhat by the interposition whereof it would as it were skreen it self from the providence of god and remove him farther off from the affairs of the world but though we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of matter though when reason forsakes us we endeavour to support our opinion on the bare possibility of the thing and though we indulge our selves in the full scope of an imagination not regulated by reason to make out that poor possibility yet the upshot of all is that there are certain unknown ideas in the mind of god for this if any thing is all that i conceive to be meant by occasion with regard to god and this at the bottom is no longer contending for the thing but for the name whether therefore there are such ideas in the mind of god and whether they may be called by the name matter i shall not dispute but if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of extension motion and other sensible qualities then to me it is most evidently impossible there should be any such thing since it is a plain repugnancy that those qualities should exist in or be supported by an unperceiving substance but say you though it be granted that there is no thoughtless support of extension and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive yet there may perhaps be some inert unperceiving substance or substratum of some other qualities as incomprehensible to us as colours are to a man born blind because we have not a sense adapted to them but if we had a new sense we should possibly no more doubt of their existence than a blindman made to see does of the existence of light and colours i answer first if what you mean by the word matter be only the unknown support of unknown qualities it is no matter whether there is such a thing or no since it no way concerns us and i do not see the advantage there is in disputing about what we know not what and we know not why but secondly if we had a new sense it could only furnish us with new ideas or sensations and then we should have the same reason against their existing in an unperceiving substance that has been already offered with relation to figure motion colour and the like qualities as hath been shewn are nothing else but sensations or ideas which exist only in a mind perceiving them and this is true not only of the ideas we are acquainted with at present but likewise of all possible ideas whatsoever but you will insist what if i have no reason to believe the existence of matter what if i cannot assign any use to it or explain any thing by it or even conceive what is meant by that word yet still it is no contradiction to say that matter exists and that this matter is in general a substance or occasion of ideas though indeed to go about to unfold the meaning or adhere to any particular explication of those words may be attended with great difficulties i answer when words are used without a meaning you may put them together as you please without danger of running into a contradiction you may say for example that twice two is equal to seven so long as you declare you do not take the words of that proposition in their usual acceptation but for marks of you know not what and by the same reason you may say there is an inert thoughtless substance without accidents which is the occasion of our ideas and we shall understand just as much by one proposition as the other in the last place you will say what if we give up the cause of material substance and assert that matter is an unknown somewhat neither substance nor accident spirit nor idea inert thoughtless indivisible immoveable unextended existing in no place for say you whatever may be urged against substance or occasion or any other positive or relative notion of matter hath no place at all so long as this negative definition of matter is adhered to i answer you may if so it shall seem good use the word matter in the same sense that other men use nothing and so make those terms convertible in your style for after all this is what appears to me to be the result of that definition the parts whereof when i consider with attention either collectively or separate from each other i do not find that there is any kind of effect or impression made on my mind different from what is excited by the term nothing you will reply perhaps that in the foresaid definition is included what doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing the positive abstract idea of quiddity entity or existence i own indeed that those who pretend to the faculty of framing abstract general ideas do talk as if they had such an idea which is say they the most abstract and general notion of all that is to me the most incomprehensible of all others that there are a great variety of spirits of different orders and capacities whose faculties both in number and extent are far exceeding those the author of my being has bestowed on me i see no reason to deny and for me to pretend to determine by my own few stinted narrow inlets of perception what ideas the inexhaustible power of the supreme spirit may imprint upon them were certainly the utmost folly and presumption since there may be for ought that i know innumerable sorts of ideas or sensations as different from one another and from all that i have perceived as colours are from sounds but how ready soever i may be to acknowledge the scantiness of my comprehension with regard to the endless variety of spirits and ideas that might possibly exist yet for any one to pretend to a notion of entity or existence abstracted from spirit and idea from perceived and being perceived is i suspect a downright repugnancy and trifling with words it remains that we consider the objections which may possibly be made on the part of religion some there are who think that though the arguments for the real existence of bodies which are drawn from reason be allowed not to amount to demonstration yet the holy scriptures are so clear in the point as will sufficiently convince every good christian that bodies do really exist and are something more than mere ideas there being in holy writ innumerable facts related which evidently suppose the reality of timber and stone mountains and rivers and cities and humane bodies to which i answer that no sort of writings whatever sacred or profane which use those and the like words in the vulgar acceptation or so as to have a meaning in them are in danger of having their truth called in question by our doctrine that all those things do really exist that there are bodies even corporeal substances when taken in the vulgar sense has been shewn to be agreeable to our principles and the difference betwixt things and ideas realities and chimeras has been distinctly explained and i do not think that either what philosophers call matter or the existence of objects without the mind is any where mentioned in scripture again whether there be or be not external things it is agreed on all hands that the proper use of words is the marking our conceptions or things only as they are known and perceived by us whence it plainly follows that in the tenets we have laid down there is nothing inconsistent with the right use and significancy of language and that discourse of what kind soever so far as it is intelligible remains undisturbed but all this seems so manifest from what hath been set forth in the premises that it is needless to insist any farther on it but it will be urged that miracles do at least lose much of their stress and import by our principles what must we think of mosess rod was it not really turned into a serpent or was there only a change of ideas in the minds of the spectators and can it be supposed that our saviour did no more at the marriagefeast in cana than impose on the sight and smell and taste of the guests so as to create in them the appearance or idea only of wine the same may be said of all other miracles which in consequence of the foregoing principles must be looked upon only as so many cheats or illusions of fancy to this i reply that the rod was changed into a real serpent and the water into real wine that this doth not in the least contradict what i have elsewhere said will be evident from sect and but this business of real and imaginary hath been already so plainly and fully explained and so often referred to and the difficulties about it are so easily answered from what hath gone before that it were an affront to the readers understanding to resume the explication of it in this place i shall only observe that if at table all who were present should see and smell and taste and drink wine and find the effects of it with me there could be no doubt of its reality so that at bottom the scruple concerning real miracles hath no place at all on ours but only on the received principles and consequently maketh rather for than against what hath been said having done with the objections which i endeavoured to propose in the clearest light and gave them all the force and weight i could we proceed in the next place to take a view of our tenets in their consequences some of these appear at first sight as that several difficult and obscure questions on which abundance of speculation hath been thrown away are intirely banished from philosophy whether corporeal substance can think whether sect xxix xxx xxxiii xxxvi c matter be infinitely divisible and how it operates on spirit these and like inquiries have given infinite amusement to philosophers in all ages but depending on the existence of matter they have no longer any place on our principles many other advantages there are as well with regard to religion as the sciences which it is easy for any one to deduce from what hath been premised but this will appear more plainly in the sequel from the principles we have laid down it follows humane knowledge may naturally be reduced to two heads that of ideas and that of spirits of each of these i shall treat in order and first as to ideas or unthinking things our knowledge of these hath been very much obscured and confounded and we have been led into very dangerous errors by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of sense the one intelligible or in the mind the other real and without the mind whereby unthinking things are thought to have a natural subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by spirits this which if i mistake not hath been shewn to be a most groundless and absurd notion is the very root of scepticism for so long as men thought that real things subsisted without the mind and that their knowledge was only so far forth real as it was conformable to real things it follows they could not be certain they had any real knowledge at all for how can it be known that the things which are perceived are conformable to those which are not perceived or exist without the mind colour figure motion extension and the like considered only as so many sensations in the mind are perfectly known there being nothing in them which is not perceived but if they are looked on as notes or images referred to things or archetypes existing without the mind then are we involved all in scepticism we see only the appearances and not the real qualities of things what may be the extension figure or motion of any thing really and absolutely or in it self it is impossible for us to know but only the proportion or the relation they bear to our senses things remaining the same our ideas vary and which of them or even whether any of them at all represent the true quality really existing in the thing it is out of our reach to determine so that for ought we know all we see hear and feel may be only phantom and vain chimera and not at all agree with the real things existing in rerum natura all this scepticism follows from our supposing a difference between things and ideas and that the former have a subsistence without the mind or unperceived it were easy to dilate on this subject and shew how the arguments urged by sceptics in all ages depend on the supposition of external objects so long as we attribute a real existence to unthinking things distinct from their being perceived it is not only impossible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real unthinking being but even that it exists hence it is that we see philosophers distrust their senses and doubt of the existence of heaven and earth of every thing they see or feel even of their own bodies and after all their labour and struggle of thought they are forced to own we cannot attain to any selfevident or demonstrative knowledge of the existence of sensible things but all this doubtfulness which so bewilders and confounds the mind and makes philosophy ridiculous in the eyes of the world vanishes if we annex a meaning to our words and do not amuse our selves with the terms absolute external exist and such like signifying we know not what i can as well doubt of my own being as of the being of those things which i actually perceive by sense it being a manifest contradiction that any sensible object should be immediately perceived by sight or touch and at the same time have no existence in nature since the very existence of an unthinking being consists in being perceived nothing seems of more importance towards erecting a firm systeme of sound and real knowledge which may be proof against the assaults of scepticism than to lay the beginning in a distinct explication of what is meant by thing reality existence for in vain shall we dispute concerning the real existence of things or pretend to any knowledge thereof so long as we have not fixed the meaning of those words thing or being is the most general name of all it comprehends under it two kinds intirely distinct and heterogeneous and which have nothing common but the name to wit spirits and ideas the former are active indivisible substances the latter are inert fleeting dependent beings which subsist not by themselves but are supported by or exist in minds or spiritual substances we comprehend our own existence by inward feeling or reflexion and that of other spirits by reason we may be said to have some knowledge or notion of our own minds of spirits and active beings whereof in a strict sense we have not ideas in like manner we know and have a notion of relations between things or ideas which relations are distinct from the ideas or things related inasmuch as the latter may be perceived by us without our perceiving the former to me it seems that ideas spirits and relations are all in their respective kinds the object of humane knowledge and subject of discourse and that the term idea would be improperly extended to signify every thing we know or have any notion of ideas imprinted on the senses are real things or do really exist this we do not deny but we deny they can subsist without the minds which perceive them or that they are resemblances of any archetypes existing without the mind since the very being of a sensation or idea consists in being perceived and an idea can be like nothing but an idea again the things perceived by sense may be termed external with regard to their origin in that they are not generated from within by the mind it self but imprinted by a spirit distinct from that which perceives them sensible objects may likewise be said to be without the mind in another sense namely when they exist in some other mind thus when i shut my eyes the things i saw may still exist but it must be in another mind it were a mistake to think that what is here said derogates in the least from the reality of things it is acknowledged on the received principles that extension motion and in a word all sensible qualities have need of a support as not being able to subsist by themselves but the objects perceived by sense are allowed to be nothing but combinations of those qualities and consequently cannot subsist by themselves thus far it is agreed on all hands so that in denying the things perceived by sense an existence independent of a substance or support wherein they may exist we detract nothing from the received opinion of their reality and are guilty of no innovation in that respect all the difference is that according to us the unthinking beings perceived by sense have no existence distinct from being perceived and cannot therefore exist in any other substance than those unextended indivisible substances or spirits which act and think and perceive them whereas philosophers vulgarly hold that the sensible qualities exist in an inert extended unperceiving substance which they call matter to which they attribute a natural subsistence exterior to all thinking beings or distinct from being perceived by any mind whatsoever even the eternal mind of the creator wherein they suppose only ideas of the corporeal substances created by him if indeed they allow them to be at all created for as we have shewn the doctrine of matter or corporeal substance to have been the main pillar and support of scepticism so likewise upon the same foundation have been raised all the impious schemes of atheism and irreligion nay so great a difficulty hath it been thought to conceive matter produced out of nothing that the most celebrated among the ancient philosophers even of these who maintained the being of a god have thought matter to be uncreated and coeternal with him how great a friend material substance hath been to atheists in all ages were needless to relate all their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence on it that when this cornerstone is once removed the whole fabrick cannot choose but fall to the ground insomuch that it is no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of atheists that impious and profane persons should readily fall in with those systems which favour their inclinations by deriding immaterial substance and supposing the soul to be divisible and subject to corruption as the body which exclude all freedom intelligence and design from the formation of things and instead thereof make a selfexistent stupid unthinking substance the root and origin of all beings that they should hearken to those who deny a providence or inspection of a superior mind over the affairs of the world attributing the whole series of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity arising from the impulse of one body on another all this is very natural and on the other hand when men of better principles observe the enemies of religion lay so great a stress on unthinking matter and all of them use so much industry and artifice to reduce every thing to it methinks they should rejoice to see them deprived of their grand support and driven from that only fortress without which your epicureans hobbists and the like have not even the shadow of a pretence but become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world the existence of matter or bodies unperceived has not only been the main support of atheists and fatalists but on the same principle doth idolatry likewise in all its various forms depend did men but consider that the sun moon and stars and every other object of the senses are only so many sensations in their minds which have no other existence but barely being perceived doubtless they would never fall down and worship their own ideas but rather address their homage to that eternal invisible mind which produces and sustains all things the same absurd principle by mingling it self with the articles of our faith hath occasioned no small difficulties to christians for example about the resurrection how many scruples and objections have been raised by socinians and others but do not the most plausible of them depend on the supposition that a body is denominated the same with regard not to the form or that which is perceived by sense but the material substance which remains the same under several forms take away this material substance about the identity whereof all the dispute is and mean by body what every plain ordinary person means by that word to wit that which is immediately seen and felt which is only a combination of sensible qualities or ideas and then their most unanswerable objections come to nothing matter being once expelled out of nature drags with it so many sceptical and impious notions such an incredible number of disputes and puzling questions which have been thorns in the sides of divines as well as philosophers and made so much fruitless work for mankind that if the arguments we have produced against it are not found equal to demonstration as to me they evidently seem yet i am sure all friends to knowledge peace and religion have reason to wish they were beside the external existence of the objects of perception another great source of errors and difficulties with regard to ideal knowledge is the doctrine of abstract ideas such as it hath been set forth in the introduction the plainest things in the world those we are most intimately acquainted with and perfectly know when they are considered in an abstract way appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible time place and motion taken in particular or concrete are what every body knows but having passed through the hands of a metaphysician they become too abstract and fine to be apprehended by men of ordinary sense bid your servant meet you at such a time in such a place and he shall never stay to deliberate on the meaning of those words in conceiving that particular time and place or the motion by which he is to get thither he finds not the least difficulty but if time be taken exclusive of all those particular actions and ideas that diversify the day merely for the continuation of existence or duration in abstract then it will perhaps gravel even a philosopher to comprehend it whenever i attempt to frame a simple idea of time abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind which flows uniformly and is participated by all beings i am lost and embrangled in inextricable difficulties i have no notion of it at all only i hear others say it is infinitely divisible and speak of it in such a manner as leads me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence since that doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of thinking either that he passes away innumerable ages without a thought or else that he is annihilated every moment of his life both which seem equally absurd time therefore being nothing abstracted from the sucession of ideas in our minds it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each other in that same spirit or mind hence it is a plain consequence that the soul always thinks and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation will i believe find it no easy task so likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities and consider them by themselves we presently lose sight of them and run into great extravagancies all which depend on a twofold abstraction first it is supposed that extension for example may be abstracted from all other sensible qualities and secondly that the entity of extension may be abstracted from its being perceived but whoever shall reflect and take care to understand what he says will if i mistake not acknowledge that all sensible qualities are alike sensations and alike real that where the extension is there is the colour too to wit in his mind and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind and that the objects of sense are nothing but those sensations combined blended or if one may so speak concreted together none of all which can be supposed to exist unperceived what it is for a man to be happy or an object good every one may think he knows but to frame an abstract idea of happiness prescinded from all particular pleasure or of goodness from every thing that is good this is what few can pretend to so likewise a man may be just and virtuous without having precise ideas of justice and virtue the opinion that those and the like words stand for general notions abstracted from all particular persons and actions seems to have rendered morality difficult and the study thereof of less use to mankind and in effect the doctrine of abstraction has not a little contributed towards spoiling the most useful parts of knowledge the two great provinces of speculative science conversant about ideas received from sense and their relations are natural philosophy and mathematics with regard to each of these i shall make some observations and first i shall say somewhat of natural philosophy on this subject it is that the sceptics triumph all that stock of arguments they produce to depreciate our faculties and make mankind appear ignorant and low are drawn principally from this head to wit that we are under an invincible blindness as to the true and real nature of things this they exaggerate and love to enlarge on we are miserably bantered say they by our senses and amused only with the outside and shew of things the real essence the internal qualities and constitution of every the meanest object is hid from our view something there is in every drop of water every grain of sand which it is beyond the power of humane understanding to fathom or comprehend but it is evident from what has been shewn that all this complaint is groundless and that we are influenced by false principles to that degree as to mistrust our senses and think we know nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend one great inducement to our pronouncing our selves ignorant of the nature of things is the current opinion that every thing includes within it self the cause of its properties or that there is in each object an inward essence which is the source whence its discernible qualities flow and whereon they depend some have pretended to account for appearances by occult qualities but of late they are mostly resolved into mechanical causes to wit the figure motion weight and such like qualities of insensible particles whereas in truth there is no other agent or efficient cause than spirit it being evident that motion as well as all other ideas is perfectly inert see sect hence to endeavour to explain the production of colours or sounds by figure motion magnitude and the like must needs be labour in vain and accordingly we see the attempts of that kind are not at all satisfactory which may be said in general of those instances wherein one idea or quality is assigned for the cause of another i need not say how many hypotheses and speculations are left out and how much the study of nature is abridged by this doctrine the great mechanical principle now in vogue is attraction that a stone falls to the earth or the sea swells towards the moon may to some appear sufficiently explained thereby but how are we enlightened by being told this is done by attraction is it that that word signifies the manner of the tendency and that it is by the mutual drawing of bodies instead of their being impelled or protruded towards each other but nothing is determined of the manner or action and it may as truly for ought we know be termed impulse or protrusion as attraction again the parts of steel we see cohere firmly together and this also is accounted for by attraction but in this as in the other instances i do not perceive that any thing is signified besides the effect it self for as to the manner of the action whereby it is produced or the cause which produces it these are not so much as aimed at indeed if we take a view of the several phænomena and compare them together we may observe some likeness and conformity between them for example in the falling of a stone to the ground in the rising of the sea towards the moon in cohesion and crystallization there is something alike namely an union or mutual approach of bodies so that any one of these or the like phænomena may not seem strange or surprising to a man who hath nicely observed and compared the effects of nature for that only is thought so which is uncommon or a thing by it self and out of the ordinary course of our observation that bodies should tend towards the center of the earth is not thought strange because it is what we perceive every moment of our lives but that they should have a like gravitation towards the center of the moon may seem odd and unaccountable to most men because it is discerned only in the tides but a philosopher whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature having observed a certain similitude of appearances as well in the heavens as the earth that argue innumerable bodies to have a mutual tendency towards each other which he denotes by the general name attraction whatever can be reduced to that he thinks justly accounted for thus he explains the tides by the attraction of the terraqueous globe towards the moon which to him doth not appear odd or anomalous but only a particular example of a general rule or law of nature if therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural philosophers and other men with regard to their knowledge of the phænomena we shall find it consists not in an exacter knowledge of the efficient cause that produces them for that can be no other than the will of a spirit but only in a greater largeness of comprehension whereby analogies harmonies and agreements are discovered in the works of nature and the particular effects explained that is reduced to general rules see sect which rules grounded on the analogy and uniformness observed in the production of natural effects are most agreeable and sought after by the mind for that they extend our prospect beyond what is present and near to us and enable us to make very probable conjectures touching things that may have happened at very great distances of time and place as well as to predict things to come which sort of endeavour towards omniscience is much affected by the mind but we should proceed warily in such things for we are apt to lay too great a stress on analogies and to the prejudice of truth humour that eagerness of the mind whereby it is carried to extend its knowledge into general theoremes for example gravitation or mutual attraction because it appears in many instances some are straightway for pronouncing universal and that to attract and be attracted by every other body is an essential quality inherent in all bodies whatsoever whereas it appears the fixed stars have no such tendency towards each other and so far is that gravitation from being essential to bodies that in some instances a quite contrary principle seems to shew it self as in the perpendicular growth of plants and the elasticity of the air there is nothing necessary or essential in the case but it depends intirely on the will of the governing spirit who causes certain bodies to cleave together or tend towards each other according to various laws whilst he keeps others at a fixed distance and to some he gives a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder just as he sees convenient after what has been premised i think we may lay down the following conclusions first it is plain philosophers amuse themselves in vain when they inquire for any natural efficient cause distinct from a mind or spirit secondly considering the whole creation is the workmanship of a wise and good agent it should seem to become philosophers to employ their thoughts contrary to what some hold about the final causes of things and i must confess i see no reason why pointing out the various ends to which natural things are adapted and for which they were originally with unspeakable wisdom contrived should not be thought one good way of accounting for them and altogether worthy a philosopher thirdly from what hath been premised no reason can be drawn why the history of nature should not still be studied and observations and experiments made which that they are of use to mankind and enable us to draw any general conclusions is not the result of any immutable habitudes or relations between things themselves but only of gods goodness and kindness to men in the administration of the world see sect and fourthly by a diligent observation of the phænomena within our view we may discover the general laws of nature and from them deduce the other phænomena i do not say demonstrate for all deductions of that kind depend on a supposition that the author of nature always operates uniformly and in a constant observance of those rules we take for principles which we cannot evidently know those men who frame general rules from the phænomena and afterwards derive the phænomena from those rules seem to consider signs rather than causes a man may well understand natural signs without knowing their analogy or being able to say by what rule a thing is so or so and as it is very possible to write improperly through too strict an observance of general grammarrules so in arguing from general rules of nature it is not impossible we may extend the analogy too far and by that means run into mistakes as in reading other books a wise man will choose to fix his thoughts on the sense and apply it to use rather than lay them out in grammatical remarks on the language so in perusing the volume of nature it seems beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each particular phænomenon to general rules or shewing how it follows from them we should propose to ourselves nobler views such as to recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty order extent and variety of natural things hence by proper inferences to enlarge our notions of the grandeur wisdom and beneficence of the creator and lastly to make the several parts of the creation so far as in us lies subservient to the ends they were designed for gods glory and the sustentation and comfort of our selves and fellowcreatures the best key for the aforesaid analogy or natural science will be easily acknowledged to be a certain celebrated treatise of mechanics in the entrance of which justly admired treatise time space and motion are distinguished into absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and vulgar which distinction as it is at large explained by the author doth suppose those quantities to have an existence without the mind and that they are ordinarily conceived with relation to sensible things to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no relation at all as for time as it is there taken in an absolute or abstracted sense for the duration or perseverance of the existence of things i have nothing more to add concerning it after what hath been already said on that subject sect and for the rest this celebrated author holds there is an absolute space which being unperceivable to sense remains in it self similar and immoveable and relative space to be the measure thereof which being moveable and defined by its situation in respect of sensible bodies is vulgarly taken for immoveable space place he defines to be that part of space which is occupied by any body and according as the space is absolute or relative so also is the place absolute motion is said to be the translation of a body from absolute place to absolute place as relative motion is from one relative place to another and because the parts of absolute space do not fall under our senses instead of them we are obliged to use their sensible measures and so define both place and motion with respect to bodies which we regard as immoveable but it is said in philosophical matters we must abstract from our senses since it may be that none of those bodies which seem to be quiescent are truly so and the same thing which is moved relatively may be really at rest as likewise one and the same body may be in relative rest and motion or even moved with contrary relative motions at the same time according as its place is variously defined all which ambiguity is to be found in the apparent motions but not at all in the true or absolute which should therefore be alone regarded in philosophy and the true we are told are distinguished from apparent or relative motions by the following properties first in true or absolute motion all parts which preserve the same position with respect to the whole partake of the motions of the whole secondly the place being moved that which is placed therein is also moved so that a body moving in a place which is in motion doth participate the motion of its place thirdly true motion is never generated or changed otherwise than by force impressed on the body it self fourthly true motion is always changed by force impressed on the body moved fifthly in circular motion barely relative there is no centrifugal force which nevertheless in that which is true or absolute is proportional to the quantity of motion but notwithstanding what hath been said it doth not appear to me that there can be any motion other than relative so that to conceive motion there must be at least conceived two bodies whereof the distance or position in regard to each other is varied hence if there was one only body in being it could not possibly be moved this seems evident in that the idea i have of motion doth necessarily include relation but though in every motion it be necessary to conceive more bodies than one yet it may be that one only is moved namely that on which the force causing the change of distance is impressed or in other words that to which the action is applied for however some may define relative motion so as to term that body moved which changes its distance from some other body whether the force or action causing that change were applied to it or no yet as relative motion is that which is perceived by sense and regarded in the ordinary affairs of life it should seem that every man of common sense knows what it is as well as the best philosopher now i ask any one whether in his sense of motion as he walks along the streets the stones he passes over may be said to move because they change distance with his feet to me it seems that though motion includes a relation of one thing to another yet it is not necessary that each term of the relation be denominated from it as a man may think of somewhat which doth not think so a body may be moved to or from another body which is not therefore it self in motion as the place happens to be variously defined the motion which is related to it varies a man in a ship may be said to be quiescent with relation to the sides of the vessel and yet move with relation to the land or he may move eastward in respect of the one and westward in respect of the other in the common affairs of life men never go beyond the earth to define the place of any body and what is quiescent in respect of that is accounted absolutely to be so but philosophers who have a greater extent of thought and juster notions of the system of things discover even the earth it self to be moved in order therefore to fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite and the utmost unmoved walls or shell thereof to be the place whereby they estimate true motions if we sound our own conceptions i believe we may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom no other than relative motion thus defined for as hath been already observed absolute motion exclusive of all external relation is incomprehensible and to this kind of relative motion all the abovementioned properties causes and effects ascribed to absolute motion will if i mistake not be found to agree as to what is said of the centrifugal force that it doth not at all belong to circular relative motion i do not see how this follows from the experiment which is brought to prove it see philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica in schol def for the water in the vessel at that time wherein it is said to have the greatest relative circular motion hath i think no motion at all as is plain from the foregoing section for to denominate a body moved it is requisite first that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other body and secondly that the force or action occasioning that change be applied to it if either of these be wanting i do not think that agreeably to the sense of mankind or the propriety of language a body can be said to be in motion i grant indeed that it is possible for us to think a body which we see change its distance from some other to be moved though it have no force applied to it in which sense there may be apparent motion but then it is because the force causing the change of distance is imagined by us to be applied or impressed on that body thought to move which indeed shews we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in motion which is not and that is all from what hath been said it follows that the philosophic consideration of motion doth not imply the being of an absolute space distinct from that which is perceived by sense and related to bodies which that it cannot exist without the mind is clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like of all other objects of sense and perhaps if we inquire narrowly we shall find we cannot even frame an idea of pure space exclusive of all body this i must confess seems impossible as being a most abstract idea when i excite a motion in some part of my body if it be free or without resistance i say there is space but if i find a resistance then i say there is body and in proportion as the resistance to motion is lesser or greater i say the space is more or less pure so that when i speak of pure or empty space it is not to be supposed that the word space stands for an idea distinct from or conceivable without body and motion though indeed we are apt to think every noun substantive stands for a distinct idea that may be separated from all others which hath occasioned infinite mistakes when therefore supposing all the world to be annihilated besides my own body i say there still remains pure space thereby nothing else is meant but only that i conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all sides without the least resistance but if that too were annihilated then there could be no motion and consequently no space some perhaps may think the sense of seeing doth furnish them with the idea of pure space but it is plain from what we have elsewhere shewn that the ideas of space and distance are not obtained by that sense see the essay concerning vision what is here laid down seems to put an end to all those disputes and difficulties which have sprung up amongst the learned concerning the nature of pure space but the chief advantage arising from it is that we are freed from that dangerous dilemma to which several who have employed their thoughts on this subject imagine themselves reduced to wit of thinking either that real space is god or else that there is something beside god which is eternal uncreated infinite indivisible immutable both which may justly be thought pernicious and absurd notions it is certain that not a few divines as well as philosophers of great note have from the difficulty they found in conceiving either limits or annihilation of space concluded it must be divine and some of late have set themselves particularly to shew that the incommunicable attributes of god agree to it which doctrine how unworthy soever it may seem of the divine nature yet i do not see how we can get clear of it so long as we adhere to the received opinions hitherto of natural philosophy we come now to make some inquiry concerning that other great branch of speculative knowledge to wit mathematics these how celebrated soever they may be for their clearness and certainty of demonstration which is hardly any where else to be found cannot nevertheless be supposed altogether free from mistakes if in their principles there lurks some secret error which is common to the professors of those sciences with the rest of mankind mathematicians though they deduce their theoremes from a great height of evidence yet their first principles are limited by the consideration of quantity and they do not ascend into any inquiry concerning those transcendental maxims which influence all the particular sciences each part whereof mathematics not excepted doth consequently participate of the errors involved in them that the principles laid down by mathematicians are true and their way of deduction from those principles clear and incontestible we do not deny but we hold there may be certain erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of mathematics and for that reason not expresly mentioned though tacitly supposed throughout the whole progress of that science and that the ill effects of those secret unexamined errors are diffused through all the branches thereof to be plain we suspect the mathematicians are as well as other men concerned in the errors arising from the doctrine of abstract general ideas and the existence of objects without the mind arithmetic hath been thought to have for its object abstract ideas of number of which to understand the properties and mutual habitudes is supposed no mean part of speculative knowledge the opinion of the pure and intellectual nature of numbers in abstract hath made them in esteem with those philosophers who seem to have affected an uncommon fineness and elevation of thought it hath set a price on the most trifling numerical speculations which in practice are of no use but serve only for amusement and hath therefore so far infected the minds of some that they have dreamed of mighty mysteries involved in numbers and attempted the explication of natural things by them but if we inquire into our own thoughts and consider what hath been premised we may perhaps entertain a low opinion of those high flights and abstractions and look on all inquiries about numbers only as so many difficiles nugæ so far as they are not subservient to practice and promote the benefit of life unity in abstract we have before considered in sect from which and what hath been said in the introduction it plainly follows there is not any such idea but number being defined a collection of unites we may conclude that if there be no such thing as unity or unite in abstract there are no ideas of number in abstract denoted by the numeral names and figures the theories therefore in arithmetic if they are abstracted from the names and figures as likewise from all use and practice as well as from the particular things numbered can be supposed to have nothing at all for their object hence we may see how intirely the science of numbers is subordinate to practice and how jejune and trifling it becomes when considered as a matter of mere speculation however since there may be some who deluded by the specious shew of discovering abstracted verities waste their time in arithmetical theoremes and problemes which have not any use it will not be amiss if we more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretence and this will plainly appear by taking a view of arithmetic in its infancy and observing what it was that originally put men on the study of that science and to what scope they directed it it is natural to think that at first men for ease of memory and help of computation made use of counters or in writing of single strokes points or the like each whereof was made to signify an unite that is some one thing of whatever kind they had occasion to reckon afterwards they found out the more compendious ways of making one character stand in place of several strokes or points and lastly the notation of the arabians or indians came into use wherein by the repetition of a few characters or figures and varying the signification of each figure according to the place it obtains all numbers may be most aptly expressed which seems to have been done in imitation of language so that an exact analogy is observed betwixt the notation by figures and names the nine simple figures answering the nine first numeral names and places in the former corresponding to denominations in the latter and agreeably to those conditions of the simple and local value of figures were contrived methods of finding from the given figures or marks of the parts what figures and how placed are proper to denote the whole or vice versa and having found the sought figures the same rule or analogy being observed throughout it is easy to read them into words and so the number becomes perfectly known for then the number of any particular things is said to be known when we know the name or figures with their due arrangement that according to the standing analogy belong to them for these signs being known we can by the operations of arithmetic know the signs of any part of the particular sums signified by them and thus computing in signs because of the connexion established betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of things whereof one is taken for an unite we may be able rightly to sum up divide and proportion the things themselves that we intend to number in arithmetic therefore we regard not the things but the signs which nevertheless are not regarded for their own sake but because they direct us how to act with relation to things and dispose rightly of them now agreeably to what we have before observed of words in general sect introd it happens here likewise that abstract ideas are thought to be signified by numeral names or characters while they do not suggest ideas of particular things to our minds i shall not at present enter into a more particular dissertation on this subject but only observe that it is evident from what hath been said those things which pass for abstract truths and theoremes concerning numbers are in reality conversant about no object distinct from particular numerable things except only names and characters which originally came to be considered on no other account but their being signs or capable to represent aptly whatever particular things men had need to compute whence it follows that to study them for their own sake would be just as wise and to as good purpose as if a man neglecting the true use or original intention and subserviency of language should spend his time in impertinent criticisms upon words or reasonings and controversies purely verbal from numbers we proceed to speak of extension which considered as relative is the object of geometry the infinite divisibility of finite extension though it is not expresly laid down either as an axiome or theoreme in the elements of that science yet is throughout the same every where supposed and thought to have so inseparable and essential a connexion with the principles and demonstrations in geometry that mathematicians never admit it into doubt or make the least question of it and as this notion is the source from whence do spring all those amusing geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the plain common sense of mankind and are admitted with so much reluctance into a mind not yet debauched by learning so it is the principal occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty which renders the study of mathematics so difficult and tedious hence if we can make it appear that no finite extension contains innumerable parts or is infinitely divisible it follows that we shall at once clear the science of geometry from a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever been esteemed a reproach to humane reason and withal make the attainment thereof a business of much less time and pains than it hitherto hath been every particular finite extension which may possibly be the object of our thought is an idea existing only in the mind and consequently each part thereof must be perceived if therefore i cannot perceive innumerable parts in any finite extension that i consider it is certain they are not contained in it but it is evident that i cannot distinguish innumerable parts in any particular line surface or solid which i either perceive by sense or figure to my self in my mind wherefore i conclude they are not contained in it nothing can be plainer to me than that the extensions i have in view are no other than my own ideas and it is no less plain that i cannot resolve any one of my ideas into an infinite number of other ideas that is that they are not infinitely divisible if by finite extension be meant something distinct from a finite idea i declare i do not know what that is and so cannot affirm or deny any thing of it but if the terms extension parts and the like are taken in any sense conceivable that is for ideas then to say a finite quantity or extension consists of parts infinite in number is so manifest a contradiction that every one at first sight acknowledges it to be so and it is impossible it should ever gain the assent of any reasonable creature who is not brought to it by gentle and slow degrees as a converted gentile to the belief of transubstantiation ancient and rooted prejudices do often pass into principles and those propositions which once obtain the force and credit of a principle are not only themselves but likewise whatever is deducible from them thought privileged from all examination and there is no absurdity so gross which by this means the mind of man may not be prepared to swallow he whose understanding is prepossest with the doctrine of abstract general ideas may be persuaded that whatever be thought of the ideas of sense extension in abstract is infinitely divisible and one who thinks the objects of sense exist without the mind will perhaps in virtue thereof be brought to admit that a line but an inch long may contain innumerable parts really existing though too small to be discerned these errors are grafted as well in the minds of geometricians as of other men and have a like influence on their reasonings and it were no difficult thing to shew how the arguments from geometry made use of to support the infinite divisibility of extension are bottomed on them at present we shall only observe in general whence it is that the mathematicians are all so fond and tenacious of this doctrine it hath been observed in another place that the theoremes and demonstrations in geometry are conversant about universal ideas sect introd where it is explained in what sense this ought to be understood to wit that the particular lines and figures included in the diagram are supposed to stand for innumerable others of different sizes or in other words the geometer considers them abstracting from their magnitude which doth not imply that he forms an abstract idea but only that he cares not what the particular magnitude is whether great or small but looks on that as a thing indifferent to the demonstration hence it follows that a line in the scheme but an inch long must be spoken of as though it contained ten thousand parts since it is regarded not in it self but as it is universal and it is universal only in its signification whereby it represents innumerable lines greater than it self in which may be distinguished ten thousand parts or more though there may not be above an inch in it after this manner the properties of the lines signified are by a very usual figure transferred to the sign and thence through mistake thought to appertain to it considered in its own nature because there is no number of parts so great but it is possible there may be a line containing more the inchline is said to contain parts more than any assignable number which is true not of the inch taken absolutely but only for the things signified by it but men not retaining that distinction in their thoughts slide into a belief that the small particular line described on paper contains in it self parts innumerable there is no such thing as the tenthousandth part of an inch but there is of a mile or diameter of the earth which may be signified by that inch when therefore i delineate a triangle on paper and take one side not above an inch for example in length to be the radius this i consider as divided into ten thousand or an hundred thousand parts or more for though the tenthousandth part of that line considered in it self is nothing at all and consequently may be neglected without any error or inconveniency yet these described lines being only marks standing for greater quantities whereof it may be the tenthousandth part is very considerable it follows that to prevent notable errors in practice the radius must be taken of ten thousand parts or more from what hath been said the reason is plain why to the end any theoreme may become universal in its use it is necessary we speak of the lines described on paper as though they contained parts which really they do not in doing of which if we examine the matter throughly we shall perhaps discover that we cannot conceive an inch it self as consisting of or being divisible into a thousand parts but only some other line which is far greater than an inch and represented by it and that when we say a line is infinitely divisible we must mean a line which is infinitely great what we have here observed seems to be the chief cause why to suppose the infinite divisibility of finite extension hath been thought necessary in geometry the several absurdities and contradictions which flowed from this false principle might one would think have been esteemed so many demonstrations against it but by i know not what logic it is held that proofs a posteriori are not to be admitted against propositions relating to infinity as though it were not impossible even for an infinite mind to reconcile contradictions or as if any thing absurd and repugnant could have a necessary connexion with truth or flow from it but whoever considers the weakness of this pretence will think it was contrived on purpose to humour the laziness of the mind which had rather acquiesce in an indolent scepticism than be at the pains to go through with a severe examination of those principles it hath ever embraced for true of late the speculations about infinities have run so high and grown to such strange notions as have occasioned no small scruples and disputes among the geometers of the present age some there are of great note who not content with holding that finite lines may be divided into an infinite number of parts do yet farther maintain that each of those infinitesimals is it self subdivisible into an infinity of other parts or infinitesimals of a second order and so on ad infinitum these i say assert there are infinitesimals of infinitesimals of infinitesimals without ever coming to an end so that according to them an inch doth not barely contain an infinite number of parts but an infinity of an infinity of an infinity ad infinitum of parts others there be who hold all orders of infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all thinking it with good reason absurd to imagine there is any positive quantity or part of extension which though multiplied infinitely can ever equal the smallest given extension and yet on the other hand it seems no less absurd to think the square cube or other power of a positive real root should it self be nothing at all which they who hold infinitesimals of the first order denying all of the subsequent orders are obliged to maintain have we not therefore reason to conclude they are both in the wrong and that there is in effect no such thing as parts infinitely small or an infinite number of parts contained in any finite quantity but you will say that if this doctrine obtains it will follow the very foundations of geometry are destroyed and those great men who have raised that science to so astonishing an height have been all the while building a castle in the air to this it may be replied that whatever is useful in geometry and promotes the benefit of humane life doth still remain firm and unshaken on our principles that science considered as practical will rather receive advantage than any prejudice from what hath been said but to set this in a due light may be the subject of a distinct inquiry for the rest though it should follow that some of the more intricate and subtile parts of speculative mathematics may be pared off without any prejudice to truth yet i do not see what damage will be thence derived to mankind on the contrary it were highly to be wished that men of great abilities and obstinate application would draw off their thoughts from those amusements and employ them in the study of such things as lie nearer the concerns of life or have a more direct influence on the manners if it be said that several theoremes undoubtedly true are discovered by methods in which infinitesimals are made use of which could never have been if their existence included a contradiction in it i answer that upon a thorough examination it will not be found that in any instance it is necessary to make use of or conceive infinitesimal parts of finite lines or even quantities less than the minimum sensible nay it will be evident this is never done it being impossible by what we have premised it is plain that very numerous and important errors have taken their rise from those false principles which were impugned in the foregoing parts of this treatise and the opposites of those erroneous tenets at the same time appear to be most fruitful principles from whence do flow innumerable consequences highly advantageous to true philosophy as well as to religion particularly matter or the absolute existence of corporeal objects hath been shewn to be that wherein the most avowed and pernicious enemies of all knowledge whether humane or divine have ever placed their chief strength and confidence and surely if by distinguishing the real existence of unthinking things from their being perceived and allowing them a subsistence of their own out of the minds of spirits no one thing is explained in nature but on the contrary a great many inexplicable difficulties arise if the supposition of matter is barely precarious as not being grounded on so much as one single reason if its consequences cannot endure the light of examination and free inquiry but skreen themselves under the dark and general pretence of infinites being incomprehensible if withal the removal of this matter be not attended with the least evil consequence if it be not even missed in the world but every thing as well nay much easier conceived without it if lastly both sceptics and atheists are for ever silenced upon supposing only spirits and ideas and this scheme of things is perfectly agreeable both to reason and religion methinks we may expect it should be admitted and firmly embraced though it were proposed only as an hypothesis and the existence of matter had been allowed possible which yet i think we have evidently demonstrated that it is not true it is that in consequence of the foregoing principles several disputes and speculations which are esteemed no mean parts of learning are rejected as useless but how great a prejudice soever against our notions this may give to those who have already been deeply engaged and made large advances in studies of that nature yet by others we hope it will not be thought any just ground of dislike to the principles and tenets herein laid down that they abridge the labour of study and make humane sciences more clear compendious and attainable than they were before having despatched what we intended to say concerning the knowledge of ideas the method we proposed leads us in the next place to treat of spirits with regard to which perhaps humane knowledge is not so deficient as is vulgarly imagined the great reason that is assigned for our being thought ignorant of the nature of spirits is our not having an idea of it but surely it ought not to be looked on as a defect in a humane understanding that it does not perceive the idea of spirit if it is manifestly impossible there should be any such idea and this if i mistake not has been demonstrated in sect to which i shall here add that a spirit has been shewn to be the only substance or support wherein the unthinking beings or ideas can exist but that this substance which supports or perceives ideas should it self be an idea or like an idea is evidently absurd it will perhaps be said that we want a sense as some have imagined proper to know substances withal which if we had we might know our own soul as we do a triangle to this i answer that in case we had a new sense bestowed upon us we could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense but i believe no body will say that what he means by the terms soul and substance is only some particular sort of idea or sensation we may therefore infer that all things duly considered it is not more reasonable to think our faculties defective in that they do not furnish us with an idea of spirit or active thinking substance than it would be if we should blame them for not being able to comprehend a round square from the opinion that spirits are to be known after the manner of an idea or sensation have risen many absurd and heterodox tenets and much scepticism about the nature of the soul it is even probable that this opinion may have produced a doubt in some whether they had any soul at all distinct from their body since upon inquiry they could not find they had an idea of it that an idea which is inactive and the existence whereof consists in being perceived should be the image or likeness of an agent subsisting by it self seems to need no other refutation than barely attending to what is meant by those words but perhaps you will say that tho an idea cannot resemble a spirit in its thinking acting or subsisting by it self yet it may in some other respects and it is not necessary that an idea or image be in all respects like the original i answer if it does not in those mentioned it is impossible it should represent it in any other thing do but leave out the power of willing thinking and perceiving ideas and there remains nothing else wherein the idea can be like a spirit for by the word spirit we mean only that which thinks wills and perceives this and this alone constitutes the signification of that term if therefore it is impossible that any degree of those powers should be represented in an idea it is evident there can be no idea of a spirit but it will be objected that if there is no idea signified by the terms soul spirit and substance they are wholly insignificant or have no meaning in them i answer those words do mean or signify a real thing which is neither an idea nor like an idea but that which perceives ideas and wills and reasons about them what i am my self that which i denote by the term i is the same with what is meant by soul or spiritual substance if it be said that this is only quarrelling at a word and that since the immediate significations of other names are by common consent called ideas no reason can be assigned why that which is signified by the name spirit or soul may not partake in the same appellation i answer all the unthinking objects of the mind agree in that they are intirely passive and their existence consists only in being perceived whereas a soul or spirit is an active being whose existence consists not in being perceived but in perceiving ideas and thinking it is therefore necessary in order to prevent equivocation and confounding natures perfectly disagreeing and unlike that we distinguish between spirit and idea see sect in a large sense indeed we may be said to have an idea or rather a notion of spirit that is we understand the meaning of the word otherwise we could not affirm or deny any thing of it moreover as we conceive the ideas that are in the minds of other spirits by means of our own which we suppose to be resemblances of them so we know other spirits by means of our own soul which in that sense is the image or idea of them it having a like respect to other spirits that blueness or heat by me perceived has to those ideas perceived by another it must not be supposed that they who assert the natural immortality of the soul are of opinion that it is absolutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinite power of the creator who first gave it being but only that it is not liable to be broken or dissolved by the ordinary laws of nature or motion they indeed who hold the soul of man to be only a thin vital flame or system of animal spirits make it perishing and corruptible as the body since there is nothing more easily dissipated than such a being which it is naturally impossible should survive the ruin of the tabernacle wherein it is inclosed and this notion hath been greedily embraced and cherished by the worst part of mankind as the most effectual antidote against all impressions of virtue and religion but it hath been made evident that bodies of what frame or texture soever are barely passive ideas in the mind which is more distant and heterogeneous from them than light is from darkness we have shewn that the soul is indivisible incorporeal unextended and it is consequently incorruptible nothing can be plainer than that the motions changes decays and dissolutions which we hourly see befal natural bodies and which is what we mean by the course of nature cannot possibly affect an active simple uncompounded substance such a being therefore is indissoluble by the force of nature that is to say the soul of man is naturally immortal after what hath been said it is i suppose plain that our souls are not to be known in the same manner as senseless inactive objects or by way of idea spirits and ideas are things so wholly different that when we say they exist they are known or the like these words must not be thought to signify any thing common to both natures there is nothing alike or common in them and to expect that by any multiplication or enlargement of our faculties we may be enabled to know a spirit as we do a triangle seems as absurd as if we should hope to see a sound this is inculcated because i imagine it may be of moment towards clearing several important questions and preventing some very dangerous errors concerning the nature of the soul we may not i think strictly be said to have an idea of an active being or of an action although we may be said to have a notion of them i have some knowledge or notion of my mind and its acts about ideas inasmuch as i know or understand what is meant by those words what i know that i have some notion of i will not say that the terms idea and notion may not be used convertibly if the world will have it so but yet it conduceth to clearness and propriety that we distinguish things very different by different names it is also to be remarked that all relations including an act of the mind we cannot so properly be said to have an idea but rather a notion of the relations and habitudes between things but if in the modern way the word idea is extended to spirits and relations and acts this is after all an affair of verbal concern it will not be amiss to add that the doctrine of abstract ideas hath had no small share in rendering those sciences intricate and obscure which are particularly conversant about spiritual things men have imagined they could frame abstract notions of the powers and acts of the mind and consider them prescinded as well from the mind or spirit it self as from their respective objects and effects hence a great number of dark and ambiguous terms presumed to stand for abstract notions have been introduced into metaphysics and morality and from these have grown infinite distractions and disputes amongst the learned but nothing seems more to have contributed towards engaging men in controversies and mistakes with regard to the nature and operations of the mind than the being used to speak of those things in terms borrowed from sensible ideas for example the will is termed the motion of the soul this infuses a belief that the mind of man is as a ball in motion impelled and determined by the objects of sense as necessarily as that is by the stroke of a racket hence arise endless scruples and errors of dangerous consequence in morality all which i doubt not may be cleared and truth appear plain uniform and consistent could but philosophers be prevailed on to retire into themselves and attentively consider their own meaning from what hath been said it is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations or the ideas by them excited in us i perceive several motions changes and combinations of ideas that inform me there are certain particular agents like my self which accompany them and concur in their production hence the knowledge i have of other spirits is not immediate as is the knowledge of my ideas but depending on the intervention of ideas by me referred to agents or spirits distinct from my self as effects or concomitant signs but though there be some things which convince us humane agents are concerned in producing them yet it is evident to every one that those things which are called the works of nature that is the far greater part of the ideas or sensations perceived by us are not produced by or dependent on the wills of men there is therefore some other spirit that causes them since it is repugnant that they should subsist by themselves see sect but if we attentively consider the constant regularity order and concatenation of natural things the surprising magnificence beauty and perfection of the larger and the exquisite contrivance of the smaller parts of creation together with the exact harmony and correspondence of the whole but above all the never enough admired laws of pain and pleasure and the instincts or natural inclinations appetites and passions of animals i say if we consider all these things and at the same time attend to the meaning and import of the attributes one eternal infinitely wise good and perfect we shall clearly perceive that they belong to the aforesaid spirit who works all in all and by whom all things consist hence it is evident that god is known as certainly and immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever distinct from our selves we may even assert that the existence of god is far more evidently perceived than the existence of men because the effects of nature are infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribed to humane agents there is not any one mark that denotes a man or effect produced by him which doth not more strongly evince the being of that spirit who is the author of nature for it is evident that in affecting other persons the will of man hath no other object than barely the motion of the limbs of his body but that such a motion should be attended by or excite any idea in the mind of another depends wholly on the will of the creator he alone it is who upholding all things by the word of his power maintains that intercourse between spirits whereby they are able to perceive the existence of each other and yet this pure and clear light which enlightens every one is it self invisible it seems to be a general pretence of the unthinking herd that they cannot see god could we but see him say they as we see a man we should believe that he is and believing obey his commands but alas we need only open our eyes to see the sovereign lord of all things with a more full and clear view than we do any one of our fellowcreatures not that i imagine we see god as some will have it by a direct and immediate view or see corporeal things not by themselves but by seeing that which represents them in the essence of god which doctrine is i must confess to me incomprehensible but i shall explain my meaning a humane spirit or person is not perceived by sense as not being an idea when therefore we see the colour size figure and motions of a man we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excited in our own minds and these being exhibited to our view in sundry distinct collections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and created spirits like our selves hence it is plain we do not see a man if by man is meant that which lives moves perceives and thinks as we do but only such a certain collection of ideas as directs us to think there is a distinct principle of thought and motion like to our selves accompanying and represented by it and after the same manner we see god all the difference is that whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denotes a particular humane mind whithersoever we direct our view we do at all times and in all places perceive manifest tokens of the divinity every thing we see hear feel or any wise perceive by sense being a sign or effect of the power of god as is our perception of those very motions which are produced by men it is therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that is capable of the least reflexion than the existence of god or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and intire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our being that the discovery of this great truth which lies so near and obvious to the mind should be attained to by the reason of so very few is a sad instance of the stupidity and inattention of men who though they are surrounded with such clear manifestations of the deity are yet so little affected by them that they seem as it were blinded with excess of light but you will say hath nature no share in the production of natural things and must they be all ascribed to the immediate and sole operation of god i answer if by nature is meant only the visible series of effects or sensations imprinted on our minds according to certain fixed and general laws then it is plain that nature taken in this sense cannot produce any thing at all but if by nature is meant some being distinct from god as well as from the laws of nature and things perceived by sense i must confess that word is to me an empty sound without any intelligible meaning annexed to it nature in this acceptation is a vain chimera introduced by those heathens who had not just notions of the omnipresence and infinite perfection of god but it is more unaccountable that it should be received among christians professing belief in the holy scriptures which constantly ascribe those effects to the immediate hand of god that heathen philosophers are wont to impute to nature the lord he causeth the vapours to ascend he maketh lightnings with rain he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures jerem chap ver he turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night amos chap ver he visiteth the earth and maketh it soft with showers he blesseth the springing thereof and crowneth the year with his goodness so that the pastures are clothed with flocks and the valleys are covered over with corn see psalm but notwithstanding that this is the constant language of scripture yet we have i know not what aversion from believing that god concerns himself so nearly in our affairs fain would we suppose him at a great distance off and substitute some blind unthinking deputy in his stead though if we may believe saint paul he be not far from every one of us it will i doubt not be objected that the slow and gradual methods observed in the production of natural things do not seem to have for their cause the immediate hand of an almighty agent besides monsters untimely births fruits blasted in the blossom rains falling in desert places miseries incident to humane life are so many arguments that the whole frame of nature is not immediately actuated and superintended by a spirit of infinite wisdom and goodness but the answer to this objection is in a good measure plain from sect it being visible that the aforesaid methods of nature are absolutely necessary in order to working by the most simple and general rules and after a steady and consistent manner which argues both the wisdom and goodness of god such is the artificial contrivance of this mighty machine of nature that whilst its motions and various phænomena strike on our senses the hand which actuates the whole is it self unperceivable to men of flesh and blood verily saith the prophet thou art a god that hidest thy self isaiah chap ver but though god conceal himself from the eyes of the sensual and lazy who will not be at the least expense of thought yet to an unbiassed and attentive mind nothing can be more plainly legible than the intimate presence of an allwise spirit who fashions regulates and sustains the whole systeme of being it is clear from what we have elsewhere observed that the operating according to general and stated laws is so necessary for our guidance in the affairs of life and letting us into the secret of nature that without it all reach and compass of thought all humane sagacity and design could serve to no manner of purpose it were even impossible there should be any such faculties or powers in the mind see sect which one consideration abundantly outbalances whatever particular inconveniences may thence arise we should further consider that the very blemishes and defects of nature are not without their use in that they make an agreeable sort of variety and augment the beauty of the rest of the creation as shades in a picture serve to set off the brighter and more enlightened parts we would likewise do well to examine whether our taxing the waste of seeds and embryos and accidental destruction of plants and animals before they come to full maturity as an imprudence in the author of nature be not the effect of prejudice contracted by our familiarity with impotent and saving mortals in man indeed a thrifty management of those things which he cannot procure without much pains and industry may be esteemed wisdom but we must not imagine that the inexplicably fine machine of an animal or vegetable costs the great creator any more pains or trouble in its production than a pebble doth nothing being more evident than that an omnipotent spirit can indifferently produce every thing by a mere fiat or act of his will hence it is plain that the splendid profusion of natural things should not be interpreted weakness or prodigality in the agent who produces them but rather be looked on as an argument of the riches of his power as for the mixture of pain or uneasiness which is in the world pursuant to the general laws of nature and the actions of finite imperfect spirits this in the state we are in at present is indispensably necessary to our wellbeing but our prospects are too narrow we take for instance the idea of some one particular pain into our thoughts and account it evil whereas if we enlarge our view so as to comprehend the various ends connexions and dependencies of things on what occasions and in what proportions we are affected with pain and pleasure the nature of humane freedom and the design with which we are put into the world we shall be forced to acknowledge that those particular things which considered in themselves appear to be evil have the nature of good when considered as linked with the whole systeme of beings from what hath been said it will be manifest to any considering person that it is merely for want of attention and comprehensiveness of mind that there are any favourers of atheism or the manichean heresy to be found little and unreflecting souls may indeed burlesque the works of providence the beauty and order whereof they have not capacity or will not be at the pains to comprehend but those who are masters of any justness and extent of thought and are withal used to reflect can never sufficiently admire the divine traces of wisdom and goodness that shine throughout the oeconomy of nature but what truth is there which shineth so strongly on the mind that by an aversion of thought a wilful shutting of the eyes we may not escape seeing it is it therefore to be wondered at if the generality of men who are ever intent on business or pleasure and little used to fix or open the eye of their mind should not have all that conviction and evidence of the being of god which might be expected in reasonable creatures we should rather wonder that men can be found so stupid as to neglect than that neglecting they should be unconvinced of such an evident and momentous truth and yet it is to be feared that too many of parts and leisure who live in christian countries are merely through a supine and dreadful negligence sunk into a sort of atheism since it is downright impossible that a soul pierced and enlightened with a thorough sense of the omnipresence holiness and justice of that almighty spirit should persist in a remorseless violation of his laws we ought therefore earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important points that so we may attain conviction without all scruple that the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good that he is with us and keepeth us in all places whither we go and giveth us bread to eat and raiment to put on that he is present and conscious to our innermost thoughts and that we have a most absolute and immediate dependence on him a clear view of which great truths cannot choose but fill our hearts with an awful circumspection and holy fear which is the strongest incentive to virtue and the best guard against vice for after all what deserves the first place in our studies is the consideration of god and our duty which to promote as it was the main drift and design of my labours so shall i esteem them altogether useless and ineffectual if by what i have said i cannot inspire my readers with a pious sense of the presence of god and having shewn the falseness or vanity of those barren speculations which make the chief employment of learned men the better dispose them to reverence and embrace the salutary truths of the gospel which to know and to practice is the highest perfection of humane nature an essay towards a new theory of vision by george berkeley contents sect design distance of itself invisible remote distance perceived rather by experience than by sense near distance thought to be perceived by the angle of the optic axes difference between this and the former manner of perceiving distance also by diverging rays this depends not on experience these the common accounts but not satisfactory some ideas perceived by the mediation of others no idea which is not itself perceived can be the means of perceiving another distance perceived by means of some other idea those lines and angles mentioned in optics are not themselves perceived hence the mind does not perceive distance by lines and angles also because they have no real existence and because they are insufficient to explain the phenomena the ideas that suggest distance are st the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes betwixt which and distance there is no necessary connection scarce room for mistake in this matter no regard had to the angle of the optic axes judgment of distance made with both eyes the result of experience ndly confusedness of appearance this the occasion of those judgments attributed to diverging rays objection answered what deceives the writers of optics in this matter the cause why one idea may suggest another this applied to confusion and distance thirrdly the straining of the eye the occasions which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it a difficult case proposed by dr barrow as repugnant to all the known theories this case contradicts a received principle in catoptrics it is shown to agree with the principles we have laid down this phenomenon illustrated it confirms the truth of the principle whereby it is explained vision when distinct and when confused the different effects of parallel diverging and converging rays how converging and diverging rays come to suggest the same distance a person extreme purblind would judge aright in the forementioned case lines and angles why useful in optics the not understanding this a cause of mistake a query proposed by mr molyneux in his dioptrics considered one born blind would not at first have any idea of distance by sight this not agreeable to the common principles the proper objects of sight not without the mind nor the images of any thing without the mind this more fully explained in what sense we must be understood to see distance and external things distance and things placed at a distance not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear the ideas of sight more apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch than those of hearing are how this comes to pass strictly speaking we never see and feel the same thing objects of sight twofold mediate and immediate these hard to separate in our thoughts the received accounts of our perceiving magnitude by sight false magnitude perceived as immediately as distance two kinds of sensible extension neither of which is infinitely divisible the tangible magnitude of an object steady the visible not by what means tangible magnitude is perceived by sight this further enlarged on no necessary connection between confusion or faintness of appearance and small or great magnitude the tangible magnitude of an object more heeded than the visible and why an instance of this men do not measure by visible feet or inches no necessary connection between visible and tangible extension greater visible magnitude might signify lesser tangible magnitude the judgments we make of magnitude depend altogether on experience distance and magnitude seen as shame or anger but we are prone to think otherwise and why the moon seems greater in the horizon than in the meridian the cause of this phenomenon assigned the horizontal moon why greater at one time than another the account we have given proved to be true and confirmed by the moons appearing greater in a mist objection answered the way wherein faintness suggests greater magnitude illustrated appearance of the horizontal moon why thought difficult to explain attempts towards the solution of it made by several but in vain the opinion of dr wallis it is shown to be unsatisfactory how lines and angles may be of use in computing apparent magnitudes one born blind being made to see what judgment he would make of magnitude the minimum visible the same to all creatures objection answered the eye at all times perceives the same number of visible points two imperfections in the visive faculty answering to which we may conceive two perfections in neither of these two ways do microscopes improve the sight the case of microscopical eyes considered the sight admirably adapted to the ends of seeing difficulty concerning erect vision the common way of explaining it the same shown to be false not distinguishing between ideas of sight and touch cause of mistake in this matter the case of one born blind proper to be considered such a one might by touch attain to have ideas of upper and lower which modes of situation he would attribute only to things tangible he would not at first sight think anything he saw high or low erect or inverted this illustrated by an example by what means he would come to denominate visible objects high or low etc why he should think those objects highest which are painted on the lowest part of his eye and vice versa how he would perceive by sight the situation of external objects our propension to think the contrary no argument against what has been said objection answer an object could not be known at first sight by the colour nor by the magnitude thereof nor by the figure in the first act of vision no tangible thing would be suggested by sight difficulty proposed concerning number number of things visible would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible number the creature of the mind one born blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do the situation of any object determined with respect only to objects of the same sense no distance great or small between a visible and tangible thing the not observing this cause of difficulty in erect vision which otherwise includes nothing unaccountable what is meant by the picture being inverted cause of mistake in this matter images in the eye not pictures of external objects in what sense they are pictures in this affair we must carefully distinguish between ideas of sight and touch difficult to explain by words the true theory of vision the question whether there is any idea common to sight and touch stated abstract extension inquired into it is incomprehensible abstract extension not the object of geometry the general idea of a triangle considered vacuum or pure space not common to sight and touch there is no idea or kind of idea common to both senses first argument in proof hereof second argument visible figure and extension not distinct ideas from colour third argument confirmation drawn from mr molyneuxs problem of a sphere and a cube published by mr locke which is falsely solved if the common supposition be true more might be said in proof of our tenet but this suffices further reflection on the foregoing problem the same thing doth not affect both sight and touch the same idea of motion not common to sight and touch the way wherein we apprehend motion by sight easily collected from what hath been said qu how visible and tangible ideas came to have the same name if not of the same kind this accounted for without supposing them of the same kind obj that a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle ans that a visible square is fitter than a visible circle to represent a tangible square but it doth not hence follow that a visible square is like a tangible square why we are more apt to confound visible with tangible ideas than other signs with the things signified several other reasons hereof assigned reluctancy in rejecting any opinion no argument of its truth proper objects of vision the language of nature in it there is much admirable and deserving our attention question proposed concerning the object of geometry at first view we are apt to think visible extension the object of geometry visible extension shown not to be the object of geometry words may as well be thought the object of geometry as visible extension it is proposed to inquire what progress an intelligence that could see but not feel might make in geometry he cannot understand those parts which relate to solids and their surfaces and lines generated by their section nor even the elements of plane geometry the proper objects of sight incapable of being managed as geometrical figures the opinion of those who hold plane figures to be the immediate objects of sight considered planes no more the immediate objects of sight than solids difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the abovementioned intelligence the object of geometry its not being sufficiently understood cause of difficulty and useless labour in that science an essay towards a new theory of vision my design is to show the manner wherein we perceive by sight the distance magnitude and situation of objects also to consider the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch and whether there be any idea common to both senses it is i think agreed by all that distance of itself and immediately cannot be seen for distance being a line directed endwise to the eye it projects only one point in the fund of the eye which point remains invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter i find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of objects considerably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded on experience than of sense for example when i perceive a great number of intermediate objects such as houses fields rivers and the like which i have experienced to take up a considerable space i thence form a judgment or conclusion that the object i see beyond them is at a great distance again when an object appears faint and small which at a near distance i have experienced to make a vigorous and large appearance i instantly conclude it to be far off and this it is evident is the result of experience without which from the faintness and littleness i should not have inferred anything concerning the distance of objects but when an object is placed at so near a distance as that the interval between the eyes bears any sensible proportion to it the opinion of speculative men is that the two optic axes the fancy that we see only with one eye at once being exploded concurring at the object do there make an angle by means of which according as it is greater or lesser the object is perceived to be nearer or farther off betwixt which and the foregoing manner of estimating distance there is this remarkable difference that whereas there was no apparent necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance or between great distance and a little and faint appearance there appears a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance and an acute angle and farther distance it does not in the least depend upon experience but may be evidently known by anyone before he had experienced it that the nearer the concurrence of the optic axes the greater the angle and the remoter their concurrence is the lesser will be the angle comprehended by them there is another way mentioned by optic writers whereby they will have us judge of those distances in respect of which the breadth of the pupil hath any sensible bigness and that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which issuing from the visible point do fall on the pupil that point being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging rays and that remoter which is seen by less diverging rays and so on the apparent distance still increasing as the divergency of the rays decreases till at length it becomes infinite when the rays that fall on the pupil are to sense parallel and after this manner it is said we perceive distance when we look only with one eye in this case also it is plain we are not beholding to experience it being a certain necessary truth that the nearer the direct rays falling on the eye approach to a parallelism the farther off is the point of their intersection or the visible point from whence they flow i have here set down the common current accounts that are given of our perceiving near distances by sight which though they are unquestionably received for true by mathematicians and accordingly made use of by them in determining the apparent places of objects do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory and that for these following reasons first it is evident that when the mind perceives any idea not immediately and of itself it must be by the means of some other idea thus for instance the passions which are in the mind of another are of themselves to me invisible i may nevertheless perceive them by sight though not immediately yet by means of the colours they produce in the countenance we often see shame or fear in the looks of a man by perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale moreover it is evident that no idea which is not itself perceived can be the means of perceiving any other idea if i do not perceive the redness or paleness of a mans face themselves it is impossible i should perceive by them the passions which are in his mind now from sect it is plain that distance is in its own nature imperceptible and yet it is perceived by sight it remains therefore that it be brought into view by means of some other idea that is itself immediately perceived in the act of vision but those lines and angles by means whereof some mathematicians pretend to explain the perception of distance are themselves not at all perceived nor are they in truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics i appeal to anyones experience whether upon sight of an object he computes its distance by the bigness of the angle made by the meeting of the two optic axes or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to his pupil everyone is himself the best judge of what he perceives and what not in vain shall all the mathematicians in the world tell me that i perceive certain lines and angles which introduce into my mind the various ideas of distance so long as i myself am conscious of no such thing since therefore those angles and lines are not themselves perceived by sight it follows from sect that the mind doth not by them judge of the distance of objects secondly the truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to anyone that considers those lines and angles have no real existence in nature being only an hypothesis framed by the mathematicians and by them introduced into optics that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way the third and last reason i shall give for rejecting that doctrine is that though we should grant the real existence of those optic angles etc and that it was possible for the mind to perceive them yet these principles would not be found sufficient to explain the phenomena of distance as shall be shown hereafter now it being already shown that distance is suggested to the mind by the mediation of some other idea which is itself perceived in the act of seeing it remains that we inquire what ideas or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we may suppose the ideas of distance are connected and by which they are introduced into the mind and first it is certain by experience that when we look at a near object with both eyes according as it approaches or recedes from us we alter the disposition of our eyes by lessening or widening the interval between the pupils this disposition or turn of the eyes is attended with a sensation which seems to me to be that which in this case brings the idea of greater or lesser distance into the mind not that there is any natural or necessary connection between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes and greater or lesser distance but because the mind has by constant experience found the different sensations corresponding to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended each with a different degree of distance in the object there has grown an habitual or customary connection between those two sorts of ideas so that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceives the different idea of distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation just as upon hearing a certain sound the idea is immediately suggested to the understanding which custom had united with it nor do i see how i can easily be mistaken in this matter i know evidently that distance is not perceived of itself that by consequence it must be perceived by means of some other idea which is immediately perceived and varies with the different degrees of distance i know also that the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes is of itself immediately perceived and various degrees thereof are connected with different distances which never fail to accompany them into my mind when i view an object distinctly with both eyes whose distance is so small that in respect of it the interval between the eyes has any considerable magnitude i know it is a received opinion that by altering the disposition of the eyes the mind perceives whether the angle of the optic axes is made greater or lesser and that accordingly by a kind of natural geometry it judges the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther off but that this is not true i am convinced by my own experience since i am not conscious that i make any such use of the perception i have by the turn of my eyes and for me to make those judgments and draw those conclusions from it without knowing that i do so seems altogether incomprehensible from all which it follows that the judgment we make of the distance of an object viewed with both eyes is entirely the result of experience if we had not constantly found certain sensations arising from the various disposition of the eyes attended with certain degrees of distance we should never make those sudden judgments from them concerning the distance of objects no more than we would pretend to judge a mans thoughts by his pronouncing words we had never heard before secondly an object placed at a certain distance from the eye to which the breadth of the pupil bears a considerable proportion being made to approach is seen more confusedly and the nearer it is brought the more confused appearance it makes and this being found constantly to be so there ariseth in the mind an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and distance the greater confusion still implying the lesser distance and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object this confused appearance of the object doth therefore seem to be the medium whereby the mind judgeth of distance in those cases wherein the most approved writers of optics will have it judge by the different divergency with which the rays flowing from the radiating point fall on the pupil no man i believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angles that the rays are supposed to form according to their various inclinations on his eye but he cannot choose seeing whether the object appear more or less confused it is therefore a manifest consequence from what bath been demonstrated that instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays the mind makes use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appearance thereby to determine the apparent place of an object nor doth it avail to say there is not any necessary connection between confused vision and distance great or small for i ask any man what necessary connection he sees between the redness of a blush and shame and yet no sooner shall he behold that colour to arise in the face of another but it brings into his and the idea of that passion which hath been observed to accompany it what seems to have misled the writers of optics in this matter is that they imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in mathematics betwixt which and the premises it is indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary connection but it is far otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance we are not to think that brutes and children or even grown reasonable men whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration that one idea may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have been observed to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence or without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist of this there are innumerable instances of which no one can be ignorant thus greater confusion having been constantly attended with nearer distance no sooner is the former idea perceived but it suggests the latter to our thoughts and if it had been the ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object were placed the more confused it should appear it is certain the very same perception that now makes us think an object approaches would then have made us to imagine it went farther off that perception abstracting from custom and experience being equally fitted to produce the idea of great distance or small distance or no distance at all thirdly an object being placed at the distance above specified and brought nearer to the eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the appearances growing more confused by straining the eye in which case that sensation supplies the place of confused vision in aiding the mind to judge of the distance of the object it being esteemed so much the nearer by how much the effort or straining of the eye in order to distinct vision is greater i have here set down those sensations or ideas that seem to be the constant and general occasions of introducing into the mind the different ideas of near distance it is true in most cases that divers other circumstances contribute to frame our idea of distance to wit the particular number size kind etc of the things seen concerning which as well as all other the forementioned occasions which suggest distance i shall only observe they have none of them in their own nature any relation or connection with it nor is it possible they should ever signify the various degrees thereof otherwise than as by experience they have been found to be connected with them i shall proceed upon these principles to account for a phenomenon which has hitherto strangely puzzled the writers of optics and is so far from being accounted for by any of their theories of vision that it is by their own confession plainly repugnant to them and of consequence if nothing else could be objected were alone sufficient to bring their credit in question the whole difficulty i shall lay before you in the words of the learned dr barrow with which he concludes his optic lectures i have here delivered what my thoughts have suggested to me concerning that part of optics which is more properly mathematical as for the other parts of that science which being rather physical do consequently abound with plausible conjectures instead of certain principles there has in them scarce anything occurred to my observation different from what has been already said by kepler scheinerus descartes and others and methinks i had better say nothing at all than repeat that which has been so often said by others i think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject but before i quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous dealing that i owe both to you and to truth obligeth me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty which seems directly opposite to the doctrine i have been hitherto inculcating at least admits of no solution from it in short it is this before the double convex glass or concave speculum ebf let the point a be placed at such a distance that the rays proceeding from a after refraction or reflection be brought to unite somewhere in the axab and suppose the point of union ie the image of the point a as hath been already set forth to be z between which and b the vertex of the glass or speculum conceive the eye to be anywhere placed the question now is where the point a ought to appear experience shows that it does not appear behind at the point z and it were contrary to nature that it should since all the impression which affects the sense comes from towards a but from our tenets it should seem to follow that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off so great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance for since if we exclude all anticipations and prejudices every object appears by so much the farther off by how much the rays it sends to the eye are less diverging and that object is thought to be most remote from which parallel rays proceed unto the eye reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a greater distance which is seen by converging rays moreover it may in general be asked concerning this case what it is that determines the apparent place of the point a and maketh it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other times farther off to which doubt i see nothing that can be answered agreeable to the principles we have laid down except only that the point a ought always to appear extremely remote but on the contrary we are assured by experience that the point a appears variously distant according to the different situations of the eye between the points b and z and that it doth never if at all seem farther off than it would if it were beheld by the naked eye but on the contrary it doth sometimes appear much nearer nay it is even certain that by how much the rays falling on the eye do more converge by so much the nearer doth the object seem to approach for the eye being placed close to the point b the object a appears nearly in its own natural place if the point b is taken in the glass or at the same distance if in the speculum the eye being brought back to o the object seems to draw near and being come to p it beholds it still nearer and so on little and little till at length the eye being placed somewhere suppose at q the object appearing extremely near begins to vanish into mere confusion all which doth seem repugnant to our principles at least not rightly to agree with them nor is our tenet alone struck at by this experiment but likewise all others that ever came to my knowledge are every whit as much endangered by it the ancient one especially which is most commonly received and comes nearest to mine seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby that the most learned tacquet has been forced to reject that principle as false and uncertain on which alone he had built almost his whole catoptrics and consequently by taking away the foundation hath himself pulled down the superstructure he had raised on it which nevertheless i do not believe he would have done had he but considered the whole matter more thoroughly and examined the difficulty to the bottom but as for me neither this nor any other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me as to make me renounce that which i know to be manifestly agreeable to reason especially when as it here falls out the difficulty is founded in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular case for in the present case something peculiar lies hid which being involved in the subtilty of nature will perhaps hardly be discovered till such time as the manner of vision is more perfectly made known concerning which i must own i have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least show of probability not to mention certainty i shall therefore leave this knot to be untied by you wishing you may have better success in it than i have had the ancient and received principle which dr barrow here mentions as the main foundation of tacquets catoptrics is that every visible point seen by reflection from a speculum shall appear placed at the intersection of the reflected ray and the perpendicular of incidence which intersection in the present case happening to be behind the eye it greatly shakes the authority of that principle whereon the aforementioned author proceeds throughout his whole catoptrics in determining the apparent place of objects seen by reflection from any kind of speculum let us now see how this phenomenon agrees with our tenets the eye the nearer it is placed to the point b in the foregoing figures the more distinct is the appearance of the object but as it recedes to o the appearance grows more confused and at p it sees the object yet more confused and so on till the eye being brought back to z sees the object in the greatest confusion of all wherefore by sect the object should seem to approach the eye gradually as it recedes from the point b that is at o it should in consequence of the principle i have laid down in the aforesaid section seem nearer than it did at b and at p nearer than at o and at q nearer than at p and so on till it quite vanishes at z which is the very matter of fact as anyone that pleases may easily satisfy himself by experiment this case is much the same as if we should suppose an englishman to meet a foreigner who used the same words with the english but in a direct contrary signification the englishman would not fail to make a wrong judgment of the ideas annexed to those sounds in the mind of him that used them just so in the present case the object speaks if i may so say with words that the eye is well acquainted with that is confusions of appearance but whereas heretofore the greater confusions were always wont to signify nearer distances they have in this case a direct contrary signification being connected with the greater distances whence it follows that the eye must unavoidably be mistaken since it will take the confusions in the sense it has been used to which is directly opposed to the true this phenomenon as it entirely subverts the opinion of those who will have us judge of distance by lines and angles on which supposition it is altogether inexplicable so it seems to me no small confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it is explained but in order co a more full explication of this point and to show how far the hypothesis of the minds judging by the various divergency of rays may be of use in determining the apparent place of an object it will be necessary to premise some few things which are already well known to those who have any skill in dioptrics first any radiating point is then distinctly seen when the rays proceeding from it are by the refractive power of the crystalline accurately reunited in the retina or fund of the eye but if they are reunited either before they arrive at the retina or after they have passed it then there is confused vision secondly suppose in the adjacent figures np represent an eye duly framed and retaining its natural figure in fig the rays falling nearly parallel on the eye are by the crystalline ab refracted so as their focus or point of union f falls exactly on the retina but if the rays fall sensibly diverging on the eye as in fig then their focus falls beyond the retina or if the rays are made to converge by the lens qs before they come at the eye as in fig their focus f will fall before the retina in which two last cases it is evident from the foregoing section that the appearance of the point z is confused and by how much the greater is the convergency or divergency of the rays falling on the pupil by so much the farther will the point of their reunion be from the retina either before or behind it and consequently the point z will appear by so much the more confused and this by the bye may show us the difference between confused and faint vision confused vision is when the rays proceedings from each distinct point of the object are not accurately recollected in one corresponding point on the retina but take up some space thereon so that rays from different points become mixed and confused together this is opposed to a distinct vision and attends near objects faint vision is when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few rays arrive from the object to the eye this is opposed to vigorous or clear vision and attends remote objects but to return the eye or to speak truly the mind perceiving only the confusion itself without ever considering the cause from which it proceeds doth constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion whether that confusion be occasioned by converging or by diverging rays it matters not whence it follows that the eye viewing the object z through the glass qs which by refraction causeth the rays zq zs etc to converge should judge it to be at such a nearness at which if it were placed it would radiate on the eye with rays diverging to that degree as would produce the same confusion which is now produced by converging rays ie would cover a portion of the retina equal to dc vid fig supra but then this must be understood to use dr barrows phrase seclusis praenotionibus et praejudiciis in case we abstract from all other circumstances of vision such as the figure size faintness etc of the visible objects all which do ordinarily concur to form our idea of distance the mind having by frequent experience observed their several sorts or degrees to be connected with various distances it plainly follows from what hath been said that a person perfectly purblind ie that could not see an object distinctly but when placed close to his eye would not make the same wrong judgment that others do in the forementioned case for to him greater confusions constantly suggesting greater distances he must as he recedes from the glass and the object grows more confused judge it to be at a farther distance contrary to what they do who have had the perception of the objects growing more confused connected with the idea of approach hence also it doth appear there may be good use of computation by lines and angles in optics not that the mind judgeth of distance immediately by them but because it judgeth by somewhat which is connected with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient thus the mind judging of the distance of an object by the confusedness of its appearance and this confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked eye according as the object is seen by rays more or less diverging it follows that a man may make use of the divergency of the rays in computing the apparent distance though not for its own sake yet on account of the confusion with which it is connected but so it is the confusion itself is entirely neglected by mathematicians as having no necessary relation with distance such as the greater or lesser angles of divergency are conceived to have and these especially for that they fall under mathematical computation are alone regarded in determining the apparent places of objects as though they were the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind makes of distance whereas in truth they should not at all be regarded in themselves or any otherwise than as they are supposed to be the cause of confused vision the not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing oversight for proof whereof we need go no farther than the case before us it having been observed that the most diverging rays brought into the mind the idea of nearest distance and that still as the divergency decreased the distance increased and it being thought the connexion between the various degrees of divergency and distance was immediate this naturally leads one to conclude from an illgrounded analogy that converging rays shall make an object appear at an immense distance and that as the convergency increases the distance if it were possible should do so likewise that this was the cause of dr barrows mistake is evident from his own words which we have quoted whereas had the learned doctor observed that diverging and converging rays how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in producing the same effect to wit confusedness of vision greater degrees whereof are produced indifferently either as the divergency or convergency and the rays increaseth and that it is by this effect which is the same in both that either the divergency or convergency is perceived by the eye i say had he but considered this it is certain he would have made a quite contrary judgment and rightly concluded that those rays which fall on the eye with greater degrees of convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer but it is plain it was impossible for any man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he had regard only to lines and angles and did not apprehend the true nature of vision and how far it was of mathematical consideration before we dismiss this subject it is fit we take notice of a query relating thereto proposed by the ingenious mr molyneux is his treatise of dioptricspar i prop sect where speaking of this difficulty he has these words and so he ie dr barrow leaves this difficulty to the solution of others which i after so great an example shall do likewise but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doarine which we have before laid down for determining the locus objecti on account of being pressed by one difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by mortals in the meantime i propose it to the consideration of the ingenious whether the locus apparens of an object placed as in this th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base is behind the eye to which query we may venture to answer in the negative for in the present case the rule for determining the distance of the distinct base or respective focus from the glass is this as the difference between the distance of the object and focus is to the focus or focal length so the distance of the object from the glass is to the distance of the respective focus or distinct base from the glass molyneux dioptr par i prop let us now suppose the object to be placed at the distance of the focal length and one half of the focal length from the glass and the eye close to the glass hence it will follow by the rule that the distance of the distinct base behind the eye is double the true distance of the object before the eye if therefore mr molyneuxs conjecture held good it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really is and in other cases at three or four times its due distance or more but this manifestly contradicts experience the object never appearing at farthest beyond its due distance whatever therefore is built on this supposition vid corol i prop ibid comes to the ground along with it from what hath been premised it is a manifest consequence that a man born blind being made to see would at first have no idea of distance by sight the sun and stars the remotest objects as well as the nearer would all seem to be in his eye or rather in his mind the objects intromitted by sight would seem to him as in truth they are no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations each whereof is as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure or the most inward passions of his soul for our judging objects provided by sight to be at any distance or without the mind is vid sect entirely the effect of experience which one in those circumstances could not yet have attained to it is indeed otherwise upon the common supposition that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic axes just as one in the dark or a blindman by the angle comprehended by two sticks one whereof he held in each hand for if this were true it would follow that one blind from his birth being made to see should stand in need of no new experience in order to perceive distance by sight but that this is false has i think been sufficiently demonstrated and perhaps upon a strict inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their birth have grown up in a continued habit of seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side to wit in thinking what they see to be at a distance from them for at this time it seems agreed on all hands by those who have had any thoughts of that matter that colours which are the proper and immediate object of sight are not without the mind but then it will be said by sight we have also the ideas of extension and figure and motion all which may well be thought without and at some distance from the mind though colour should not in answer to this i appeal to any mans experience whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the colour of that object nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place is not the extension we see coloured and is it possible for us so much as in thought to separate and abstract colour from extension now where the extension is there surely is the figure and there the motion too i speak of those which are perceived by sight but for a fuller explication of this point and to show that the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things placed at a distance it is requisite that we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what is meant in common discourse when one says that which he sees is at a distance from him suppose for example that looking at the moon i should say it were fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me let us see what moon this is spoken of it is plain it cannot be the visible moon or anything like the visible moon or that which i see which is only a round luminous plane of about thirty visible points in diameter for in case i am carried from the place where i stand directly towards the moon it is manifest the object varies still as i go on and by the time that i am advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth i shall be so far from being near a small round luminous flat that i shall perceive nothing like it this object having long since disappeared and if i would recover it it must be by going back to the earth from whence i set out again suppose i perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of something which i doubt whether it be a man or a tree or a tower but judge it to be at the distance of about a mile it is plain i cannot mean that what i see is a mile off or that it is the image or likeness of anything which is a mile off since that every step i take towards it the appearance alters and from being obscure small and faint grows clear large and vigorous and when i come to the miles end that which i saw first is quite lost neither do i find anything in the likeness of it in these and the like instances the truth of the matter stands thus having of a long time experienced certain ideas perceivable by touch as distance tangible figure and solidity to have been connected with certain ideas of sight i do upon perceiving these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are by the wonted ordinary course of nature like to follow looking at an object i perceive a certain visible figure and colour with some degree of faintness and other circumstances which from what i have formerly observed determine me to think that if i advance forward so many paces or miles i shall be affected with such and such ideas of touch so that in truth and strictness of speech i neither see distance itself nor anything that i take to be at a distance i say neither distance nor things placed at a distance are themselves or their ideas truly perceived by sight this i am persuaded of as to what concerns myself and i believe whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts and examine what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his understanding that after having passed a certain distance to be measured by the motion of his body which is perceivable by touch he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas but that one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense and that there is no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas suggested by them we need go no farther than the next lookingglass or pictures to be convinced note that when i speak of tangible ideas i take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understanding in which large signification it is commonly used by the moderns from what we have shown it is a manifest consequence that the ideas of space outness and things placed at a distance are not strictly speaking the object of sight they are not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear sitting in my study i hear a coach drive along the street i look through the casement and see it i walk out and enter into it thus common speech would incline one to think i heard saw and touched the same thing to wit the coach it is nevertheless certain the ideas intromitted by each sense are widely different and distinct from each other but having been observed constantly to go together they are spoken of as one and the same thing by the variation of the noise i perceive the different distances of the coach and know that it approaches before i look out thus by the ear i perceive distance just after the same manner as i do by the eye i do not nevertheless say i hear distance in like manner as i say that i see it the ideas perceived by hearing not being so apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch as those of sight are so likewise a man is easily convinced that bodies and external things are not properly the object of hearing but only sounds by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that body or distance is suggested to his thoughts but then one is with more difficulty brought to discern the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch though it be certain a man no more sees and feels the same thing than he hears and feels the same thing one reason of which seems to be this it is thought a great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one extension and one figure but the extension and figure of a body being let into the mind two ways and that indifferently either by sight or touch it seems to follow that we see the same extension and the same figure which we feel but if we take a close and accurate view of things it must be acknowledged that we never see and feel one and the same object that which is seen is one thing and that which is felt is another if the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible figure and extension we are not to infer that one and the same thing has divers extensions the true consequence is that the objects of sight and touch are two distinct things it may perhaps require some thought rightly to conceive this distinction and the difficulty seems not a little increased because the combination of visible ideas hath constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it is connected which doth of necessity arise from the use and end of language in order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision we must bear in mind that there are two sorts of objects apprehended by the eye the one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former those of the first sort neither are nor appear to be without the mind or at any distance off they may indeed grow greater or smaller more confused or more clear or more faint but they do not cannot approach or recede from us whenever we say an object is at a distance whenever we say it draws near or goes farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the touch and are not so truly perceived as suggested by the eye in like manner as thoughts by the ear no sooner do we hear the words of a familiar language pronounced in our ears but the ideas corresponding thereto present themselves to our minds in the very same instant the sound and the meaning enter the understanding so closely are they united that it is not in our power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also we even act in all respects as if we heard the very thoughts themselves so likewise the secondary objects or those which are only suggested by sight do often more strongly affect us and are more regarded than the proper objects of that sense along with which they enter into the mind and with which they have a far more strict connexion than ideas have with words hence it is we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate objects of sight and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter they are as it were most closely twisted blended and incorporated together and the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time by the use of language and want of reflexion however i believe anyone that shall attentively consider what we have already said and shall say upon this subject before we have done especially if he pursue it in his own thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice sure i am it is worth some attention to whoever would understand the true nature of vision i have now done with distance and proceed to show how it is that we perceive by sight the magnitude of objects it is the opinion of some that we do it by angles or by angles in conjunction with distance but neither angles nor distance being perceivable by sight and the things we see being in truth at no distance from us it follows that as we have shown lines and angles not to be the medium the mind makes use of in apprehending the apparent place so neither are they the medium whereby it apprehends the apparent magnitude of objects it is well known that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a greater angle and at a farther distance a lesser angle and by this principle we are told the mind estimates the magnitude of an object comparing the angle under which it is seen with its distance and thence inferring the magnitude thereof what inclines men to this mistake beside the humour of making one see by geometry is that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest magnitude but if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former i say they do not first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance and suggest magnitude as independently of distance as they do distance independently of magnitude all which will be evident to whoever considers what hath been already said and what follows it hath been shown there are two sorts of objects apprehended by sight each whereof hath its distinct magnitude or extension the one properly tangible ie to be perceived and measured by touch and not immediately falling under the sense of seeing the other properly and immediately visible by mediation of which the former is brought in view each of these magnitudes are greater or lesser according as they contain in them more or fewer points they being made up of points or minimums for whatever may be said of extension in abstract it is certain sensible extension is not infinitely divisible there is a minimum tangibile and a minimum visibile beyond which sense cannot perceive this everyones experience will inform him the magnitude of the object which exists without the mind and is at a distance continues always invariably the same but the visible object still changing as you approach to or recede from the tangible object it hath no fixed and determinate greatness whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of anything for instance a tree or a house we must mean the tangible magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity spoken of it but though the tangible and visible magnitude in truth belong to two distinct objects i shall nevertheless especially since those objects are called by the same name and are observed to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech sometimes speak of them as belonging to one and the same thing now in order to discover by what means the magnitude of tangible objects is perceived by sight i need only reflect on what passes in my own mind and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my thoughts when i look on any object and these i find to be first the magnitude or extension of the visible object which being immediately perceived by sight is connected with that other which is tangible and placed at a distance secondly the confusion or distinctness and thirdly the vigorousness or faintness of the aforesaid visible appearance ceteris paribus by how much the greater or lesser the visible object is by so much the greater or lesser do i conclude the tangible object to be but be the idea immediately perceived by sight never so large yet if it be withal confused i judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small if it be distinct and clear i judge it greater and if it be faint i apprehend it to be yet greater what is here meant by confusion and faintness hath been explained in sect moreover the judgments we make of greatness do in like manner as those of distance depend on the disposition of the eye also on the figure number and situation of objects and other circumstances that have been observed to attend great or small tangible magnitudes thus for instance the very same quantity of visible extension which in the figure of a tower doth suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude that this is owing to the experience we have had of the usual bigness of a tower and a man no one i suppose need be told it is also evident that confusion or faintness have no more a necessary connexion with little or great magnitude than they have with little or great distance as they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our minds and by consequence if it were not for experience we should no more judge a faint or confused appearance to be connected with great or little magnitude than we should that it was connected with great or little distance nor will it be found that great or small visible magnitude hath any necessary relation to great or small tangible magnitude so that the one may certainly be inferred from the other but before we come to the proof of this it is fit we consider the difference there is betwixt the extension and figure which is the proper object of touch and that other which is termed visible and how the former is principally though not immediately taken notice of when we look at any object this has been before mentioned but we shall here inquire into the cause thereof we regard the objects that environ us in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or injure our own bodies and thereby produce in our minds the sensation of pleasure or pain now bodies operating on our organs by an immediate application and the hurt or advantage arising therefrom depending altogether on the tangible and not at all on the visible qualities of any object this is a plain reason why those should be regarded by us much more than these and for this end the visive sense seems to have been bestowed on animals to wit that by the perception of visible ideas which in themselves are not capable of affecting or any wise altering the frame of their bodies they may be able to foresee from the experience they have had what tangible ideas are connected with such and such visible ideas and damage or benefit which is like to ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance which foresight how necessary it is to the preservation of an animal everyones experience can inform him hence it is that when we look at an object the tangible figure and extension thereof are principally attended to whilst there is small heed taken of the visible figure and magnitude which though more immediately perceived do less concern us and are not fitted to produce any alteration in our bodies that the matter of fact is true will be evident to anyone who considers that a man placed at ten foot distance is thought as great as if he were placed at a distance only of five foot which is true not with relation to the visible but tangible greatness of the object the visible magnitude being far greater at one station than it is at the other inches feet etc are settled stated lengths whereby we measure objects and estimate their magnitude we say for example an object appears to be six inches or six foot long now that this cannot be meant of visible inches etc is evident because a visible inch is itself no constant determinate magnitude and cannot therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of any other thing take an inch marked upon a ruler view it successively at the distance of half a foot a foot a foot and a half etc from the eye at each of which and at all the intermediate distances the inch shall have a different visible extension ie there shall be more or fewer points discerned in it now i ask which of all these various extensions is that stated determinate one that is agreed on for a common measure of other magnitudes no reason can be assigned why we should pitch on one more than another and except there be some invariable determinate extension fixed on to be marked to the word inch it is plain it can be used to little purpose and to say a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more than that it is extended without bringing any particular idea of that extension into the mind farther an inch and a foot from different distances shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times greater than the other from all which it is manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of objects by sight are altogether in reference to their tangible extension whenever we say an object is great or small of this or that determinate measure i say it must be meant of the tangible and not the visible extension which though immediately perceived is nevertheless little taken notice of now that there is no necessary connexion between these two distinct extensions is evident from hence because our eyes might have been framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were less than the minimum tangibile in which case it is not impossible we might have perceived all the immediate objects of sight the very same that we do now but unto those visible appearances there would not be connected those different tangible magnitudes that are now which shows the judgments we make of the magnitude of things placed at a distance from the various greatness of the immediate objects of sight do not arise from any essential or necessary but only a customary tie which has been observed between them moreover it is not only certain that any idea of sight might not have been connected with this or that idea of touch which we now observe to accompany it but also that the greater visible magnitudes might have been connected with and introduced into our minds lesser tangible magnitudes and the lesser visible magnitudes greater tangible magnitudes nay that it actually is so we have daily experience that object which makes a strong and large appearance not seeming near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof is much less but more faint and the appearance upper or which is the same thing painted lower on the retina which faintness and situation suggest both greater magnitude and greater distance from which and from sect and it is manifest that as we do not perceive the magnitudes of objects immediately by sight so neither do we perceive them by the mediation of anything which has a necessary connexion with them those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes of external objects before we touch them might possibly have suggested no such thing or they might have signified them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might as well have served to make us conclude it great those ideas being in their own nature equally fitted to bring into our minds the idea of small or great or no size at all of outward objects just as the words of any language are in their own nature indifferent to signify this or that thing or nothing at all as we see distance so we see magnitude and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the looks of a man those passions are themselves invisible they are nevertheless let in by the eye along with colours and alterations of countenance which are the immediate object of vision and which signify them for no other reason than barely because they have been observed to accompany them without which experience we should no more have taken blushing for a sign of shame than of gladness we are nevertheless exceeding prone to imagine those things which are perceived only by the mediation of others to be themselves the immediate objects of sight or at least to have in their own nature a fitness to be suggested by them before ever they had been experienced to coexist with them from which prejudice everyone perhaps will not find it easy to emancipate himself by any but the clearest convictions of reason and there are some grounds to think that if there was one only invariable and universal languages in the world and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it it would be the opinion of many that the ideas of other mens minds were properly perceived by the ear or had at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds that were affixed to them all which seems to arise from want of a due application of our discerning faculty thereby to discriminate between the ideas that are in our understandings and consider them apart from each other which would preserve us from confounding those that are different and make us see what ideas do and what do not include or imply this or that other idea there is a celebrated phenomenon the solution whereof i shall attempt to give by the principles that have been laid down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects the apparent magnitude of the moon when placed in the horizon is much greater than when it is in the meridian though the angle under which the diameter of the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in the latter and the horizontal moon doth not constantly appear of the same bigness but at some times seemeth far greater than at others now in order to explain the reason of the moons appearing greater than ordinary in the horizon it must be observed that the particles which compose our atmosphere intercept the rays of light proceeding from any object to the eye and by how much the greater is the portion of atmosphere interjacent between the object and the eye by so much the more are the rays intercepted and by consequence the appearance of the object rendered more faint every object appearing more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it sendeth more or fewer rays into the eye now between the eye and the moon when situated in the horizon there lies a far greater quantity of atmosphere than there does when the moon is in the meridian whence it comes to pass that the appearance of the horizontal moon is fainter and therefore by sect it should be thought bigger in that situation than in the meridian or in any other elevation above the horizon farther the air being variously impregnated sometimes more and sometimes less with vapours and exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the rays of light it follows that the appearance of the horizontal moon hath not always an equal faintness and by consequence that luminary though in the very same situation is at one time judged greater than at another that we have here given the true account of the phenomena of the horizontal moon will i suppose be farther evident to anyone from the following considerations first it is plain that which in this case suggests the idea of greater magnitude must be something which is itself perceived for that which is unperceived cannot suggest to our perception any other thing secondly it must be something that does not constantly remain the same but is subject to some change or variation since the appearance of the horizontal moon varies being at one time greater than at another and yet thirdly it cannot be the visible figure or magnitude since that remains the same or is rather lesser by how much the moon is nearer to the horizon it remains therefore that the true cause is that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceeds from the greater paucity of rays arriving at the eye and which i term faintness since this answers all the forementioned conditions and i am not conscious of any other perception that doth add to this that in misty weather it is a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon is far larger than usual which greatly conspires with and strengthens our opinion neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have said if the horizontal moon should chance sometimes to seem enlarged beyond its usual extent even in more serene weather for we must not only have regard to the mist which happens to be in the place where we stand we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapours and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon all which cooperating to render the appearance of the moon more faint and thereby increase its magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually does even in the horizontal position at a time when though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the place where we stand yet the air between the eye and the moon taken all together may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed vapours and exhalations than at other times it may be objected that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque which may intercept a great part of the rays of light should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it is viewed in the horizon to which i answer it is not faintness anyhow applied that suggests greater magnitude there being no necessary but only an experimental connexion between those two things it follows that the faintness which enlarges the appearance must be applied in such sort and with such circumstances as have been observed to attend the vision of great magnitudes when from a distance we behold great objects the particles of the intermediate air and vapours which are themselves unperceivable do interrupt the rays of light and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid now faintness of appearance caused in this sort hath been experienced to coexist with great magnitude but when it is caused by the interposition of an opaque sensible body this circumstance alters the case so that a faint appearance this way caused doth not suggest greater magnitude because it hath not been experienced to coexist with it faintness as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance doth it in the same way that words suggest the notions to which they are annexed now it is known a word pronounced with certain circumstances or in a certain context with other words hath not always the same import and signification that it hath when pronounced in some other circumstances or different context of words the very same visible appearance as to faintness and all other respects if placed on high shall not suggest the same magnitude that it would if it were seen at an equal distance on a level with the eye the reason whereof is that we are rarely accustomed to view objects at a great height our concerns lie among things situated rather before than above us and accordingly our eyes are not placed on the top of our heads but in such a position as is most convenient for us to see distant objects standing in our way and this situation of them being a circumstance which usually attends the vision of distant objects we may from hence account for what is commonly observed an objects appearing of different magnitude even with respect to its horizontal extension on the top of a steeple for example an hundred feet high to one standing below from what it would if placed at an hundred feet distance on a level with his eye for it hath been shown that the judgment we make on the magnitude of a thing depends not on the visible appearance alone but also on divers other circumstances any one of which being omitted or varied may suffice to make some alteration in our judgment hence the circumstances of viewing a distant object in such a situation as is usual and suits with the ordinary posture of the head and eyes being omitted and instead thereof a different situation of the object which requires a different posture of the head taking place it is not to be wondered at if the magnitude be judged different but it will be demanded why an high object should constantly appear less than an equidistant low object of the same dimensions for so it is observed to be it may indeed be granted that the variation of some circumstances may vary the judgment made on the magnitude of high objects which we are less used to look at but it does not hence appear why they should be judged less rather than greater i answer that in case the magnitude of distant objects was suggested by the extent of their visible appearance alone and thought proportional thereto it is certain they would then be judged much less than now they seem to be vide sect but several circumstances concurring to form the judgment we make on the magnitude of distant objects by means of which they appear far larger than others whose visible appearance hath an equal or even greater extension it follows that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which are wont to attend the vision of distant objects and so come to influence the judgments made on their magnitude they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would for any of those things that caused an object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible extension being either omitted or applied without the usual circumstances the judgment depends more entirely on the visible extension and consequently the object must be judged less thus in the present case the situation of the thing seen being different from what it usually is in those objects we have occasion to view and whose magnitude we observe it follows that the very same object being an hundred feet high should seem less than if it was an hundred feet off on or nearly on a level with the eye what has been here set forth seems to me to have no small share in contributing to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon and deserves not to be passed over in the explication of it if we attentively consider the phenomenon before us we shall find the not discerning between the mediate and immediate objects of sight to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occurs in the explication of it the magnitude of the visible moon or that which is the proper and immediate object of vision is not greater when the moon is in the horizon than when it is in the meridian how comes it therefore to seem greater in one situation than the other what is it can put this cheat on the understanding it has no other perception of the moon than what it gets by sight and that which is seen is of the same extent i say the visible appearance hath the same or rather a less magnitude when the moon is viewed in the horizontal than when in the meridional position and yet it is esteemed greater in the former than in the latter herein consists the difficulty which doth vanish and admit of a most easy solution if we consider that as the visible moon is not greater in the horizon than in the meridian so neither is it thought to be so it hath been already shown that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely or in itself is little taken notice of the mind still carrying its view from that to some tangible ideas which have been observed to be connected with it and by that means come to be suggested by it so that when a thing is said to appear great or small or whatever estimate be made of the magnitude of any thing this is meant not of the visible but of the tangible object this duly considered it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seeming contradiction there is that the moon should appear of a different bigness the visible magnitude thereof remaining still the same for by sect the very same visible extension with a different faintness shall suggest a different tangible extension when therefore the horizontal moon is said to appear greater than the meridional moon this must be understood not of a greater visible extension but a of greater tangible or real extension which by reason of the more than ordinary faintness of the visible appearance is suggested to the mind along with it many attempts have been made by learned men to account for this appearance gassendus descartes hobbes and several others have employed their thoughts on that subject but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavours have been is sufficiently shown in the transactionsphil trans num p where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confuted not without some surprize at the gross blunders that ingenious men have been forced into by endeavouring to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary principles of optics since the writing of which there hath been published in the transactions numb p another paper relating to the same affair by the celebrated dr wallis wherein he attempts to account for that phenomenon which though it seems not to contain anything new or different from what had been said before by others i shall nevertheless consider in this place his opinion in short is this we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the visual angle alone but by the visual angle in conjunction with the distance hence though the angle remain the same or even become less yet if withal the distance seem to have been increased the object shall appear greater now one way whereby we estimate the distance of anything is by the number and extent of the intermediate objects when therefore the moon is seen in the horizon the variety of fields houses etc together with the large prospect of the wide extended land or sea that lies between the eye and the utmost limb of the horizon suggest unto the mind the idea of greater distance and consequently magnify the appearance and this according to dr wallis is the true account of the extraordinary largeness attributed by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtended by its diameter is not one jot greater than it used to be with reference to this opinion not to repeat what hath been already said concerning distance i shall only observe first that if the prospect of interjacent objects be that which suggests the idea of farther distance and this idea of farther distance be the cause that brings into the mind the idea of greater magnitude it should hence follow that if one looked at the horizontal moon from behind a wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary for in that case the wall interposing cuts off all that prospect of sea and land etc which might otherwise increase the apparent distance and thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon nor will it suffice to say the memory doth even then suggest all that extent of land etc which lies within the horizon which suggestion occasions a sudden judgment of sense that the moon is farther off and larger than usual for ask any man who from such a station beholding the horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual whether he hath at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate objects or long tract of land that lies between his eye and the extreme edge of the horizon and whether it be that idea which is the cause of his making the aforementioned judgment he will i suppose reply in the negative and declare the horizontal moon shall appear greater than the meridional though he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it secondly it seems impossible by this hypothesis to account for the moons appearing in the very same situation at one time greater than at another which nevertheless has been shown to be very agreeable to the principles we have laid down and receives a most easy and natural explication from them for the further clearing up of this point it is to be observed that what we immediately and properly see are only lights and colours in sundry situations and shades and degrees of faintness and clearness confusion and distinctness all which visible objects are only in the mind nor do they suggest ought external whether distance or magnitude otherwise than by habitual connexion as words do things we are also to remark that beside the straining of the eyes and beside the vivid and faint the distinct and confused appearances which bearing some proportion to lines and angles have been substituted instead of them in the foregoing part of this treatise there are other means which suggest both distance and magnitude particularly the situation of visible points of objects as upper or lower the one suggesting a farther distance and greater magnitude the other a nearer distance and lesser magnitude all which is an effect only of custom and experience there being really nothing intermediate in the line of distance between the uppermost and lowermost which are both equidistant or rather at no distance from the eye as there is also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connexion should suggest greater or lesser magnitude now as these customary experimental means of suggesting distance do likewise suggest magnitude so they suggest the one as immediately as the other i say they do not vide sect first suggest distance and then leave the mind from thence to infer or compute magnitude jut suggest magnitude as immediately and directly as they suggest distance this phenomenon of the horizontal moon is a clear instance of the insufficiency of lines and angles for explaining the way wherein the mind perceives and estimates the magnitude of outward objects there is nevertheless a use of computation by them in order to determine the apparent magnitude of things so far as they have a connexion with and are proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which are the true and immediate occasions that suggest to the mind the apparent magnitude of things but this in general may i think be observed concerning mathematical computation in optics that it can never be very precise and exact since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do often depend on several circumstances which are not proportionable to or capable of being defined by lines and angles from what has been said we may safely deduce this consequence to wit that a man born blind and made to see would at first opening of his eyes make a very different judgment of the magnitude of objects intromitted by them from what others do he would not consider the ideas of sight with reference to or as having any connexion with the ideas of touch his view of them being entirely terminated within themselves he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible points now it being certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from view only one other visible point it follows that whatever object intercepts the view of another hath an equal number of visible points with it and consequently they shall both be thought by him to have the same magnitude hence it is evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb with which he might hide a tower or hinder its being seen equal to that tower or his hand the interposition whereof might conceal experimental means the firmament from his view equal to the firmament how great an inequality soever there may in our apprehensions seem to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close connexion that has grown up in our minds between the objects of sight and touch whereby the very different and distinct ideas of those two senses are so blended and confounded together as to be mistaken for one and the same thing out of which prejudice we cannot easily extricate ourselves for the better explaining the nature of vision and setting the manner wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light i shall proceed to make some observations concerning matters relating thereto whereof the want of reflexion and duly separating between tangible and visible ideas is apt to create in us mistaken and confused notions and first i shall observe that the minimum visibile is exactly equal in all beings whatsoever that are endowed with the visive faculty no exquisite formation of the eye no peculiar sharpness of sight can make it less in one creature than in another for it not being distinguishable into parts nor in any wise a consisting of them it must necessarily be the same to all for suppose it otherwise and that the minimum visibile of a mite for instance be less than the minimum visibile of a man the latter therefore may by detraction of some part be made equal to the former it doth therefore consist of parts which is inconsistent with the notion of a minimum visibile or point it will perhaps be objected that the minimum visibile of a man doth really and in itself contain parts whereby it surpasses that of a mite though they are not perceivable by the man to which i answer the minimum visibile having in like manner as all other the proper and immediate objects of sight been shown not to have any existence without the mind of him who sees it it follows there cannot be any pan of it that is not actually perceived and therefore visible now for any object to contain distinct visible parts and at the same time to be a minimum visibile is a manifest contradiction of these visible points we see at all times an equal number it is every whit as great when our view is contracted and bounded by near objects as when it is extended to larger and remoter for it being impossible that one minimum visibile should obscure or keep out of sight mote than one other it is a plain consequence that when my view is on all sides bounded by the walls of my study see just as many visible points as i could in case that by the removal of the studywalls and all other obstructions i had a full prospect of the circumjacent fields mountains sea and open firmament for so long as i am shut up within the walls by their interposition every point of the external objects is covered from my view but each point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from sight one only other corresponding point it follows that whilst my sight is confined to those narrow walls i see as many points or minima visibilia as i should were those walls away by looking on all the external objects whose prospect is intercepted by them whenever therefore we are said to have a greater prospect at one time than another this must be understood with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate objects of vision which as hath been shown properly belong to the touch the visive faculty considered with reference to its immediate objects may be found to labour of two defects first in respect of the extent or number of visible points that are at once perceivable by it which is narrow and limited to a certain degree it can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of minima visibilia beyond which it cannot extend its prospect secondly our sight is defective in that its view is not only narrow but also for the most part confused of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly and the more we fix our sight on any one object by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear corresponding to these two defects of sight we may imagine as many perfections to wit st that of comprehending in one view a greater number of visible points dly of being able to view them all equally and at once with the utmost clearness and distinction that those perfections are not actually in some intelligences of a different order and capacity from ours it is impossible for us to know in neither of those two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of sight for when we look through a microscope we neither see more visible points nor are the collateral points more distinct than when we look with the naked eye at objects placed in a due distance a microscope brings us as it were into a new world it presents us with a new scene of visible objects quite different from what we behold with the naked eye but herein consists the most remarkable difference to wit that whereas the objects perceived by the eye alone have a certain connexion with tangible objects whereby we are taught to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant objects to the parts of our own body which much conduceth to its preservation there is not the like connexion between things tangible and those visible objects that are perceived by help of a fine microscope hence it is evident that were our eyes turned into the nature of microscopes we should not be much benefited by the change we should be deprived of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by the visive faculty and have left us only the empty amusement of seeing without any other benefit arising from it but in that case it will perhaps be said our sight would be endued with a far greater sharpness and penetration than it now hath but it is certain from what we have already shown that the minimum visibile is never greater or lesser but in all cases constantly the same and in the case of microscopical eyes i see only this difference to wit that upon the ceasing of a certain observable connexion betwixt the divers perceptions of sight and touch which before enabled us to regulate our actions by the eye it would now be rendered utterly unserviceable to that purpose upon the whole it seems that if we consider the use and end of sight together with the present state and circumstances of our being we shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or imperfection in it or easily conceive how it could be mended with such admirable wisdom is that faculty contrived both for the pleasure and convenience of life having finished what i intended to say concerning the distance and magnitude of objects i come now to treat of the manner wherein the mind perceives by sight their situation among the discoveries of the last age it is reputed none of the least that the manner of vision hath been more clearly explained than ever it had been before there is at this day no one ignorant that the pictures of external objects are painted on the retina or fund of the eye that we can see nothing which is not so painted and that according as the picture is more distinct or confused so also is the perception we have of the object but then in this explication of vision there occurs one mighty difficulty the objects are painted in an inverted order on the bottom of the eye the upper part of any object being painted on the lower part of the eye and the lower part of the object on the upper part of the eye and so also as to right and left since therefore the pictures are thus inverted it is demanded how it comes to pass that we see the objects erect and in their natural posture in answer to this difficulty we are told that the mind perceiving an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye considers this ray as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object and in like manner tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of the eye it is directed to the upper part of the object thus in the adjacent figure c the lower point of the object abc is projected on c the upper part of the eye so likewise the highest point a is projected on a the lowest part of the eye which makes the representation cba inverted but the mind considering the stroke that is made on c as coming in the straight line cc from the lower end of the object and the stroke or impulse on a as coming in the line aa from the upper end of the object is directed to make a right judgment of the situation of the object abc notwithstanding the picture of it is inverted this is illustrated by conceiving a blind man who holding in his hands two sticks that cross each other doth with them touch the extremities of an object placed in a perpendicular situation it is certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the object which he touches with the stick held in the undermost hand and that to be the lower part of the object which he touches with the stick in his uppermost hand this is the common explication of the erect appearance of objects which is generally received and acquiesced in being as mr molyneux tells us diopt par c p allowed by all men as satisfactory but this account to me does not seem in any degree true did i perceive those impulses decussations and directions of the rays of light in like manner as hath been set forth then indeed it would not be altogether void of probability and there might be some pretence for the comparison of the blind man and his cross sticks but the case is far otherwise i know very well that i perceive no such thing and of consequence i cannot thereby make an estimate of the situation of objects i appeal to anyones experience whether he be conscious to himself that he thinks on the intersection made by the radious sic pencils or pursues the impulses they give in right lines whenever he perceives by sight the position of any object to me it seems evident that crossing and tracing of the rays is never thought on by children idiots or in truth by any other save only those who have applied themselves to the study of optics and for the mind to judge of the situation of objects by those things without perceiving them or to perceive them without knowing it is equally beyond my comprehension add to this that the explaining the manner of vision by the example of cross sticks and hunting for the object along the axes of the radious pencils doth suppose the proper objects of sight to be perceived at a distance from us contrary to what hath been demonstrated it remains therefore that we look for some other explication of this difficulty and i believe it not impossible to find one provided we examine it to the bottom and carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch which cannot be too oft inculcated in treating of vision but more especially throughout the consideration of this affair we ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts for that from want of a right understanding thereof the difficulty of explaining erect vision seems chiefly to arise in order to disentangle our minds from whatever prejudices we may entertain with relation to the subject in hand nothing seems more apposite than the taking into our thoughts the case of one born blind and afterwards when grown up made to see and though perhaps it may not be an easy task to divest ourselves entirely of the experience received from sight so as to be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a ones we must nevertheless as far as possible endeavour to frame true conceptions of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in his mind it is certain that a man actually blind and who had continued so from his birth would by the sense of feeling attain to have ideas of upper and lower by the motion of his hand he might discern the situation of any tangible object placed within his fi reach that part on which he felt himself supported or towards which he perceived his body to gravitate he would term lower and the contrary to this upper and accordingly denominate whatsoever objects he touched but then whatever judgments he makes concerning the situation of objects are confined to those only that are perceivable by touch all those things that are intangible and of a spiritual nature his thoughts and desires his passions and in general all the modifications of the soul to these he would never apply the terms upper and lower except only in a metaphorical sense he may perhaps by way of allusion speak of high or low thoughts but those terms in their proper signification would never be applied to anything that was not conceived to exist without the mind for a man born blind and remaining in the same state could mean nothing else by the words higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body it is therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other would by him be thought higher or lower must be such as were conceived to exist without his mind in the ambient space whence it plainly follows that such a one if we suppose him made to see would not at first sight think anything he saw was high or low erect or inverted for it hath been already demonstrated in sect that he would not think the things he perceived by sight to be at any distance from him or without his mind the objects to which he had hitherto been used to apply the terms up and down high and low were such only as affected or were some way perceived by his couch but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch there is therefore nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms applicable to them nor would he ever think it till such time as he had observed their connexion with tangible objects and the same prejudice began to insinuate itself into his understanding which from their infancy had grown up in the understandings of other men to set this matter in a clearer light i shall make use of an example suppose the abovementioned blind person by his touch perceives a man to stand erect let us inquire into the manner of this by the application of his hand to the several parts of a human body he had perceived different tangible ideas which being collected into sundry complex ones have distinct names annexed to them thus one combination of a certain tangible figure bulk and consistency of parts is called the head another the hand a third the foot and so of the rest all which complex ideas could in his understanding be made up only of ideas perceivable by touch he had also by his touch obtained an idea of earth or ground towards which he perceives the parts of his body to have a natural tendency now by erect nothing more being meant than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet are nearest to the earth if the blind person by moving his hand over the parts of the man who stands before him perceives the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest from and those that compose the feet to be nearest to that other combination of tangible ideas which he calls earth he will denominate that man erect but if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his sight and that he behold a man standing before him it is evident in that case he would neither judge the man he sees to be erect nor inverted for he never having known those terms applied to any other save tangible things or which existed in the space without him and what he sees neither being tangible nor perceived as existing without he could not know that in propriety of language they were applicable to it afterwards when upon turning his head or eyes up and down to the right and left he shall observe the visible objects to change and shall also attain to know that they are called by the same names and connected with the objects perceived by touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation in the same terms that he has been used to apply to tangible things and those that he perceives by turning up his eyes he will call upper and those that by turning down his eyes he will call lower and this seems to me the true reason why he should think those objects uppermost that are painted on the lower part of his eye for by turning the eye up they shall be distinctly seen as likewise those that are painted on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly seen by turning the eye down and are for that reason esteemed lowest for we have shown that to the immediate objects of sight considered in themselves he would not attribute the terms high and low it must therefore be on account of some circumstances which are observed to attend them and these it is plain are the actions of turning the eye up and down which suggest a very obvious reason why the mind should denominate the objects of sight accordingly high or low and without this motion of the eye this turning it up and down in order to discern different objects doubtless erect inverse and other the like terms relating to the position of tangible objects would never have been transferred or in any degree apprehended to belong to the ideas of sight the mere act of seeing including nothing in it to that purpose whereas the different situations of the eye naturally direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of objects intromitted by it farther when he has by experience learned the connexion there is between the several ideas of sight and touch he will be able by the perception he has of the situation of visible things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward tangible things corresponding to them and thus it is he shall perceive by sight the situation of external objects which do not properly fall under that sense i know we are very prone to think that if just made to see we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now but we are also as prone to think that at first sight we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of objects as we do now which hath been shown to be a false and groundless persuasion and for the like reasons the same censure may be passed on the positive assurance that most men before they have thought sufficiently of the matter might have of their being able to determine by the eye at first view whether objects were erect or inverse it will perhaps be objected co our opinion that a man for instance being thought erect when his feet are next the earth and inverted when his head is next the earth it doth hence follow that by the mere act of vision without any experience or altering the situation of the eye we should have determined whether he were erect or inverted for both the earth itself and the limbs of the man who stands thereon being equally perceived by sight one cannot choose seeing what part of the man is nearest the earth and what part farthest from it ie whether he be erect or inverted to which i answer the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man are entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man nor was it possible by virtue of the visive faculty alone without superadding any experience of touch or altering the position of the eye ever to have known or so much as suspected there had been any relation or connexion between them hence a man at first view would not denominate anything he saw earth or head or foot and consequently he could not tell by the mere act of vision whether the head or feet were nearest the earth nor indeed would we have thereby any thought of earth or man erect or inverse at all which will be made yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular comparison between the ideas of both senses that which i see is only variety of light and colours that which i feel is hard or soft hot or cold rough or smooth what similitude what connexion have those ideas with these or how is it possible that anyone should see reason to give one and the same name to combinations of ideas so very different before he had experienced their coexistence we do not find there is any necessary connexion betwixt this or that tangible quality and any colour whatsoever and we may sometimes perceive colours where there is nothing to be felt all which doth make it manifest that no man at first receiving of his sight would know there was any agreement between this or that particular object of his sight and any object of touch he had been already acquainted with the colours therefore of the head would to him no more suggest the idea of head than they would the idea of foot farther we have at large shown vid sect and there is no discoverable necessary connexion between any given visible magnitude and any one particular tangible magnitude but that it is entirely the result of custom and experience and depends on foreign and accidental circumstances that we can by the perception of visible extension inform ourselves what may be the extension of any tangible object connected with it hence it is certain that neither the visible magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the mind at first opening of the eyes the respective tangible magnitudes of those parts by the foregoing section it is plain the visible figure of any part of the body hath no necessary connexion with the tangible figure thereof so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind for figure is the termination of magnitude whence it follows that no visible magnitude having in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible figure so as of itself and in a way prior to experience it might suggest it to the understanding this will be farther evident if we consider that what seems smooth and round to the touch may to sight if viewed through a microscope seem quite otherwise from all which laid together and duly considered we may clearly deduce this inference in the first act of vision no idea entering by the eye would have a perceivable connexion with the ideas to which the names earth man head foot etc were annexed in the understanding of a person blind from his birth so as in any sort to introduce them into his mind or make themselves be called by the same names and reputed the same things with them as afterwards they come to be there doth nevertheless remain one difficulty which perhaps may seem to press hard on our opinion and deserve not to be passed over for though it be granted that neither the colour size nor figure of the visible feet have any necessary connexion with the ideas that compose the tangible feet so as to bring them at first sight into my mind or make me in danger of confounding them before i had been used to and for some time experienced their connexion yet thus much seems undeniable namely that the number of the visible feet being the same with that of the tangible feet i may from hence without any experience of sight reasonably conclude that they represent or are connected with the feet rather than the head i say it seems the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head so that the blind man upon first reception of the visive faculty might know which were the feet or two and which the head or one in order to get clear of this seeming difficulty we need only observe that diversity of visible objects doth not necessarily infer diversity of tangible objects corresponding to them a picture painted with great variety of colours affects the touch in one uniform manner it is therefore evident that i do not by any necessary consecution independent of experience judge of the number of things tangible from the number of things visible i should not therefore at first opening my eyes conclude that because i see two i shall feel two how therefore can i before experience teaches me know that the visible legs because two are connected with the tangible legs or the visible head because one is connected with the tangible head the truth is the things i see are so very different and heterogeneous from the things i feel that the perception of the one would never have suggested the other to my thoughts or enabled me to pass the least judgment thereon until i had experienced their connexion but for a fuller illustration of this matter it ought to be considered that number however some may reckon it amongst the primary qualities is nothing fixed and settled really existing in things themselves it is entirely the creature of the mind considering either an idea by itself or any combination of ideas to which it gives one name and so makes it pass for an unit according as the mind variously combines its ideas the unit varies and as the unit so the number which is only a collection of units doth also vary we call a window one a chimney one and yet a house in which there are many windows and many chimneys hath an equal right to be called one and many houses go to the making of the city in these and the like instances it is evident the unit constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of its ideas to which it affixes names and wherein it includes more or less as best suits its own ends and purposes whatever therefore the mind considers as one that is an unit every combination of ideas is considered as one thing by the mind and in token thereof is marked by one name now this naming and combining together of ideas is perfectly arbitrary and done by the mind in such sort as experience shows it to be most convenient without which our ideas had never been collected into such sundry distinct combinations as they now are hence it follows that a man born blind and afterwards when grown up made to see would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up together under one name he would not for example make into one complex idea and thereby esteem an unit all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot for there can be no reason assigned why he should do so barely upon his seeing a man stand upright before him there crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man in company with all the other ideas of sight perceived at the same time but all these ideas offered at once to his view he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such time as by observing the motion of the parts of the man and other experiences he comes to know which are to be separated and which to be collected together from what hath been premised it is plain the objects of sight and touch make if i may so say two sets of ideas which are widely different from each other to objects of either kind we indifferently attribute the terms high and low right and left and suchlike denoting the position or situation of things but then we must well observe that the position of any object is determined with respect only to objects of the same sense we say any object of touch is high or low according as it is more or less distant from the tangible earth and in like manner we denominate any object of sight high or low in proportion as it is more or less distant from the visible earth but to define the situation of visible things with relation to the distance they bear from any tangible thing or vice versa this were absurd and perfectly unintelligible for all visible things are equally in the mind and take up no part of the external space and consequently are equidistant from any tangible thing which exists without the mind or rather to speak truly the proper objects of sight are at no distance neither near nor far from any tangible thing for if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find that those things only are compared together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same sense for by the distance between any two points nothing more is meant than the number of intermediate points if the given points are visible the distance between them is marked out by the number of the interjacent visible points if they are tangible the distance between them is a line consisting of tangible points but if they are one tangible and the other visible the distance between them doth neither consist of points perceivable by sight nor by touch ie it is utterly inconceivable this perhaps will not find an easy admission into all mens understanding however i should gladly be informed whether it be not true by anyone who will be at the pains to reflect a little and apply it home to his thoughts the not observing what has been delivered in the two last sections seems to have occasioned no small part of the difficulty that occurs in the business of erect appearances the head which is painted nearest the earth seems to be farthest from it and on the other hand the feet which are painted farthest from the earth are thought nearest to it herein lies the difficulty which vanishes if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity thus how comes it that to the eye the visible head which is nearest the tangible earth seems farthest from the earth and the visible feet which are farthest from the tangible earth seem nearest the earth the question being thus proposed who sees not the difficulty is founded on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty or rather the soul by means thereof should judge of the situation of visible objects with reference to their distance from the tangible earth whereas it is evident the tangible earth is not perceived by sight and it hath been shown in the two last preceding sections that the location of visible objects is determined only by the distance they bear from one another and that it is nonsense to talk of distance far or near between a visible and tangible thing if we confine our thoughts to the proper objects of sight the whole is plain and easy the head is painted farthest from and the feet nearest to the visible earth and so they appear to be what is there strange or unaccountable in this let us suppose the pictures in the fund of the eye to be the immediate objects of the sight the consequence is that things should appear in the same posture they are painted in and is it not so the head which is seen seems farthest from the earth which is seen and the feet which are seen seem nearest to the earth which is seen and just so they are painted but say you the picture of the man is inverted and yet the appearance is erect i ask what mean you by the picture of the man or which is the same thing the visible mans being inverted you tell me it is inverted because the heels are uppermost and the head undermost explain me this you say that by the heads being undermost you mean that it is nearest to the earth and by the heels being uppermost that they are farthest from the earth i ask again what earth you mean you cannot mean the earth that is painted on the eye or the visible earth for the picture of the head is farthest from the picture of the earth and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth and accordingly the visible head is farthest from the visible earth and the visible feet nearest to it it remains therefore that you mean the tangible earth and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things contrary to what hath been demonstrated in sect and the two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be considered apart and as if their objects had no intercourse no manner of relation one to another in point of distance or position farther what greatly contributes to make us mistake in this matter is that when we think of the pictures in the fund of the eye we imagine ourselves looking on the fund of anothers eye or another looking on the fund of our own eye and beholding the pictures painted thereon suppose two eyes a and b a from some distance looking on the pictures in b sees them inverted and for that reason concludes they are inverted in b but this is wrong there are projected in little on the bottom of a the images of the pictures of suppose man earth etc which are painted on b and besides these the eye b itself and the objects which environ it together with another earth are projected in a larger size on a now by the eye a these larger images are deemed the true objects and the lesser only pictures in miniature and it is with respect to those greater images that it determines the situation of the smaller images so that comparing the little man with the great earth a judges him inverted or that the feet are farthest from and the head nearest to the great earth whereas if a compare the little man with the little earth then he will appear erect ie his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest to the little earth but we must consider that b does not see two earths as a does it sees only what is represented by the little pictures in a and consequently shall judge the man erect for in truth the man in b is not inverted for there the feet are next the earth but it is the representation of it in a which is inverted for there the head of the representation of the picture of the man in b is next the earth and the feet farthest from the earth meaning the earth which is without the representation of the pictures in b for if you take the little images of the pictures in b and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they are all erect and in their natural posture farther there lies a mistake in our imagining that the pictures of external objects are painted on the bottom of the eye it hath been shown there is no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things tangible it hath likewise been demonstrated that the proper objects of sight do not exist without the mind whence it clearly follows that the pictures painted on the bottom of the eye are not the pictures of external objects let anyone consult his own thoughts and then say what affinity what likeness there is between that certain variety and disposition of colours which constitute the visible man or picture of a man and that other combination of far different ideas sensible by touch which compose the tangible man but if this be the case how come they to be accounted pictures or images since that supposes them to copy or represent some originals or other to which i answer in the forementioned instance the eye a takes the little images included within the representation of the other eye b to be pictures or copies whereof the archetypes are not things existing without but the larger pictures projected on its own fund and which by a are not thought pictures but the originals or true things themselves though if we suppose a third eye c from a due distance to behold the fund of a then indeed the things projected thereon shall to c seem pictures or images in the same sense that those projected on b do to a rightly to conceive this point we must carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch between the visible and tangible eye for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either is or seems to be painted again the visible eye as well as all other visible objects hath been shown to exist only in the mind which perceiving its own ideas and comparing them together calls some pictures in respect of others what hath been said being rightly comprehended and laid together doth i think afford a full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of objects which phenomenon i must confess i do not see how it can be explained by any theories of vision hitherto made public in treating of these things the use of language is apt to occasion some obscurity and confusion and create in us wrong ideas for language being accommodated to the common notions and prejudices of men it is scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth without great circumlocution impropriety and to an unwary reader seeming contradictions i do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what i have written concerning vision that he would not stick in this or that phrase or manner of expression but candidly collect my meaning from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse and laying aside the words as much as possible consider the bare notions themselves and then judge whether they are agreeable to truth and his own experience or no we have shown the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas doth perceive or apprehend the distance magnitude and situation of tangible objects we come now to inquire more particularly concerning the difference between the ideas of sight and touch which are called by the same names and see whether there be any idea common to both senses from what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this treatise it is plain there is no one selfsame numerical extension perceived both by sight and touch but that the particular figures and extensions perceived by sight however they may be called by the same names and reputed the same things with those perceived by touch are nevertheless different and have an existence distinct and separate from them so that the question is not now concerning the same numerical ideas but whether there be any one and the same sort of species of ideas equally perceivable to both senses or in other words whether extension figure and motion perceived by sight are not specifically distinct from extension figure and motion perceived by touch but before i come more particularly to discuss this matter i find it proper to consider extension in abstract for of this there is much talk and i am apt to think that when men speak of extension as being an idea common to two senses it is with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all other tangible and visible qualities and form thereof an abstract idea which idea they will have common both to sight and touch we are therefore to understand by extension in abstract an idea of extension for instance a line or surface entirely stripped of all other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it to any particular existence it is neither black nor white nor red nor hath it any colour at all or any tangible quality whatsoever and consequently it is of no finite determinate magnitude for that which bounds or distinguishes one extension from another is some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree now i do not find that i can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my mind such an abstract idea as is here spoken of a line or surface which is neither black nor white nor blue nor yellow etc nor long nor short nor rough nor smooth nor square nor round etc is perfectly incomprehensible this i am sure of as to myself how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can tell it is commonly said that the object of geometry is abstract extension but geometry contemplates figures now figure is the termination of magnitude but we have shown that extension in abstract hath no finite determinate magnitude whence it clearly follows that it can have no figure and consequently is not the object of geometry it is indeed a tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient philosophers that all general truths are concerning universal abstract ideas without which we are told there could be no science no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry but it were no hard matter did i think it necessary to my present purpose to show that propositions and demonstrations in geometry might be universal though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circles after reiterated endeavours to apprehend the general idea a triangle i have found it altogether incomprehensible and surely if anyone were able to introduce that idea into my mind it must be the author of the essay concerning human understanding he who has so far distinguished himself from the generality of writers by the clearness and significancy of what he says let us therefore see how this celebrated author describes the general or abstract idea of a triangle it must be says he neither oblique nor rectangular neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenum but all and none of these at once in effect it is somewhat imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together essay on hum understand b iv c s this is the idea which he thinks needful for the enlargement of knowledge which is the subject of mathematical demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concerning triangles that author acknowledges it doth require some pains and skill to form this general idea of a triangle ibid but had he called to mind what he says in another place to wit that ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the mind ie be conceived vid b iii c s ibid i say had this occurred to his thoughts it is not improbable he would have owned it above all the pains and skill he was master of to form the abovementioned idea of a triangle which is made up of manifest staring contradictions that a man who laid so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising but the wonder will lessen if it be considered that the source whence this opinion flows is the prolific womb which has brought forth innumerable errors and difficulties in all parts of philosophy and in all the sciences but this matter taken in its full extent were a subject too comprehensive to be insisted on in this place and so much for extension in abstract some perhaps may think pure space vacuum or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight yet if i mistake not in the foregoing parts of this essay that hath been clearly demonstrated to be a mere delusion arising from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy which so closely connects the idea of distance with those of sight that we are apt to think it is itself a proper and immediate object of that sense till reason corrects the mistake it having been shown that there are no abstract ideas of figure and that it is impossible for us by any precision of thought to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch the question now remaining is whether the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by touch in answer to which i shall venture to lay down the following proposition the extension figures and motions perceived by sight are specifically distinct from the ideas of touch called by the same names nor is there any such thing as one idea or kind of idea common to both senses this proposition may without much difficulty be collected from what hath been said in several places of this essay but because it seems so remote from and contrary to the received notions and settled opinion of mankind i shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the following arguments when upon perception of an idea i range it under this or that sort it is because it is perceived after the same manner or because it has a likeness or conformity with or affects me in the same way as the ideas of the sort i rank it under in short it must not be entirely new but have something in it old and already perceived by me it must i say have so much at least in common with the ideas i have before known and named as to make me give it the same name with them but it has been if i mistake not clearly made out that a man born blind would not at first reception of his sight think the things he saw were of the same nature with the objects of touch or had anything in common with them but that they were a new set of ideas perceived in a new manner and entirely different from all he had ever perceived before so that he would not call them by the same name nor repute them to be of the same sort with anything he had hitherto known secondly light and colours are allowed by all to constitute a son or species entirely different from the ideas of touch nor will any man i presume say they can make themselves perceived by that sense but there is no other immediate object of sight besides light and colours it is therefore a direct consequence that there is no idea common to both senses it is a prevailing opinion even amongst those who have thought and writ most accurately concerning our ideas and the ways whereby they enter into the understanding that something more is perceived by sight than barely light and colours with their variations mr locke termeth sight the most comprehensive of all our senses conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours which are peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion essay on human understand b ii c s space or distance we have shown is not otherwise the object of sight than of hearing vid sect and as for figure and extension i leave it to anyone that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he had any idea intromitted immediately and properly by sight save only light and colours or whether it de possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all colour and on the other hand whether he can conceive colour without visible extension for my own part i must confess i am not able to attain so great a nicety of abstraction in a strict sense i see nothing but light and colours with their several shades and variations he who beside these doth also perceive by sight ideas far different and distinct from them hath that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than i can pretend to it must be owned that by the mediation of light and colours other far different ideas are suggested to my mind but so they are by hearing which beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense doth by their mediation suggest not only space figure and motion but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words thirdly it is i think an axiom universally received that quantities of the same kind may be added together and make one entire sum mathematicians add lines together but they do not add a line to a solid or conceive it as making one sum with a surface these three kinds of quantity being thought incapable of any such mutual addition and consequently of being compared together in the several ways of proportion are by then esteemed entirely disparate and heterogeneous now let anyone try in his thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or surface so as to conceive them making one continued sum or whole he that can do this may think them homogeneous but he that cannot must by the foregoing axiom think them heterogeneous a blue and a red line i can conceive added together into one sum and making one continued line but to make in my thoughts one continued line of a visible and tangible line added together is i find a task far more difficult and even insurmountable and i leave it to the reflexion and experience of every particular person to determine for himself a farther confirmation of our tenet may be drawn from the solution of mr molyneuxs problem published by mr locke in his essay which i shall set down as it there lies together with mr lockes opinion of it suppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly sic of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and tother which is the cube and which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be made to see quaere whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answers not for though he has obtained the experience of how a globe how a cube affects his touch yet he has not yet attained the experience that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that pressed his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it doth in the cube i agree with this thinking gentleman whom i am proud to call my friend in his answer to this his problem and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them essay on human understanding b ii c s now if a square surface perceived by touch be of the same sort with a square surface perceived by sight it is certain the blind man here mentioned might know a square surface as soon as he saw it it is no more but introducing into his mind by a new inlet an idea he has been already well acquainted with since therefore he is supposed to have known by his touch that a cube is a body terminated by square surfaces and that a sphere is not terminated by square surfaces upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only in numero it follows that he might know by the unerring mark of the square surfaces which was the cube and which not while he only saw them we must therefore allow either that visible extension and figures are specifically distinct from tangible extension and figures or else that the solution of this problem given by those two thoughtful and ingenious men is wrong much more might be laid together in proof of the proposition i have advanced but what has been said is if i mistake not sufficient to convince anyone that shall yield a reasonable attention and as for those that will not be at the pains of a little thought no multiplication of words will ever suffice to make them understand the truth or rightly conceive my meaning i cannot let go the abovementioned problem without some reflexion on it it hath been evident that a man blind from his birth would not at first sight denominate anything he saw by the names he had been used to appropriate to ideas of touch vid sect cube sphere table are words he has known applied to things perceivable by touch but to things perfectly intangible he never knew them applied those words in their wonted application always marked out to his mind bodies or solid things which were perceived by the resistance they gave but there is no solidity no resistance or protrusion perceived by sight in short the ideas of sight are all new perceptions to which there be no names annexed in his mind he cannot therefore understand what is said to him concerning them and to ask of the two bodies he saw placed on the table which was the sphere which the cube were to him a question downright bantering and unintelligible nothing he sees being able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body distance or in general of anything he had already known it is a mistake to think the same thing affects both sight and touch if the same angle or square which is the object of touch be also the object of vision what should hinder the blind man at first sight from knowing it for though the manner wherein it affects the sight be different from that wherein it affected his touch yet there being beside his manner or circumstance which is new and unknown the angle or figure which is old and known he cannot choose but discern it visible figure and extension having been demonstrated to be of a nature entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and extension it remains that we inquire concerning now that visible motion is not of the same sort with tangible motion seems to need no farther proof it being an evident corollary from what we have shown concerning the difference there is between visible and tangible extension but for a more full and express proof hereof we need only observe that one who had not yet experienced vision would not at first sight know motion whence it clearly follows that motion perceivable by sight is of a sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch the antecedent i prove thus by touch he could not perceive any motion but what was up or down to the right or left nearer or farther from him besides these and their several varieties or complications it is impossible he should have any idea of motion he would not therefore think anything to be motion or give the name motion to any idea which he could not range under some or other of those particular kinds thereof but from sect it is plain that by the mere act of vision he could not know motion upwards or downwards to the right or left or in any other possible direction from which i conclude he would not know motion at all at first sight as for the idea of motion in abstract i shall not waste paper about it but leave it to my reader to make the best he can of it to me it is perfectly unintelligible the consideration of motion may furnish a new field for inquiry but since the manner wherein the mind apprehends by sight the motion of tangible objects with the various degrees thereof may be easily collected from what hath been said concerning the manner wherein that sense doth suggest their various distances magnitudes and situations i shall not enlarge any farther on this subject but proceed to consider what may be alleged with greatest appearance of reason against the proposition we have shown to be true for where there is so much prejudice to be encountered a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice we must also satisfy the scruples that men may raise in favour of their preconceived notions show whence the mistake arises how it came to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the mind first therefore it will be demanded how visible extension and figures come to be called by the same name with tangible extension and figures if they are not of the same kind with them it must be something more than humour or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this which has obtained in all ages and nations of the world and amongst all ranks of men the learned as well as the illiterate to which i answer we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their being called by the same name than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consisting of six letters whereby it is marked are of the same species because they are both called by the same name it is customary to call written words and the things they signify by the same name for words not being regarded in their own nature or otherwise than as they are marks of things it had been superfluous and beside the design of language to have given them names distinct from those of the things marked by them the same reason holds here also visible figures are the marks of tangible figures and from sect it is plain that in themselves they are little regarded or upon any other score than for their connexion with tangible figures which by nature they are ordained to signify and because this language of nature doth not vary in different ages or nations hence it is that in all times and places visible figures are called by the same names as the respective tangible figures suggested by them and not because they are alike or of the same sort with them but say you surely a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle it has four angles and as many sides so also has the visible square but the visible circle has no such thing being bounded by one uniform curve without right lines or angles which makes it unfit to represent the tangible square but very fit to represent the tangible circle whence it clearly follows that visible figures are patterns of or of the same species with the respective tangible figures represented by them that they are like unto them and of their own nature fitted to represent them as being of the same sort and that they are in no respect arbitrary signs as words i answer it must be acknowledged the visible square is fitter than the visible circle to represent the tangible square but then it is not because it is liker or more of a species with it but because the visible square contains in it several distinct parts whereby to mark the several distinct corresponding parts of a tangible square whereas the visible circle doth not the square perceived by touch hath four distinct equal sides so also hath it four distinct equal angles it is therefore necessary that the visible figure which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal parts corresponding to the four sides of the tangible square as likewise four other distinct and equal parts whereby to denote the four equal angles of the tangible square and accordingly we see the visible figures contain in them distinct visible parts answering to the distinct tangible parts of the figures signified or suggested by them but it will not hence follow that any visible figure is like unto or of the same species with its corresponding tangible figure unless it be also shown that not only the number but also the kind of the parts be the same in both to illustrate this i observe that visible figures represent tangible figures much after the same manner that written words do sounds now in this respect words are not arbitrary it not being indifferent what written word stands for any sound but it is requisite that each word contain in it so many distinct characters as there are variations in the sound it stands for thus the single letter a is proper to mark one simple uniform sound and the word adultery is accommodated to represent the sound annexed to it in the formation whereof there being eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the organs of speech each of which produces a difference of sound it was fit the word representing it should consist of as many distinct characters thereby to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound and yet nobody i presume will say the single letter a or the word adultery are like unto or of the same species with the respective sounds by them represented it is indeed arbitrary that in general letters of any language represent sounds at all but when that is once agreed it is not arbitrary what combination of letters shall represent this or that particular sound i leave this with the reader to pursue and apply it in his own thoughts it must be confessed that we are not so apt to confound other signs with the things signified or to think them of the same species as we are visible and tangible ideas but a little consideration will show us how this may be without our supposing them of a like nature these signs are constant and universal their connexion with tangible ideas has been learnt at our first entrance into the world and ever since almost every moment of our lives it has been occurring to our thoughts and fastening and striking deeper on our minds when we observe that signs are variable and of human institution when we remember there was a time they were not connected in our minds with those things they now so readily suggest but that their signification was learned by the slow steps of experience this preserves us from confounding them but when we find the same signs suggest the same things all over the world when we know they are not of human institution and cannot remember that we ever learned their signification but think that at first sight they would have suggested to us the same things they do now all this persuades us they are of the same species as the things respectively represented by them and that it is by a natural resemblance they suggest them to our minds add to this that whenever we make a nice survey of any object successively directing the optic axis to each point thereof there are certain lines and figures described by the motion of the head or eye which being in truth perceived by feeling do nevertheless so mix themselves as it were with the ideas of sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense again the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than is usual in the other senses beside the touch sounds for example perceived at the same instant are apt to coalesce if i may so say into one sound but we can perceive at the same time great variety of visible objects very separate and distinct from each other now tangible extension being made up of several distinct coexistent parts we may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a likeness or an analogy between the immediate objects of sight and touch but nothing certainly doth more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close connexion they have with each other we cannot open our eyes but the ideas of distance bodies and tangible figures are suggested by them so swift and sudden and unperceived is the transition from visible to tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear thinking them equally the immediate object of vision the prejudice which is grounded on these and whatever other causes may be assigned thereof sticks so fast that it is impossible without obstinate striving and labour of the mind to get entirely clear of it but then the reluctancy we find in rejecting any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever considers what has been already shown with regard to the prejudices we entertain concerning the distance magnitude and situation of objects prejudices so familiar to our minds so confirmed and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest demonstration upon the whole i think we may fairly conclude that the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the author of nature whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and wellbeing of our bodies as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them it is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life and the manner wherein they signify and mark unto us the objects which are at a distance is the same with that of languages and signs of human appointment which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or identity of nature but only by an habitual connexion that experience has made us to observe between them suppose one who had always continued blind be told by his guide that after he has advanced so many steps he shall come to the brink of a precipice or be stopped by a wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprizing he cannot conceive how it is possible for mortals to frame such predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as prophesy doth to others even they who are blessed with the visive faculty may though familiarity make it less observed find therein sufficient cause of admiration the wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it is adjusted to those ends and purposes for which it was apparently designed the vast extent number and variety of objects that are at once with so much ease and quickness and pleasure suggested by it all these afford subject for much and pleasing speculation and may if anything give us some glimmering analogous prenotion of things which are placed beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of our present state i do not design to trouble myself with drawing corollaries from the doctrine i have hitherto laid down if it bears the test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their thoughts in extending it farther and applying it to whatever purposes it may be subservient to only i cannot forbear making some inquiry concerning the object of geometry which the subject we have been upon doth naturally lead one to we have shown there is no such idea as that of extension in abstract and that there are two kinds of sensible extension and figures which are entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other now it is natural to inquire which of these is the object of geometry some things there are which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension the constant use of the eyes both in the practical and speculative parts of that science doth very much induce us thereto it would without doubt seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagrams he saw upon paper were not the figures or even the likeness of the figures which make the subject of the demonstration the contrary being held an unquestionable truth not only by mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic i mean who consider the nature of science certainty and demonstration it being by them assigned as one reason of the extraordinary clearness and evidence of geometry that in this science the reasonings are free from those inconveniences which attend the use of arbitrary signs the very ideas themselves being copied out and exposed to view upon paper but by the bye how well this agrees with what they likewise assert of abstract ideas being the object of geometrical demonstration i leave to be considered to come to a resolution in this point we need only observe what hath been said in sect where it is shown that visible extensions in themselves are little regarded and have no settled determinable greatness and that men measure altogether by the application of tangible extension to tangible extension all which makes it evident that visible extension and figures are not the object of geometry it is therefore plain that visible figure are of the same use in geometry that words are and the one may as well be accounted the object of that science as the other neither of them being otherwise concerned therein than as they represent or suggest to the mind the particular tangible figures connected with them there is indeed this difference between the signification of tangible figures by visible figures and of ideas by words that whereas the latter is variable and uncertain depending altogether on the arbitrary appointment of men the former is fixed and immutably the same in all times and places a visible square for instance suggests to the mind the same tangible figure in europe that it doth in america hence it is that the voice of the author of nature which speaks to our eyes is not liable to that misinterpretation and ambiguity that languages of human contrivance are unavoidably subject to though what has been said may suffice to show what ought to be determined with relation to the object of geometry i shall nevertheless for the fuller illustration thereof consider the case of an intelligence or unbodied spirit which is supposed to see perfectly well ie to have a clear perception of the proper and immediate objects of sight but to have no sense of touch whether there be any such being in nature or no is beside my purpose to inquire it sufficeth that the supposition contains no contradiction in it let us now examine what proficiency such a one may be able to make in geometry which speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the object of that science first then it is certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea of a solid or quantity of three dimensions which followeth from its not having any idea of distance we indeed are prone to think that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids which ariseth from our imagining that we do strictly speaking see distance and some parts of an object at a greater distance than others which hath been demonstrated to be the effect of the experience we have had what ideas of touch are connected with such and such ideas attending vision but the intelligence here spoken of is supposed to have no experience of touch he would not therefore judge as we do nor have any idea of distance outness or profundity nor consequently of space or body either immediately or by suggestion whence it is plain he can have no notion of those parts of geometry which relate to the mensuration of solids and their convex or concave surfaces and contemplate the properties of lines generated by the section of a solid the conceiving of any part whereof is beyond the reach of his faculties farther he cannot comprehend the manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle the rule and compass with their use being things of which it is impossible he should have any notion nor is it an easier matter for him to conceive the placing of one plane or angle on another in order to prove their equality since that supposeth some idea of distance or external space all which makes it evident our pure intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first elements of plane geometry and perhaps upon a nice inquiry it will be found he cannot even have an idea of plane figures any more than he can of solids since some idea of distance is necessary to form the idea of a geometrical plane as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it all that is properly perceived by the visive faculty amounts to no more than colours with their variations and different proportions of light and shade but the perpetual mutability and fleetingness of those immediate objects of sight render them incapable of being managed after the manner of geometrical figures nor is it in any degree useful that they should it is true there are divers of them perceived at once and more of some and less of others but accurately to compute their magnitude and assign precise determinate proportions between things so variable and inconstant if we suppose it possible to be done must yet be a very trifling and insignificant labour i must confess men are tempted to think that flat or plane figures are immediate objects of sight though they acknowledge solids are not and this opinion is grounded on what is observed in painting wherein it seems the ideas immediately imprinted on the mind are only of planes variously coloured which by a sudden act of the judgment are changed into solids but with a little attention we shall find the planes here mentioned as the immediate objects of sight are not visible but tangible planes for when we say that pictures are planes we mean thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform but then this smoothness and uniformity or in other words this planeness of the picture is not perceived immediately by vision for it appeareth to the eye various and multiform from all which we may conclude that planes are no more the immediate object of sight than solids what we strictly see are not solids nor yet planes variously coloured they are only diversity of colours and some of these suggest to the mind solids and other plane figures just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other so that we see planes in the same way that we see solids both being equally suggested by the immediate objects of sight which accordingly are themselves denominated planes and solids but though they are called by the same names with the things marked by them they are nevertheless of a nature entirely different as hath been demonstrated what hath been said is if i mistake not sufficient to decide the question we proposed to examine concerning the ability of a pure spirit such as we have described to know geometry it is indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an intelligence because we cannot without great pains cleverly separate and disentangle in our thoughts the proper objects of sight from those of touch which are connected with them this indeed in a complete degree seems scarce possible to be performed which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it is for anyone to hear the words of his native language pronounced in his ears without understanding them though he endeavour to disunite the meaning from the sound it will nevertheless intrude into his thoughts and he shall find it extreme difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the posture of a foreigner that never learned the language so as to be affected barely with the sounds themselves and not perceive the signification annexed to them by this time i suppose it is clear that neither abstract nor visible extension makes the object of geometry the not discerning of which may perhaps have created some difficulty and useless labour in mathematics sure i am that somewhat relating thereto has occurred to my thoughts which though after the most anxious and repeated examination i am forced to think it true doth nevertheless seem so far out of the common road of geometry that i know not whether it may not be thought presumption if i should make it public in an age wherein that science hath received such mighty improvements by new methods great part whereof as well as of the ancient discoveries may perhaps lose their reputation and much of that ardour with which men study the abstruse and fine geometry be abated if what to me and those few to whom i have imparted it seems evidently true should really prove to be sothree dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to sceptics and atheists george berkeley contents the first dialogue the second dialogue the third dialogue the first dialogue philonous good morning hylas i didnt expect to find you out and about so early hylas it is indeed somewhat unusual but my thoughts were so taken up with a subject i was talking about last night that i couldnt sleep so i decided to get up and walk in the garden thats good it gives you a chance to see what innocent and agreeable pleasures you lose every morning can there be a pleasanter time of the day or a more delightful season of the year that purple sky those wild but sweet notes of birds the fragrant bloom on the trees and flowers the gentle influence of the rising sun these and a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret raptures but im afraid i am interrupting your thoughts for you seemed very intent on something yes i was and id be grateful if you would allow me to carry on with it but i dont in the least want to deprive myself of your company for my thoughts always flow more easily in conversation with a friend than when i am alone please may i share with you the thoughts i have been having with all my heart it is what i would have requested myself if you hadnt asked first i was considering the odd fate of those men who have in all ages through a desire to mark themselves off from the common people or through heaven knows what trick of their thought claimed either to believe nothing at all or to believe the most extravagant things in the world this wouldnt matter so much if their paradoxes and scepticism didnt bring consequences that are bad for mankind in general but theres a risk that they will do that and that when men who are thought to have spent their whole time in the pursuit of knowledge claim to be entirely ignorant of everything or advocate views that are in conflict with plain and commonly accepted principles this will tempt other peoplewho have less leisure for this sort of thingto become suspicious of the most important truths ones they had previously thought to be sacred and unquestionable i entirely agree with you about the bad effects of the paraded doubts of some philosophers and the fantastical views of others i have felt this so strongly in recent times that i have dropped some of the highflown theories i had learned in their universities replacing them with ordinary common opinions since this revolt of mine against metaphysical notions and in favour of the plain dictates of nature and common sense i swear that i find i can think ever so much better so that i can now easily understand many things which previously were mysteries and riddles i am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts i heard of you what if you please were they in last nights conversation you were represented as someone who maintains the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind of man namely that there is no such thing as material substance in the world i seriously believe that there is no such thing as what philosophers call material substance but if i were made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this then i would have the same reason to renounce this belief as i think i have now to reject the contrary opinion what can anything be more fantastical more in conflict with common sense or a more obvious piece of scepticism than to believe there is no such thing as matter steady on hylas what if it were to turn out that you who hold that there is matter areby virtue of that opiniona greater sceptic and maintain more paradoxes and conflicts with common sense than i who believe no such thing you have as good a chance of convincing me that the part is greater than the whole as of convincing me that i must give up my belief in matter if i am to avoid absurdity and scepticism well then are you content to accept as true any opinion that turns out to be the most agreeable to common sense and most remote from scepticism with all my heart since you want to start arguments about the plainest things in the world i am content for once to hear what you have to say tell me please hylas what do you mean by a sceptic i mean what everyone means someone who doubts everything so if someone has no doubts concerning some particular point then with regard to that point he cannot be thought a sceptic i agree with you does doubting consist in accepting the affirmative or the negative side of a question neither anyone who understands english must know that doubting signifies a suspense between the two sides so if someone denies any point he can no more be said to doubt concerning it than he who affirms it with the same degree of assurance true and so his denial no more makes him a sceptic than the other is i acknowledge it then how does it happen hylas that you call me a sceptic because i deny what you affirm namely the existence of matter for all you know i may be as firmly convinced in my denial as you are in your affirmation hold on a moment philonous my definition of sceptic was wrong but you cant hold a man to every false step he makes in conversation i did say that a sceptic is someone who doubts everything but i should have added or who denies the reality and truth of things what things do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences but these you know are universal intellectual notions and have nothing to do with matter so that the denial of matter doesnt imply the denial of them i agree about that but what about other things what do you think about distrusting the senses denying the real existence of sensible things or claiming to know nothing of them isnt that enough to qualify a man as a sceptic throughout the dialogues sensible means capable of being sensedthat is visible or audible or tangible etc well then let us see which of us it is that denies the reality of sensible things or claims to have the greatest ignorance of them since if i understand you rightly he is to be counted the greater sceptic that is what i desire what do you mean by sensible things things that are perceived by the senses can you imagine that i mean anything else im sorry but it may greatly shorten our enquiry if i have a clear grasp of your notions bear with me then while i ask you this further question are things perceived by the senses only the ones that are perceived immediately or do they include things that are perceived mediately that is through the intervention of something else i dont properly understand you in reading a book what i immediately perceive are the letters on the page but mediately or by means of these the notions of god virtue truth etc are suggested to my mind now theres no doubt that the letters are truly sensible things or things perceived by sense but i want to know whether you take the things suggested by them to be perceived by sense too no certainly it would be absurd to think that god or virtue are sensible things though they may be signified and suggested to the mind by sensible marks with which they have an arbitrary connection it seems then that by sensible things you mean only those that can be perceived immediately by sense right doesnt it follow from this that when i see one part of the sky red and another blue and i infer from this that there must be some cause for that difference of colours that cause cannot be said to be a sensible thing or perceived by eyesight it does similarly when i hear a variety of sounds i cannot be said to hear their causes you cannot and when by touch i feel a thing to be hot and heavy i cant say with any truth or correctness that i feel the cause of its heat or weight to head off any more questions of this kind i tell you once and for all that by sensible things i mean only things that are perceived by sense and that the senses perceive only what they perceive immediately because they dont make inferences so the deducing of causes or occasions from effects and appearances which are the only things we perceive by sense is entirely the business of reason in this context occasion can be taken as equivalent to cause the two terms are separated in the second dialogue at page we agree then that sensible things include only things that are immediately perceived by sense now tell me whether we immediately perceive by sight anything besides light colours and shapes by hearing anything but sounds by the palate anything besides tastes by the sense of smell anything besides odours by touch anything more than tangible qualities we do not so it seems that if you take away all sensible qualities there is nothing left that is sensible i agree sensible things then are nothing but so many sensible qualities or combinations of sensible qualities nothing else so heat is a sensible thing certainly does the reality of sensible things consist in being perceived or is it something different from their being perceivedsomething that doesnt involve the mind to exist is one thing and to be perceived is another i am talking only about sensible things my question is by the real existence of one of them do you mean an existence exterior to the mind and distinct from their being perceived i mean a real absolute existencedistinct from and having no relation to their being perceived so if heat is granted to have a real existence it must exist outside the mind it must tell me hylas is this real existence equally possible for all degrees of heat that we feel or is there a reason why we should attribute it to some degrees of heat and not to others if there is please tell me what it is whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense we can be sure exists also in the object that occasions it what the greatest as well as the least yes because the same reason holds for both they are both perceived by sense indeed the greater degree of heat is more intensely sensibly perceived so if there is any difference it is that we are more certain of the real existence of a greater heat than we can be of the reality of a lesser but isnt the most fierce and intense degree of heat a very great pain noone can deny that and can any unperceiving thing have pain or pleasure certainly not is your material substance a senseless thing or does it have sense and perception it is senseless without doubt so it cant be the subject of pain indeed it cant nor consequently can it be the subject of the greatest heat perceived by sense since you agree that this is a considerable pain i accept that then what are we to say about your external object is it a material substance or is it not it is a material substance with the sensible qualities inhering in it but then how can a great heat exist in it since you agree it cannot exist in a material substance please clear up this point hold on philonous im afraid i went wrong in granting that intense heat is a pain i should have said not that the pain is the heat but that it is the consequence or effect of the heat when you put your hand near the fire do you feel one simple uniform sensation or two distinct sensations just one simple sensation isnt the heat immediately perceived it is and the pain true well then seeing that they are both immediately perceived at the same time and that the fire affects you with only one simple or uncompounded idea one idea without parts it follows that this one simple idea is both the immediately perceived intense heat and the pain and consequently that the immediately perceived intense heat is identical with a particular sort of pain it seems so consult your thoughts again hylas can you conceive an intense sensation to occur without pain or pleasure i cannot or can you form an idea of sensible pain or pleasure in general abstracted from every particular idea of heat cold tastes smells etc i dont find that i can then doesnt it follow that sensible pain is nothing but intense degrees of those sensations or ideas that is undeniable in fact im starting to suspect that a very great heat cant exist except in a mind perceiving it what are you then in that sceptical state of suspense between affirming and denying i think i can be definite about it a very violent and painful heat cant exist outside the mind so according to you it has no real existence i admit it is it certain then that no body in nature is really hot i havent said that there is no real heat in bodies i only say that theres no such thing as an intense real heat in bodies but didnt you say earlier that all degrees of heat are equally real or that if there is any difference the greater heat is more certainly real than the lesser yes i did but that was because i had overlooked the reason there is for distinguishing between them which i now plainly see it is this because intense heat is nothing but a particular kind of painful sensation and pain cant exist except in a perceiving being it follows that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal bodily substance but thats no reason for denying that less intense heat can exist in such a substance but how are we to draw the line separating degrees of heat that exist only in the mind from ones that exist outside it that isnt hard the slightest pain cant exist unperceived as you know so any degree of heat that is a pain exists only in the mind we dont have to think the same for degrees of heat that are not pains i think you agreed a while back that no unperceiving being is capable of pleasure any more than it is of pain i did well isnt warmtha milder degree of heat than what causes discomfort or worsea pleasure what of it it follows that warmth cant exist outside the mind in any unperceiving substance or body so it seems so we have reached the position that degrees of heat that arent painful and also ones that are can exist only in a thinking substance cant we conclude from this that external bodies are absolutely incapable of any degree of heat whatsoever on second thoughts i am less sure that warmth is a pleasure than i am that intense heat is a pain i dont claim that warmth is as great a pleasure as heat is a pain but if you admit it to be even a small pleasure that is enough to yield my conclusion i could rather call it absence of pain it seems to be merely the lack of pain and of pleasure i hope you wont deny that this quality or state is one that an unthinking substance can have if you are determined to maintain that warmth is not a pleasure i dont know how to convince you otherwise except by appealing to your own experience but what do you think about cold the same as i do about heat an intense degree of cold is a pain for to feel a very great cold is to experience a great discomfort so it cant exist outside the mind but a lesser degree of cold can exist outside the mind as well as a lesser degree of heat so when we feel a moderate degree of heat or cold from a body that is applied to our skin we must conclude that that body has a moderate degree of heat or cold in it we must can any doctrine be true if it necessarily leads to absurdity certainly not isnt it an absurdity to think that a single thing should be at the same time both cold and warm it is well now suppose that one of your hands is hot and the other cold and that they are both at once plunged into a bowl of water that has a temperature between the two wont the water seem cold to one hand and warm to the other it will then doesnt it follow by your principles that the water really is both cold and warm at the same timethus believing something that you agree to be an absurdity i admit that that seems right so the principles themselves are false since you have admitted that no true principle leads to an absurdity but after all can anything be more absurd than to say that there is no heat in the fire to make the point still clearer answer me this in two cases that are exactly alike oughtnt we to make the same judgment we ought when a pin pricks your finger doesnt it tear and divide the fibres of your flesh it does and when hot coal burns your finger does it do any more it does not you hold that the pin itself doesnt contain either the sensation that it causes or anything like it so given what you have just agreed tonamely that like cases should be judged alikeyou ought to hold that the fire doesnt contain either the sensation that it causes or anything like it well since it must be so i am content to give up this point and admit that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our minds still there are plenty of other qualities through which to secure the reality of external things but what will you say hylas if it turns out that the same argument applies with regard to all other sensible qualities and that none of them can be supposed to exist outside the mind any more than heat and cold can proving that would be quite a feat but i see no chance of your doing so let us examine the other sensible qualities in order what about tastes do you think they exist outside the mind or not can anyone in his right mind doubt that sugar is sweet or that wormwood is bitter tell me hylas is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation or is it not it is and isnt bitterness some kind of discomfort or pain i grant that if therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal substances existing outside the mind how can sweetness and bitternessthat is pleasure and painbe in them hold on philonous now i see what has deluded me all this time you asked whether heat and cold sweetness and bitterness are particular sorts of pleasure and pain to which i answered simply that they are i should have answered by making a distinction those qualities as perceived by us are pleasures or pains but as existing in the external objects they are not so we cannot conclude without qualification that there is no heat in the fire or sweetness in the sugar but only that heat or sweetness as perceived by us are not in the fire or the sugar what do you say to this i say it is irrelevant we were talking only about sensible things which you defined as things we immediately perceive by our senses whatever other qualities you are talking about have no place in our conversation and i dont know anything about them you may indeed claim to have discovered certain qualities that you dont perceive and assert that they exist in fire and sugar but i cant for the life of me see how that serves your side in the argument we were having tell me then once more do you agree that heat and cold sweetness and bitterness meaning the qualities that are perceived by the senses dont exist outside the mind i see it is no use holding out so i give up the cause with respect to those four qualities though i must say it sounds odd to say that sugar isnt sweet it might sound better to you if you bear this in mind someone whose palate is diseased may experience as bitter stuff that at other times seems sweet to him and its perfectly obvious that different people perceive different tastes in the same food since what one man delights in another loathes how could this be if the taste were really inherent in the food i admit that i dont know how now think about odours dont they exactly fit what i have just been saying about tastes arent they just so many pleasing or displeasing sensations they are then can you conceive it to be possible that they should exist in an unperceiving thing i cannot or can you imagine that filth and excrement affect animals that choose to feed on them with the same smells that we perceive in them by no means then cant we conclude that smells like the other qualities we have been discussing cannot exist anywhere but in a perceiving substance or mind i think so what about sounds are they qualities really inherent in external bodies or not they dont inhere in the sounding bodies we know this because when a bell is struck in a vacuum it sends out no sound so the subject of sound must be the air explain that hylas when the air is set into motion we perceive a louder or softer sound in proportion to the airs motion but when the air is still we hear no sound at all granting that we never hear a sound except when some motion is produced in the air i still dont see how you can infer from this that the sound itself is in the air this motion in the external air is what produces in the mind the sensation of sound by striking on the eardrum it causes a vibration which is passed along the auditory nerves to the brain whereon the mind experiences the sensation called sound what is sound a sensation as i said as perceived by us it is a particular sensation in the mind and can any sensation exist outside the mind no certainly but if sound is a sensation how can it exist in the air if by the air you mean a senseless substance existing outside the mind philonous you must distinguish sound as it is perceived by us from sound as it is in itself orin other wordsdistinguish the sound we immediately perceive from the sound that exists outside us the former is indeed a particular kind of sensation but the latter is merely a vibration in the air i thought i had already flattened that distinction by the answer i gave when you were applying it in a similar case before but ill let that pass are you sure then that sound is really nothing but motion i am whatever is true of real sound therefore can truthfully be said of motion it may so it makes sense to speak of motion as something that is loud sweet piercing or lowpitched i see you are determined not to understand me isnt it obvious that those qualities belong only to sensible sound or sound in the ordinary everyday meaning of the word but not to sound in the real and scientific sense which as i have just explained is nothing but a certain motion of the air it seems then there are two sorts of soundthe common everyday sort that we hear and the scientific and real sort that we dont hear just so and the latter kind of sound consists in motion as i told you tell me hylas which of the senses do you think the idea of motion belongs to the sense of hearing certainly not to the senses of sight and touch it should follow then according to you that real sounds may possibly be seen or felt but can never be heard look philonous make fun of my views if you want to but that wont alter the truth of things i admit that the inferences you draw from them sound a little odd but ordinary language is formed by ordinary people for their own use so its not surprising if statements that express exact scientific notions seem clumsy and strange is it come to that i assure you i think i have scored a pretty big win when you so casually depart from ordinary phrases and opinions because what we were mainly arguing about was whose notions are furthest from the common road and most in conflict with what people in general think your claim that real sounds are never heard and that we get our idea of sound through some other sensecan you think that this is merely an oddsounding scientific truth isnt something in it contrary to nature and the truth of things frankly i dont like it either given the concessions i have already made i had better admit that sounds also have no real existence outside the mind and i hope you wont stick at admitting the same of colours pardon me the case of colours is very different can anything be more obvious than the fact that we see colours on the objects the objects you speak of are i suppose corporeal substances existing outside the mind they are and they have true and real colours inhering in them each visible object has the colour that we see in it hah is there anything visible other than what we perceive by sight there is not and do we perceive anything by our senses that we dont perceive immediately how often do i have to say it i tell you we do not bear with me hylas and tell me yet again whether anything is immediately perceived by the senses other than sensible qualities i know you asserted that nothing is but i want to know now whether you still think so i do now is your corporeal substance either a sensible quality or made up of sensible qualities what a question to ask who ever thought it was here is why i ask when you say that each visible object has the colour that we see in it you imply that either visible objects are sensible qualities or else something other than sensible qualities can be perceived by sight but we earlier agreed that is false and you still think it is so we are left with the thesis that visible objects are sensible qualities now in this conversation you have been taking it that visible objects are corporeal substances and so we reach the conclusion that your corporeal substances are nothing but sensible qualities you may draw as many absurd consequences as you please and try to entangle the plainest things but you will never persuade me out of my senses i clearly understand my own meaning i wish you would make me understand it too but since you dont want me to look into your notion of corporeal substance i shall drop that point but please tell me whether the colours that we see are the very ones that exist in external bodies or some other colours they are the very same ones oh then are the beautiful red and purple that we see on those clouds over there really in them or do you rather think that the clouds in themselves are nothing but a dark mist or vapour i must admit philonous that those colours arent really in the clouds as they seem to be at this distance they are only apparent colours apparent call you them how are we to distinguish these apparent colours from real ones very easily when a colour appears only at a distance and vanishes when one comes closer it is merely apparent and i suppose that real colours are ones that are revealed by looking carefully from close up right does the closest and most careful way of looking use a microscope or only the naked eye a microscope of course but a microscope often reveals colours in an object different from those perceived by unassisted sight and if we had microscopes that could magnify to as much as we liked it is certain that no object whatsoever when seen through them would appear with the same colour that it presents to the naked eye well what do you conclude from that you cant argue that there are really and naturally no colours on objects just because we can contrive artificial ways to alter them or make them vanish it can obviously be inferred from your own concessions i think that all the colours we see with our naked eyes are only apparentlike those on the cloudssince they vanish when one looks more closely and accurately as one can with a microscope and to anticipate your next objection i ask you whether the real and natural state of an object is revealed better by a very sharp and piercing sight or by one that is less sharp by the former without doubt isnt it plain from the science of optics that microscopes make the sight more penetrating and represent objects as they would appear to the eye if it were naturally endowed with extreme sharpness it is so the microscopic representation of a thing should be regarded as the one that best displays the things real nature or what the thing is in itself so the colours perceived through a microscope are more genuine and real than those perceived in any other way i admit that theres something in what you say besides its not only possible but clearly true that there actually are animals whose eyes are naturally formed to perceive things that are too small for us to see what do you think about those inconceivably small animals that we perceive through microscopes must we suppose they are all totally blind if they can see dont we have to suppose that their sight has the same use in preserving their bodies from injuries as eyesight does in all other animals if it does have that use isnt it obvious that they must see particles that are smaller than their own bodies which will present them with a vastly different view of each object from the view that strikes our senses even our own eyes dont always represent objects to us in the same way everyone knows that to someone suffering from jaundice all things seem yellow so isnt it highly probable that animals whose eyes we see to be differently structured from ours and whose bodily fluids are unlike ours dont see the same colours as we do in every object from all of this shouldnt it seem to follow that all colours are equally apparent and that none of the ones that we see are really in any outer object it should to put it past all doubt consider the following if colours were real properties or qualities inhering in external bodies they couldnt be altered except by some alteration in the very bodies themselves but isnt it evident that the colours of an object can be changed or made to disappear entirely through the use of a microscope or some change in the fluids in the eye or a change in the viewing distance without any sort of real alteration in the thing itself indeed even when all the other factors remain unaltered some objects present different colours to the eye depending on the angle from which they are looked at the same thing happens when we view an object in different brightnesses of light and everyone knows that the same bodies appear differently coloured by candlelight from what they do in daylight add to these facts our experience of a prism which separates the different rays of light and thereby alters the colour of an object causing the whitest object to appear deep blue or red to the naked eye now tell me whether you still think that each body has its true real colour inhering in it if you think it has i want to know what particular distance and orientation of the object what special condition of the eye what intensity or kind of light is needed for discovering that true colour and distinguishing it from the apparent ones i admit to being quite convinced that they are all equally apparent that no such thing as colour really inheres in external bodies and that colour is wholly in the light what confirms me in this opinion is the fact that colours are more or less vivid depending on the brightness of the light and that when there is no light no colours are seen furthermore if there were colours in external objects how could we possibly perceive them no external body affects the mind unless it acts first on our senseorgans and the only action of bodies is motion and this cant be communicated except in collisions so a distant object cant act on the eye and so cant enable itself or its properties to be perceived by the mind from this it plainly follows that what immediately causes the perception of colours is some substance that is in contact with the eyesuch as light what is light a substance i tell you philonous external light is simply a thin fluid substance whose tiny particles when agitated with a brisk motion and in various ways reflected to the eyes from the different surfaces of outer objects cause different motions in the optic nerves these motions are passed along to the brain where they cause various states and events and these are accompanied by the sensations of red blue yellow etc it seems then that all the light does is to shake the optic nerves that is all and as a result of each particular motion of the nerves the mind is affected with a sensation which is some particular colour right and these sensations have no existence outside the mind they have not then how can you say that colours are in the light since you take light to be a corporeal substance external to the mind light and colours as immediately perceived by us cannot exist outside the mind i admit that but in themselves they are only the motions and arrangements of certain insensible particles of matter colours then in the ordinary sensethat is understood to be the immediate objects of sightcannot be had by any substance that doesnt perceive that is what i say well then you give up your position as regards those sensible qualities which are what all mankind takes to be colours think what you like about the scientists invisible colours it is not my business to argue about them but i suggest that you consider whether it is wise for you in a discussion like this one to affirm that the red and blue we see are not real colours and that certain unknown motions and shapes which no man ever did or could see are real colours arent these shocking notions and arent they open to as many ridiculous inferences as those you had to give up in the case of sounds i have to admit philonous that i cant keep this up any longer colours sounds tastesin a word all that are termed secondary qualitieshave no existence outside the mind but in granting this i dont take anything away from the reality of matter or external objects because various philosophers maintain what i just did about secondary qualities and yet are the far from denying matter in this context philosophers means philosophers and scientists to make this clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities into primary and secondary primary qualities are extendedness shape solidity gravity motion and rest they hold that these really exist in bodies secondary qualities are all the sensible qualities that arent primary and the philosophers assert that these are merely sensations or ideas existing nowhere but in the mind no doubt you are already aware of all this for my part i have long known that such an opinion was current among philosophers but i was never thoroughly convinced of its truth till now so you still believe that extension and shapes are inherent in external unthinking substances here extension could mean extendedness or it could mean size i do but what if the arguments that are brought against secondary qualities hold against these also why then i shall have to think that shape and extension also exist only in the mind is it your opinion that the very shape and extension that you perceive by sense exist in the outer object or material substance it is have all other animals as good reason as you do to think that the shape and extension that they see and feel is in the outer object surely they do if they can think at all tell me hylas do you think that the senses were given to all animals for their preservation and wellbeing in life or were they given only to men for that end i dont doubt that they have the same use in all other animals if so mustnt their senses enable them to perceive their own limbs and to perceive bodies that are capable of harming them certainly a tiny insect therefore must be supposed to see its own foot and other things of that size or even smaller seeing them all as bodies of considerable size even though you can see themif at allonly as so many visible points i cant deny that and to creatures even smaller than that insect they will seem even bigger they will so that something you can hardly pick out because it is so small will appear like a huge mountain to an extremely tiny animal i agree about all this can a single thing have different sizes at the same time it would be absurd to think so but from what you have said it follows that the true size of the insects foot is the size you see it having and the size the insect sees it as having and all the sizes it is seen as having by animals that are even smaller that is to say your own principles have led you into an absurdity i seem to be in some difficulty about this another point didnt you agree that no real inherent property of any object can be changed unless the thing itself alters i did but as we move towards or away from an object its visible size varies being at one distance ten or a hundred times greater than at another doesnt it follow from this too that size isnt really inherent in the object i admit that i dont know what to think you will soon be able to make up your mind if you will venture to think as freely about this quality as you have about the others didnt you admit that it was legitimate to infer that neither heat nor cold was in the water from the premise that the water seemed warm to one hand and cold to the other i did isnt it the very same reasoning to infer that there is no size or shape in an object from the premise that to one eye it seems little smooth and round while to the other eye it appears big uneven and angular the very same but does the latter ever happen you can at any time find out that it does by looking with one eye bare and with the other through a microscope i dont know how to maintain it yet i am reluctant to give up extension size because i see so many odd consequences following from the concession that extension isnt in the outer object odd you say after the things you have already agreed to i hope you wont be put off from anything just because it is odd but in any case wouldnt it seem very odd if the general reasoning that covers all the other sensible qualities didnt apply also to extension if you agree that no idea or anything like an idea can exist in an unperceiving substance then surely it follows that no shape or mode of extension or specific way of being extended that we can have any idea ofin perceiving or imaginingcan be really inherent in matter whether the sensible quality is shape or sound or colour or what you will it seems impossible that any of these should subsist in something that doesnt perceive it not to mention the peculiar difficulty there must be in conceiving a material substance prior to and distinct from extension to be the substratum of extension ill say more about that shortly i give up on this point for just now but i reserve the right to retract my opinion if i later discover that i was led to it by a false step that is a right you cant be denied shapes and extendedness being disposed of we proceed next to motion can a real motion in any external body be at the same time both very swift and very slow it cannot isnt the speed at which a body moves inversely proportional to the time it takes to go any given distance thus a body that travels a mile in an hour moves three times as fast as it would if it travelled only a mile in three hours i agree with you and isnt time measured by the succession of ideas in our minds it is and isnt it possible that ideas should succeed one another twice as fast in your mind as they do in mine or in the mind of some kind of nonhuman spirit i agree about that consequently the same body may seem to another spirit to make its journey in half the time that it seems to you to take half is just an example any other fraction would make the point just as well that is to say according to your view that both of the perceived motions are in the object a single body can really move both very swiftly and very slowly at the same time how is this consistent either with common sense or with what you recently agreed to i have nothing to say to it now for solidity if you dont use solidity to name any sensible quality then it is irrelevant to our enquiry if you do use it to name a sensible quality the quality must be either hardness or resistance but each of these is plainly relative to our senses it is obvious that what seems hard to one animal may appear soft to another that has greater force and firmness of limbs and it is equally obvious that the resistance i feel when i press against a body is not in the body i agree that the sensation of resistance which is all you immediately perceive is not in the body but the cause of that sensation is but the causes of our sensations arent immediately perceived and therefore arent sensible i thought we had settled this point i admit that we did excuse me if i seem a little embarrassed i am having trouble quitting my earlier views it may be a help for you to consider this point once extendedness is admitted to have no existence outside the mind the same must be granted for motion solidity and gravity since obviously they all presuppose extendedness so it is superfluous to enquire into each of them separately in denying extendedness you have denied them all to have any real existence if this is right philonous i wonder why the philosophers who deny the secondary qualities any real existence should yet attribute it to the primary qualities if theres no difference between them how can this be accounted for it isnt my business to account for every opinion of the philosophers but there are many possible explanations one of them being that those philosophers were influenced by the fact that pleasure and pain are associated with the secondary qualities rather than with the primary ones heat and cold tastes and smells have something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than what we get from the ideas of extendedness shape and motion and since it is too visibly absurd to hold that pain or pleasure can be in an unperceiving substance men have more easily been weaned from believing in the external existence of the secondary qualities than of the primary ones you will see that there is something in this if you recall the distinction you made between moderate heat and intense heat allowing one a real existence outside the mind while denying it to the other but after all there is no rational basis for that distinction for surely a sensation that is neither pleasing nor painful is just as much a sensation as one that is pleasing or painful so neither kind should be supposed to exist in an unthinking subject it has just come into my head philonous that i have somewhere heard of a distinction between absolute and sensible extendedness granted that large and small consist merely in the relation other extended things have to the parts of our own bodies and so arent really in the substances themselves still we dont have to say the same about absolute extendedness which is something abstracted from large and small from this or that particular size and shape similarly with motion fast and slow are altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own minds but just because those special cases of motion do not exist outside the mind it doesnt follow that the same is true of the absolute motion that is abstracted from them what distinguishes one instance of motion or of extendedness from another isnt it something sensiblefor instance some speed or some size and shape i think so so these qualitiesnamely absolute motion and absolute extendednesswhich are stripped of all sensible properties have no features making them more specific in any way that is right that is to say they are extendedness in general and motion in general if you say so but everyone accepts the maxim that every thing that exists is particular how then can motion in general or extendedness in general exist in any corporeal substance i will need time to think about that i think the point can be speedily decided without doubt you can tell whether you are able to form this or that idea in your mind now im willing to let our present dispute be settled in the following way if you can form in your thoughts a distinct abstract idea of motion or extendedness having none of those sensible qualitiesswift and slow large and small round and square and the likewhich we agree exist only in the mind then ill capitulate but if you cant it will be unreasonable for you to insist any longer on something of which you have no notion to be frank i cannot can you even separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from the ideas of all the socalled secondary qualities what isnt it easy to consider extendedness and motion by themselves abstracted from all other sensible qualities isnt that how the mathematicians handle them i acknowledge hylas that it is not difficult to form general propositions and reasonings about extendedness and motion without mentioning any other qualities and in that sense to treat them abstractedly i can pronounce the word motion by itself but how does it follow from this that i can form in my mind the idea of motion without an idea of body theorems about extension and shapes can be proved without any mention of large or small or any other sensible quality but how does it follow from this that the mind can form and grasp an abstract idea of extension without any particular size or shape or other sensible quality mathematicians study quantity disregarding any other sensible qualities that go with it on the grounds that they are irrelevant to the proofs but when they lay aside the words and contemplate the bare ideas i think youll find that they arent the pure abstracted ideas of extendedness but what do you say about pure intellect cant abstracted ideas be formed by that faculty since i cant form abstract ideas at all it is clearly impossible for me to form them with help from pure intellect whatever faculty you mean that phrase to refer to setting aside questions about the nature of pure intellect and its spiritual objects such as virtue reason god etc i can say this much that seems clearly true sensible things can only be perceived by the senses or represented by the imagination so shape and size dont belong to pure intellect because they are initially perceived through the senses if you want to be surer about this try and see if you can frame the idea of any shape abstracted from all particularities of size and from other sensible qualities let me think a littlei dont find that i can well can you think it possible that something might really exist in nature when it implies a contradiction in its conception by no means therefore since even the mind cant possibly separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from all other sensible qualities doesnt it follow that where the former exist the latter must also exist it would seem so consequently the very same arguments that you agreed to be decisive against the secondary qualities need no extra help to count just as strongly against the primary qualities also besides if you trust your senses dont they convince you that all sensible qualities coexist that is that they all appear to the senses as being in the same place do your senses ever represent a motion or shape as being divested of all other visible and tangible qualities you neednt say any more about this i freely admit unless there has been some hidden error or oversight in our discussion up to herethat all sensible qualities should alike be denied existence outside the mind but i fear that i may have been too free in my former concessions or overlooked some fallacy in your line of argument in short i didnt take time to think as to that hylas take all the time you want to go back over our discussion you are at liberty to repair any slips you have made or to support your initial opinion by presenting arguments that you have so far overlooked i think it was a big oversight on my part that i failed to distinguish sufficiently the object from the sensation the sensation cannot exist outside the mind but it doesnt follow that the object cannot either what object do you mean the object of the senses exactly so it is immediately perceived right explain to me the difference between what is immediately perceived and a sensation i take the sensation to be an act of the perceiving mind beside which there is something perceived which i call the object of the act for example there is red and yellow on that tulip but the act of perceiving those colours is in me only and not in the tulip what tulip are you talking about is it the one that you see the same and what do you see beside colour shape and extendedness nothing so you would say that the red and yellow are coexistent with the extension wouldnt you yes and i go further i say that they have a real existence outside the mind in some unthinking substance that the colours are really in the tulip which i see is obvious nor can it be denied that this tulip may exist independently of your mind or mine but that any immediate object of the sensesthat is any idea or combination of ideasshould exist in an unthinking substance or exterior to all minds is in itself an obvious contradiction nor can i imagine how it follows from what you said just now namely that the red and yellow are in the tulip you saw since you dont claim to see that unthinking substance you are skillful at changing the subject philonous i see that you dont want me to push on in that direction so lets return to your distinction between sensation and object if i understand you correctly you hold that in every perception there are two things of which one is an action of the mind and the other is not true and this action cant exist in or belong to any unthinking thing but whatever else is involved in a perception may do so that is my position so that if there were a perception without any act of the mind that perception could exist in an unthinking substance i grant that but it is impossible that there should be such a perception when is the mind said to be active when it produces puts an end to or changes anything can the mind produce discontinue or change anything in any way except by an act of the will it cannot so the mind is to count as being active in its perceptions to the extent that volition is included in them it is when i pluck this flower i am active because i do it by a handmovement which arose from my volition so likewise in holding it up to my nose but is either of these smelling no i also act when i draw air through my nose because my breathing in that manner rather than otherwise is an effect of my volition but this isnt smelling either for if it were i would smell every time i breathed in that manner true smelling then is a result of all this plucking holding up and breathing in it is but i dont find that my will is involved any further that is in anything other than the plucking holding up and breathing in whatever else happensincluding my perceiving a smellis independent of my will and i am wholly passive with respect to it is it different in your case hylas no its just the same now consider seeing isnt it in your power to open your eyes or keep them shut to turn them this way or that without doubt but does it similarly depend on your will that when you look at this flower you perceive white rather than some other colour when you direct your open eyes towards that part of the sky can you avoid seeing the sun or is light or darkness the effect of your volition no certainly in these respects then you are altogether passive i am tell me now does seeing consist in perceiving light and colours or rather in opening and turning the eyes the former certainly well then since in the actual perception of light and colours you are altogether passive what has become of that action that you said was an ingredient in every sensation and doesnt it follow from your own concessions that the perception of light and colourswhich doesnt involve any actioncan exist in an unperceiving substance and isnt this a plain contradiction i dont know what to think furthermore since you distinguish active and passive elements in every perception you must do it in the perception of pain but how could painhowever inactive it ispossibly exist in an unperceiving substance think about it and then tell me frankly arent light and colours tastes sounds etc all equally passions or sensations in the mind you may call them external objects and give them in words whatever kind of existence you like but examine your own thoughts and then tell me whether i am not right i admit philonous that when i look carefully at what goes on in my mind all i can find is that i am a thinking being that has a variety of sensations and i cant conceive how a sensation could exist in an unperceiving substance but when on the other hand i look in a different way at sensible things considering them as so many properties and qualities i find that i have to suppose a material substratum without which they cant be conceived to exist material substratum you call it tell me please which of your senses acquainted you with it it is not itself sensible only its properties and qualities are perceived by the senses i presume then that you obtained the idea of it through reflection and reason i dont claim to have any proper positive idea of it here positive means nonrelational hylas means that he doesnt have an idea that represents what material substance is like in itself but i conclude that it exists because qualities cant be conceived to exist without a support so it seems that you have only a relative notion of material substance you conceive it only by conceiving how it relates to sensible qualities right tell me please what that relation is isnt it sufficiently expressed in the term substratum or substance one is latin and means underneath layer the other comes from latin meaning standing under if so the word substratum should mean that it is spread under the sensible qualities true and consequently spread under extendedness i agree so in its own nature it is entirely distinct from extendedness i tell you extendedness is only a quality and matter is something that supports qualities and isnt it obvious that the supported thing is different from the supporting one so something distinct from extendedness and not including it is supposed to be the substratum of extendedness just so tell me hylas can a thing be spread without being extended isnt the idea of extendedness necessarily included in that of spreading it is so anything that you suppose to be spread under something else must have in itself an extendedness distinct from the extendedness of the thing under which it is spread it must consequently every bodily substance being the substratum of extendedness must have in itself another extendedness which qualifies it to be a substratum and that extendedness must also have something spread under it a subsubstratum so to speak and so on to infinity isnt this absurd in itself as well as conflicting with what you have just said namely that the substratum was something distinct from extendedness and not including it yes but philonous you misunderstand me i dont mean that matter is spread in a crude literal sense under extension the word substratum is used only to express in general the same thing as substance well then let us examine the relation implied in the term substance is it not the relation of standing under qualities the very same but doesnt a thing have to be extended if it is to stand under or support another yes so isnt this supposition infected with the same absurdity as the previous one you still take things in a strict literal sense that isnt fair philonous i dont want to force any meaning onto your words you are free to explain them as you please but please make me understand something by them you tell me that matter supports or stands under accidents how as your legs support your body no that is the literal sense please let me know any sense literal or not literal that you understand it inhow long must i wait for an answer hylas i dont know what to say i once thought i understood well enough what was meant by matters supporting qualities but now the more i think about it the less i understand it in short i find that i dont know anything about it so it seems that you have no idea at all either positive or relative of matter you dont know what it is in itself or what relation it has to qualities i admit it and yet you said that you couldnt conceive the real existence of qualities without conceiving at the same time a material support for them i did that amounted to saying that when you conceive the real existence of qualities you also conceive something that you cant conceive it was wrong i admit but still i fear there is some fallacy or other let me try this it has just occurred to me that we were both led into error by your treating each quality by itself i grant that no quality can exist on its own outside the mind colour cant exist without extension nor can shape exist without some other sensible quality but as a number of qualities united or blended together constitute an entire sensible thing there is no obstacle to supposing that such thingsthat is such collections of qualitiescan exist outside the mind are you joking hylas or do you have a very bad memory we did indeed go through all the qualities by name one after another but my argumentsor rather your concessionsnowhere tended to prove that the secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind in isolation the point was rather that secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind at all its true that existinginisolation did come up in our discussion in discussing shape and motion we concluded they couldnt exist outside the mind because it was impossible even in thought to separate them from all secondary qualities so as to conceive them existing by themselves but this wasnt the only argument i used on that occasion however if you like we can set aside our whole conversation up to here counting it as nothing i am willing to let our whole debate be settled as follows if you can conceive it to be possible for any mixture or combination of qualities or any sensible object whatever to exist outside the mind then i will grant it actually to be so by that test the point will soon be decided what is easier than to conceive a tree or house existing by itself independently of and unperceived by any mind whatsoever i conceive them existing in that way right now tell me hylas can you see a thing which is at the same time unseen no that would be a contradiction is it not as great a contradiction to talk of conceiving a thing which is unconceived it is the tree or house therefore which you think of is conceived by you how could it be otherwise and what is conceived is surely in the mind without question what is conceived is in the mind then what led you to say that you conceived a house or tree existing independently and out of all minds whatsoever that was an oversight i admit but give me a moment to think about what led me into it it wasi now realize after reflectionan amusing mistake as i was thinking of a tree in a solitary place with nobody there to see it i thought that was conceiving a tree as existing unperceived or unthought of overlooking the fact i myself conceived it all the while but now i plainly see that all i can do is to form ideas in my own mind i can conceive in my own thoughts the idea of a tree or a house or a mountain but that is all and this is far from proving that i can conceive them existing out of the minds of all spirits you agree then that you cant conceive how any corporeal sensible thing should exist otherwise than in a mind i do and yet you will earnestly contend for the truth of something that you cant even conceive i admit that i dont know what to think but i still have doubts isnt it certain that i see things at a distance dont we perceive the stars and moon for example to be a long way away isnt this i say obvious to the senses dont you in dreams also perceive objects like those i do and dont they then appear in the same way to be distant they do but do you conclude that the apparitions in a dream are outside the mind by no means then you ought not to conclude that sensible objects seen when you are awake are outside the mind from their appearance or the manner in which you perceive them i admit that but doesnt my visual sense deceive me in those cases by telling me that sensible objects are at a distance when really they are not by no means neither eyesight nor reason inform you that the idea or thing that you immediately perceive actually exists outside the mind by eyesight you know only that you are affected with certain sensations of light and colours etc and you wont say that these are outside the mind true but all the same dont you think that eyesight makes some suggestion of outerness or distance when you approach a distant object do the visible size and shape keep changing or do they appear the same at all distances they are in a continual change so sight doesnt suggest or in any way inform you that the visible object you immediately perceive exists at a distance or that it will be perceived when you move further forward because there is a continued series of visible objects succeeding each other during the whole time of your approach i agree about that but still i know on seeing an object what object i shall see after i have gone a certain distancenever mind whether it is exactly the same object or not so something about distance is still being suggested my dear hylas just think about that a little and then tell me whether there is anything more to it that this from the ideas that you actually perceive by sight you have by experience learned to infer in accordance with the general rules of nature what other ideas you will experience after such and such a succession of time and motion upon the whole i think thats what it comes down to isnt it obvious that if a man born blind were suddenly enabled to see he would start with no experience of what may be suggested by sight it is so he would not according to you have any notion of distance linked to the things he saw he would take the latter to be a new set of sensations existing only in his mind that is undeniable but to make it still more plain isnt distance a line running out from the eye it is can a line so situated be perceived by sight it cannot so doesnt it follow that distance isnt strictly and immediately perceived by sight it seems so again do you think that colours are at a distance i have to acknowledge that they are only in the mind but dont colours appear to the eye as coexisting at the same place as extension and shape they do then how can you conclude from the deliverances of sight that shapes do exist outside the mind when you agree that colours dont the sensible appearances of both are the very same i dont know what to answer even if distance were truly and immediately perceived by the mind it still wouldnt follow that it existed out of the mind for whatever is immediately perceived is an idea and can any idea exist out of the mind it would be absurd to suppose so but tell me philonous can we perceive or know nothing except our ideas set aside what we may know through the rational deducing of causes from effects that is irrelevant to our enquiry as for the senses you are the best judge of whether you perceive anything that you dont immediately perceive and i ask you are the things you immediately perceive anything but your own sensations or ideas in the course of this conversation you have more than once declared yourself on those two points this latest question of yours seems to indicate that you have changed your mind to tell you the truth philonous i think there are two kinds of objects one kind perceived immediately and called ideas the other kind are real things or external objects perceived by the mediation of ideas which resemble and represent them now i grant that ideas dont exist outside the mind but the second sort of objects do i am sorry i didnt think of this distinction sooner it would probably have cut short your discourse are those external objects perceived by sense or by some other faculty they are perceived by sense what is there anything perceived by sense that isnt immediately perceived yes philonous there isin a way for example when i look at a picture or statue of julius caesar i may be said to perceive him in a fashion though not immediately by my senses you seem to hold then that our ideas which are all that we immediately perceive are pictures of external things and that the latter are also perceived by sense because they have a conformity or resemblance to our ideas that is my meaning and in the same way that julius caesar in himself invisible is nevertheless perceived by sight so also real things in themselves imperceptible are perceived by sense in the very same way tell me hylas when you look at the picture of julius caesar do you see with your eyes anything more than some colours and shapes with a certain symmetry and composition of the whole nothing else and wouldnt a man who had never known anything about julius caesar see as much he would so he has his sight and the use of it as perfectly as you have yours i agree with you then why are your thoughts directed to the roman emperor while his are not this cant come from the sensations or ideas of sense that you perceive at that moment for you have agreed that you have in that respect no advantage over the man who has never heard of julius caesar so it seems that the direction of your thoughts comes from reason and memorydoesnt it it does so that example of yours doesnt show that anything is perceived by sense that isnt immediately perceived i dont deny that we can be said in a certain sense to perceive sensible things mediately by sense that is when the immediate perception of ideas by one sense suggests to the mind others perhaps belonging to another sense of a kind that have often been perceived to go with ideas of the former kind for instance when i hear a coach drive along the streets all that i immediately perceive is the sound but from my past experience that such a sound is connected with a coach i am said to hear the coach still it is obvious that in truth and strictness nothing can be heard but sound and the coach in that example is not strictly perceived by sense but only suggested from experience similarly when we are said to see a redhot bar of iron the solidity and heat of the iron are not the objects of sight but are suggested to the imagination by the colour and shape that are strictly perceived by that sense in short the only things that are actually and strictly perceived by any sense are the ones that would have been perceived even if we had only just acquired that sense and were using it for the first time as for other things clearly they are only suggested to the mind by past experience but to return to your comparison of imperceptible real things with caesars picture obviously if you keep to this youll have to hold that the real things that our ideas copy are perceived not by sense but by some internal faculty of the soul such as reason or memory i would be interested to know what arguments reason gives you for the existence of your real things or material objects or whether you remember seeing them formerly not as copied by your ideas but as they are in themselves or if you have heard or read of anyone else who did i can see that you want to make fun of me philonous but that will never convince me all i want is to learn from you how to come by knowledge of material things whatever we perceive is perceived either immediately by sense or mediately by reason and reflection but you have excluded sense so please show me what reason you have to believe in their existence or what means you can possibly adopt to prove to my understanding or your own that they exist to be perfectly frank philonous now that i think about it i cant find any good reason for my position but it seems pretty clear that its at least possible that such things really exist and as long as there is no absurdity in supposing them i shall continue in my belief until you bring good reasons to the contrary what has it come to this that you believe in the existence of material objects and that this belief is based on the mere possibility of its being true then you challenge me to bring reasons against it though some people would think that the burden of proof lies with him who holds the affirmative position anyway this very thesis that you are now determined to maintain without any reason is in effect one that you havemore than once during this conversationseen good reason to give up but let us set all that aside if i understand you rightly you say our ideas dont exist outside the mind but that they are copies likenesses or representations of certain originals that do you have me right our ideas then are like external things they are do those external things have a stable and permanent nature independently of our senses or do they keep changing as we move our bodies and do things with our faculties or organs of sense real things obviously have a fixed and real nature which remains the same through any changes in our senses or in how our bodies are placed or how they move such changes may indeed affect the ideas in our minds but it would be absurd to think they had the same effect on things existing outside the mind how then can things that are perpetually fleeting and variable as our ideas are be copies or likenesses of any thing that is fixed and constant since all sensible qualitiessize shape colour etcthat is our ideas are continually changing with every alteration in the distance medium or instruments of sensation how can any fixed material object be properly represented or depicted by several distinct things or ideas each of which is so unlike the others or if you say that the object resembles just one of our ideas how can we distinguish that true copy from all the false ones i have to admit philonous that i am at a loss i dont know what to say to this there is more are material objects in themselves perceptible or imperceptible properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but ideas all material things therefore are in themselves insensible and can be perceived only through ideas of them ideas are sensible then and their originalsthe things they are copies ofare insensible right but how can something that is sensible be like something that is insensible can a real thing in itself invisible be like a colour can a real thing that isnt audible be like a sound in a word can anything be like a sensation or idea but another sensation or idea i must admit that i think not can there possibly be any doubt about this dont you perfectly know your own ideas yes i know them perfectly for something that i dont perceive or know cant be any part of my idea well then examine your ideas and then tell me if theres anything in them that could exist outside the mind or if you can conceive anything like them existing outside the mind upon looking into it i find that i cant conceive or understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea and it is most evident that no idea can exist outside the mind so youre forced by your own principles to deny the reality of sensible things because you made it consist in an absolute existence outside the mind that is to say you are a downright sceptic so i have met my target which was to show that your principles lead to scepticism for the present i am if not entirely convinced at least silenced i wonder what more you would require in order to be perfectly convinced havent you been free to explain yourself in any way you liked were any little conversational slips held against you werent you allowed to retract or reinforce anything you had previously said as best served your purpose hasnt everything you could say been heard and examined with all the fairness imaginable in a word havent you on every point been convinced out of your own mouth and if you can now discover any flaw in any of your former concessions or think of any remaining tactic any new distinction shading or comment whatsoever why dont you produce it a little patience philonous i am at present so bewildered to see myself entangled and as it were imprisoned in the labyrinths you have led me into that i cant be expected to find my way out on the spur of the moment you must give me time to look around me and recollect myself listenisnt that the collegebell let us go in and meet here again tomorrow morning in the mean time you can think about this mornings conversation and see if you can find any fallacy in it or invent any new means to extricate yourself agreed the second dialogue hylas i beg your pardon philonous for not meeting you sooner all this morning my head was so filled with our recent conversation that i didnt notice the time of the day or indeed anything else philonous i am glad you were so focussed on it i hope that if there were any mistakes in your concessions or fallacies in my reasonings from them you will now show them to me i assure you ever since i saw you i have done nothing but search for mistakes and fallacies and with that in mind i have examined in detail the whole course of yesterdays conversation but it has all been useless for the views i was led into in the conversation seemed even clearer and more obvious when i reviewed them today and the more i think about them the more irresistibly they force my assent to them dont you think that this is a sign that they are genuine and that they proceed from nature and are in accordance with right reason truth and beauty have this in common they both show to advantage when looked at closely and carefully the false glitter of error and heavy makeup cant endure being looked at for too long or from too close up i admit there is a great deal in what you say and i am as convinced as anyone could be of the truth of those strange consequences that you argued for yesterday so long as i keep in mind the reasonings that lead to them but when those arguments are out of my thoughts my mind goes the other way there seems to be something so satisfactory natural and intelligible in the modern way of explaining things that i confess that i dont know how to reject it i dont know what way you mean i mean the modern way of accounting for our sensations or ideas how does it do that it is supposed that the mind resides in some part of the brain from which the nerves originate spreading out from there to all parts of the body that outer objects act in different ways on the senseorgans starting up certain vibrations in the nerves that the nerves pass these vibrations along to the brain where the mind is located and that the mind is variously affected with ideas according to the various impressions or traces the vibrations make in the brain and call you this an explanation of how we are affected with ideas why not philonous have you any objection to it i need to know first whether i have rightly understood your modern hypothesis according to it certain traces in the brain are the causes or occasions of our ideas the special meaning of occasion that is at work here will be explained on page it doesnt matter in the mean time tell me please do you mean by the brain a sensible thing what else do you think i could possibly mean sensible things are all immediately perceivable and things that are immediately perceivable are ideas and these exist only in the mind this much if i am not mistaken you have long since agreed to i dont deny it so the brain that you speak of being a sensible thing exists only in the mind i would like to know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that one idea or thing existing in the mind occasions all the other ideas and if you do think this how do you account for the origin of that primary idea or brain itself i dont explain the origin of our ideas by the brain which is perceivable to sense because it is as you say only a combination of sensible ideas i am talking about another brain which i imagine but arent imagined things just as much in the mind as perceived things are i must admit that they are so the difference between perceiving and imagining isnt important you have been accounting for ideas by certain motions or impressions in the brain that is by some alterations in an ideaand it doesnt matter whether it is sensible or imaginable i begin to suspect my hypothesis apart from spirits our own ideas are the only things we know or conceive so when you say that all ideas are occasioned by impressions in the brain do you conceive this brain or not if you do then you talk of ideas imprinted on an idea causing that same idea which is absurd if you dont conceive it you talk unintelligibly instead of forming a reasonable hypothesis i can now see clearly that it was a mere dream there is nothing in it its no great loss for after all this way of explaining things as you called it could never have satisfied any reasonable man what connection is there between a vibration in the nerves and sensations of sound or colour in the mind how could one possibly cause the other but i could never have seen it as being so empty as it now seems to be well then are you finally satisfied that no sensible things have a real existence and that you are in truth a complete sceptic it is too plain to be denied look arent the fields covered with a delightful green isnt there something in the woods and groves in the rivers and clear springs that soothes delights transports the soul at the view of the wide and deep ocean or some huge mountain whose top is lost in the clouds or of an old gloomy forest arent our minds filled with a pleasing horror even in rocks and deserts isnt there an agreeable wildness it is such a sincere pleasure to see earths natural beauties doesnt she preserve and renew our enjoyment of them by intermittently drawing the veil of over her face and doesnt she change her dress with the seasons how aptly the elements are disposed what variety and usefulness even in the lowest things that nature produces what delicacy what beauty what complexity of organization in the bodies of animals and plants how finely all things are suited to their particular ends and also to their roles as appropriate parts of the whole and while they mutually aid and support dont they also display each other in a better light raise now your thoughts from this globe of earth to all those glorious glittering objects that adorn the high arch of heaven the motion and situation of the planetsarent they admirably orderly have those globes ever been known to stray in their repeated journeys through pathless space doesnt each of them sweep out the same area between itself and the sun in any two equal periods of time so fixed and unchanging are the laws by which the unseen author of nature runs the universe how vivid and radiant is the shine of the fixed stars how magnificent and rich the careless profusion with which they seem to be scattered throughout the whole vault of the sky yet the telescope brings into view a new host of stars that escape the naked eye here they seem to be nearby and small but a closer view through a telescope shows them to be immense orbs of light at various distances sunk deep in the abyss of space now you must call imagination to your aid so as to get some imaginative picture of things you cant actually see our feeble limited senses cant pick out innumerable worlds planets revolving round the central fires suns in each of which the energy of an allperfect mind is displayed in endless forms so those are things you must simply imagine but neither sense nor imagination is big enough to take in the boundless extent of the universe with all its glittering furniture with all the hard work that we give to those two faculties exerting and straining each of them to its utmost reach theres always a vast surplus left ungrasped yet all the vast bodies that make up this mighty universe however distant they may be are by some secret mechanismsome divine power and artificelinked in a mutual dependence and interconnection with each other and with this earth which almost slipped out of my thoughts getting lost in the crowd of worlds isnt the whole system immense beautiful more glorious than we can say or think then how should we treat those philosophers who want to deprive these noble and delightful scenes of all reality how should we think of principles implying that all the visible beauty of the creation is a false imaginary glare to put it bluntly can you expect this scepticism of yours not to be thought extravagantly absurd by all reasonable people other men may think as they please but you have nothing to reproach me with my comfort is that you are as much a sceptic as i am there hylas i beg leave to differ from you what having along agreed to the premises are you now denying the conclusion and leaving me to maintain by myself these paradoxes that you led me into this surely isnt fair i deny that i agreed with you in those views that led to scepticism you indeed said that the reality of sensible things consisted in an absolute existence out of the minds of spirits or distinct from their being perceived and under the guidance of this notion of reality you are obliged to deny that sensible things have any real existence that is according to your own definition on page you declare yourself to be a sceptic but i didnt say and didnt think that the reality of sensible things should be defined in that manner to me it is evident for the reasons you agree to that sensible things cant exist except in a mind or spirit from this i conclude not that they have no real existence but thatseeing they dont depend on my thought and have an existence distinct from being perceived by methere must be some other mind in which they exist as sure as the sensible world really exists therefore so sure is there an infinite omnipresent spirit who contains and supports it what this is no more than i and all christians holdand indeed all nonchristians who believe there is a god and that he knows and understands everything yes but heres the difference men commonly believe that all things are known or perceived by god because they believe in the existence of a god whereas for me the order of reasons is reversed i immediately and necessarily conclude the existence of a god because all sensible things must be perceived by him as long as we all believe the same thing what does it matter how we come by that belief but we dont believe the same thing philosophers hold that god perceives all corporeal things but they attribute to such things an absolute existence independently of their being perceived by any mind whatever and i dont besides isnt there a difference between saying there is a god therefore he perceives all things and saying sensible things do really exist if they really exist they must be perceived by an infinite mind therefore there is an infinite mind or god this provides you with a direct and immediate proof from a most evident premise of the existence of a god theologians and philosophers had proved beyond all controversy from the beauty and usefulness of the various parts of the creation that it was the workmanship of god but some of us have the advantage that we can prove the existence of an infinite mind from the bare existence of the sensible world without getting help from astronomy and natural philosophy and without bringing in facts about how wonderfully the parts of the world relate to one another what gives us this advantage is just the simple thought that the sensible world is what we perceive by our various senses that nothing is perceived by the senses except ideas and that no idea and no thing of which an idea is a copy can exist otherwise than in a mind with that at your disposal you can now oppose and baffle the most strenuous advocate for atheism without any laborious search into the sciences without any sophisticated reasoning and without tediously long arguments this single reflection on impossibility that the visible world or any part of iteven the most lowgrade and shapeless part of itshould exist outside a mind is enough to overthrow the whole system of atheism it destroys those miserable refuges of the atheist the eternal succession of unthinking causes and effects or the chance coming together of atomsthose wild fantasies of vanini hobbes and spinoza let any one of those supporters of impiety look into his own thoughts and see if he can conceive how so much as a rock a desert a chaos or a confused jumble of atomshow anything at all either sensible or imaginablecan exist independently of a mind and he need go no further to be convinced of his folly can anything be fairer than to let the disagreement be settled by the outcome of such a test leaving it to the atheist himself to see if he can conceive even in thought the state of affairs that he holds to be true in fact it is undeniable that there is something highly serviceable to religion in the position you are taking but dont you think it looks very like the view of some eminent recent philosophersnotably malebranchethat we see all things in god i would gladly know about that please explain it to me they think that because the soul or mind is immaterial it cant be united with material things so as to perceive them in themselves but that it perceives them through its union with the substance of god because that is a spiritual substance it is purely intelligible that is capable of being the immediate object of a human minds thought furthermore gods essence contains perfections corresponding to each created thing and this correspondence enables those perfections to represent created things to the human mind i dont understand how our ideas which are entirely passive and inert can be or be like any part of the essence of god who is indivisible never passive always active this hypothesis is open to many other obvious objections but i shall only add that in making a created world exist otherwise than in the mind of a spirit the hypothesis of malebranche is liable to all the absurdities of the more usual views added to which it has a special absurdity all its own namely that it makes the material world serve no purpose if it is valid to argue against other hypotheses in the sciences that they suppose nature or the divine wisdom to make something for no purpose or to employ tedious roundabout methods to get a result which could have been achieved much more easily and swiftly what are we to think of this hypothesis which supposes that the whole world was made for no purpose but dont you also hold that we see all things in god if im not mistaken your thesis comes near to that few men think but all insist on having opinions which is why mens opinions are superficial and confused it isnt surprising that doctrines which in themselves are ever so different should nevertheless be confused with one another by people who dont think hard about them so i shant be surprised if some men imagine that i run into the wild fantasies of malebranche though in truth i am very remote from them he builds on the most abstract general ideas which i entirely disclaim he asserts an absolute external world which i deny he maintains that we are deceived by our senses and dont know the real natures or the true forms and shapes of extended things of all which i hold the direct contrary so that overall there are no principles more fundamentally opposite than his and mine i have to say that i entirely agree with what the holy scripture says that in god we live and move and have our being but i am far from believing that we see things in his essence in the manner you have presented here is my view in a nutshell it is evident that the things i perceive are my own ideas and that no idea can exist except in a mind it is equally obvious that these ideas or things perceived by meor things of which they are copiesexist independently of my mind because i know that i am not their author it being out of my power to choose what particular ideas i shall experience when i open my eyes or ears so they must exist in some other mind who wills that they be exhibited to me the things i immediately perceive i repeat are ideas or sensations call them what you will but how can any idea or sensation exist in or be produced by anything other than a mind or spirit that really is inconceivable and to assert something that is inconceivable is to talk nonsense isnt it without doubt on the other side it is very conceivable that ideas or sensations should exist in and be produced by a spirit because this is just what i experience daily in myself when i perceive countless ideas and by an act of my will can form a great variety of them raising them up in my imagination though i have to say that these creatures of my imagination are not as distinct strong vivid and permanent as are the ones i perceive through my senses which latter are called real things from all this i conclude that there is a mind that affects me every moment with all the sensible impressions i perceive and from the variety order and manner of these impressions i conclude that the author of them is wise powerful and good beyond anything i can comprehend please get this straight i do not sayas malebranche doesthat i see things by perceiving something that represents them in the intelligible essence of god i dont even understand that what i say is this the things i perceive are known by the understanding and produced by the will of an infinite spirit isnt all this very plain and evident is there anything more in it than what a little observation of our own minds and what happens in them not only enables us to conceive but also obliges us to assent to i think i understand you very clearly and i admit that the proof you give of a deity is as convincing as it is surprising but granting that god is the supreme and universal cause of all things mightnt there be a third kind of thing besides spirits and ideas may we not admit a subordinate and limited cause of our ideas in a word may there not for all that be matter how often must i teach you the same thing you agree that the things immediately perceived by sense exist nowhere outside the mind but everything that is perceived by sense is perceived immediately therefore there is nothing sensible or perceivable that exists outside the mind so the matter that you still insist on is presumably meant to be something intelligiblesomething that can be discovered by reason and not by the senses you are in the right pray let me know what reasoning your belief in matter is based on and what this matter is in your present sense of the word i find myself affected with various ideas which i know i havent caused and they couldnt cause themselves or cause one another nor could they exist on their own because they are wholly inactive transient dependent beings so they have some cause other than me and other than themselves all i claim to know about this is that it is the cause of my ideas and this thing whatever it is i call matter tell me hylas is everyone free to change the current proper meaning of a common word in any language for example suppose a traveller told you that in a certain country men can pass unhurt through the fire and when he explained himself you found that he meant by fire what others call water or suppose he said that there are trees that walk on two legs meaning men by the term trees would you think this reasonable no i should think it very absurd common custom is the standard of correctness in language and deliberately to speak improperly is to pervert the use of speech and cant achieve anything except to prolong and multiply disputes when there is no real difference of opinion and doesnt matter in the common current meaning of the word signify an extended solid movable unthinking inactive substance it does and hasnt it been made evident that no such substance can possibly exist and even if it did exist how can something inactive be a cause and how can something unthinking be a cause of thought you are free to give the word matter a meaning that is contrary to its ordinary one and to tell me that you understand by matter an unextended thinking active being which is the cause of our ideas but this is just playing with words committing the very fault that you have just now rightly condemned i dont find fault with your reasoning in that you infer a cause from the phenomena but i deny that the cause that reason allows you to infer can properly be called matter there is indeed something in what you say but i am afraid you dont properly grasp what i mean i wouldnt want you to take me to be denying that god or an infinite spirit is the supreme cause of all things all i am arguing is that subordinate to the supreme agent or cause there is a cause of a limited and lower kind which concurs in goes along with the production of our ideas not by the action proper to spirits namely acts of will but by the action proper to matter namely motion you keep relapsing into your old exploded notion of a movable and consequently extended substance existing outside the mind what have you already forgotten what you were convinced of do you want me to repeat everything i have said about this really this isnt arguing fairly still to assume the existence of something that you have so often admitted not to exist but letting that go i ask arent all your ideas perfectly passive and inert including no kind of action in them they are and are sensible qualities anything else but ideas how often have i agreed that they are not but isnt motion a sensible quality it is consequently it is no action i agree with you and indeed it is obvious that when i move my finger it remains passive but my will that produced the motion is active now i want to know in the first place whether given that motion is not action you can conceive any action other than volition in the second place whether to say something and conceive nothing is not to talk nonsense and lastly whether having considered the premises you dont see that it is highly absurd and unreasonable to suppose that our ideas have any efficient or active cause other than spirit i give up the point entirely but although matter may not be a cause what blocks it from being an instrument subservient to the supreme agent in the production of our ideas an instrument you say please tell me about the shape springs wheels and motions of that instrument i dont claim to be able to do that because both this substance and its qualities are entirely unknown to me what so you think it is made up of unknown parts and has unknown motions and an unknown shape i dont think it has any shape or motion at all because you have convinced me that no sensible qualities can exist in an unperceiving substance but what notion can we possibly have of an instrument that has no sensible qualities not even extension i dont claim to have any notion of it and what reason do you have to think that this unknown and inconceivable something does exist is it that you think god cannot act as well without it or that you find by experience that some such thing is at work when you form ideas in your own mind you are always nagging me for reasons for what i believe what reasons do you have for not believing it for me seeing no reason for believing something is a sufficient reason for not believing it but setting aside reasons for believing you will not so much as let me know what it is you want me to believe since you say you have no sort of notion of it i beg you to consider whether it is like a philosopher or even like a man of common sense to claim to believe you know not what and you know not why hold on philonous when i tell you that matter is an instrument i dont mean absolutely nothing admittedly i dont know what the particular kind of instrument it is but still i have some notion of instrument in general which i apply to it but what if it should turn out that even the most general notion of instrument understood as meaning something distinct from cause contains something that makes the use of an instrument inconsistent with the divine attributes show me that and i shall give up the point i shall now do so what do you mean by the general nature or notion of instrument the general notion is made up of what is common to all particular instruments dont all instruments have this in common they are used only in doing things that cant be performed by the mere act of our wills thus for instance i never use an instrument to move my finger because it is done by a volition but i would use an instrument if i wanted to remove part of a rock or tear up a tree by the roots do you agree with this or can you show any example where an instrument is used in producing an effect which immediately depends on the will of the agent i admit that i cant well then how can you suppose that an allperfect spirit on whose will all things absolutely and immediately depend would need an instrument in his operations or that he would use one if he didnt need it thus it seems to me you have to admit that it would be incompatible with the infinite perfection of god for him to use a lifeless inactive instrument such as matter is supposed to be that is your own statements oblige you to give up the point no answer to that comes readily to mind there is an answer that should come to your mind you should be ready to admit to the truth when it has been fairly proved to you i shall state the proof again we beings whose powers are finite are forced to make use of instruments and the use of an instrument shows that the agent is limited by rules that were prescribed by someone else and not by him and that he cannot get what he wants except in suchandsuch a way and in suchandsuch conditions this seems clearly to imply that the supreme unlimited agent uses no tool or instrument at all an omnipotent spirit has only to will that something happen and it happens straight off without the use of any means when means are employed by inferior agents like you and me it isnt because of any real causal power that is in them any necessary fitness to produce the desired effect rather it is to comply with the laws of nature or those conditions prescribed to us by god the first cause who is himself above all limitation or prescription whatsoever i will no longer maintain that matter is an instrument but dont take me to be giving up on its existence because despite everything you have said it may still be an occasion how many shapes is your matter to take how often must it be proved not to exist before you are content to let it go by all the laws of debate i am entitled to blame you for so frequently changing the meaning of the principal term matter but i shant press that point instead i ask you this having already denied matter to be a cause what do you mean when you affirm that it is an occasion and when you have shown what you mean by occasion then please show me what reason leads you to believe there is such an occasion of our ideas as to the first point by occasion i mean an inactive unthinking being at the presence of which god causes ideas in our minds and what may be the nature of that inactive unthinking being i know nothing of its nature proceed then to the second point and give me some reason why we should believe in the existence of this inactive unthinking unknown thing when we see ideas produced in our minds in an orderly and constant manner it is natural to think they have some fixed and regular occasions at the presence of which they are excited you acknowledge then that god alone is the cause of our ideas and that he causes them in the presence of those occasions that is what i think no doubt god perceives the things that you say are present to him certainly otherwise they couldnt provide him with occasions of acting without insisting now on your making sense of this hypothesis or on your answering all the puzzling questions and difficulties that beset it i merely ask isnt the order and regularity found in the series of our ideasthat is the course of naturesufficiently explained by the wisdom and power of god doesnt it take away from gods wisdom and power to suppose that any unthinking substance influences or directs him concerning what to do and when to do it even if i granted you all that you contend for regarding matter as gods occasion for acting would you get the result you want the point of the last question is that its hard to see how the external or absolute existence of an unthinking substance distinct from its being perceived can be inferred from there being certain things perceived by the mind of god which are to him the occasion of producing ideas in us i am utterly at a loss about what to think this notion of occasion now seems to be just as groundless as the rest dont you at last see that in all these different senses of matter you have only been supposing you know not what for no reason and to no purpose i freely admit to having become less fond of my notions since you have examined them in such precise detail but still i think i have some confused perception that there is such a thing as matter either you perceive the existence of matter immediately or you perceive it mediately if immediately please tell me by which of the senses you perceive it if mediately let me know what reasoning you employ to infer it from things that you do perceive immediately so much for the perception then for the matter itself i ask whether it is object substratum cause instrument or occasion you have already argued for each of these shifting your notions and making matter appear first in one guise and then in another and each thing you have offered has been disapproved and rejected by yourself if you have anything new to advance i would gladly hear it i think i have already offered all i had to say on those topics i am at a loss what more to urge and yet youre reluctant to part with your old prejudice but to make it easier for you to drop it i ask you to consideras well as all my other pointsthe question of how you could possibly be affected by matter if it did exist and the question of whether it would make any difference to the ideas you experienceand thus make any difference to your reasons to believe in its existenceif matter didnt exist i agree that it is possible we might perceive all things just as we do now without there being any matter in the world and in answer to your first question i cant conceive how matterif there is such a thingcould produce any idea in our minds and i also admit that you have entirely satisfied me that it is impossible for there to be such a thing as matter in any of the previous senses of the term but still i cant help supposing that there is matter in some sense or other i dont claim to settle what sense that is i dont demand that you define exactly the nature of that unknown being just tell me whether it is a substance and if it is whether you can suppose a substance without qualities and if on the other hand you suppose it to have qualities please tell me what those qualities are or at least what it means to say that matter supports them we have already argued on those points i have no more to say about them but to head off any further questions let me tell you that i now understand by matter neither substance nor accident thinking nor extended being neither cause instrument nor occasion but something entirely unknown different from all those it seems then that you include in your present notion of matter nothing but the general abstract of idea of entity or thing nothing else except that i add to this general idea of thing the negation of all those particular things qualities or ideas that i perceive imagine or in any way apprehend where please do you suppose that this unknown matter exists oh philonous now you think you have entangled me for if i say it exists in some place you will infer that it exists in the mind since we agree that place or extension exists only in the mind but i am not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know where it exists but i am sure it doesnt exist in a place there is a negative answer for you and such answers are all you can expect to get for all your remaining questions about matter since you wont tell me where it exists please inform me about how you suppose it to exist or what you mean by saying that it exists it neither thinks nor acts neither perceives nor is perceived but what positive content is there in your abstracted notion of its existence when i look into it carefully i dont find that i have any positive notion or meaning at all i tell you again i am not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know what is meant by its existence or how it exists keep up this frankness good hylas and tell me sincerely whether you can form a distinct idea of entity in general abstracting from and excluding all thinking and corporeal beings all particular things whatsoever hold on let me think a littlei confess philonous i dont find that i can at first glance i thought i had some dilute and airy notion of pure entity in abstract but when i focussed on it it vanished the more i think about it the more am i confirmed in my wise decision to give only negative answers to your questions and not to claim the slightest positive knowledge or conception of matter its where its how its entity or anything about it so when you speak of the existence of matter you have no notion in your mind none at all here is where i think we have got to please tell me if i am wrong you attributed existence outside the mind first to the immediate objects of our perceptions this came from your belief in material substance then to their archetypesthe things of which they are copies then to their causes then to instruments then to occasions and lastly to something in general which on examination turns out to be nothing so matter comes to nothing what do you think hylas isnt this a fair summary of your whole proceeding be that as it may yet i still insist that our not being able to conceive a thing is no argument against its existence i freely grant that the existence of a thing that is not immediately perceived may reasonably be inferred from a cause effect operation sign or other circumstance and that it would be absurd for any man to argue against the existence of that thing from his having no direct and positive notion of it but where there is nothing of all this where neither reason nor revelation induces us to believe in the existence of a thing we dont have even a relative notion of it what is offered is so abstract that it rises above the distinction between perceiving and being perceived between spirit and idea and lastly not even the most inadequate or faint idea of it is claimed to exist where all this is the case i shant indeed draw any conclusion against the reality of any notion or against the existence of anything but i shall infer that you mean nothing at all that you are using words to no purpose without any design or meaning whatsoever and i leave it to you to consider how such mere jargon should be treated to be frank philonous your arguments seem in themselves unanswerable but their effect on me has not been enough to produce that total conviction that wholehearted agreement that comes with demonstration rigorous knockdown proof i find myself still relapsing into an obscure surmise of somethingorother that i call matter but dont you realize hylas that two things must cooperate to take away all doubts and produce a complete mental assent however clear the light is in which a visible object is set it wont be distinctly seen if there is any imperfection in the vision or if the eye is not directed towards it and however solid and clearly presented a demonstration is yet if there is also prejudice or wrong bias in the understanding can it be expected all at once to see the truth clearly and adhere to it firmly no for that to happen time and effort are needed the attention must be awakened and held by frequent repetition of the same thingoften in the same light often in different lights i have said it already and find i must still repeat it to get you to accept it when you claim to accept you dont know what for you dont know what reason and for you dont know what purpose you are taking extraordinary liberties can this be parallelled in any art or science any sect or profession of men or is there anything so shamelessly groundless and unreasonable to be met with even in the lowest of common conversation but you persist in saying matter may exist without knowing what you mean by matter or what you mean by saying that it exists what makes this especially surprising is the fact that its something you have just decided to say you arent led to it by any reasons at all for i challenge you to show me something in nature that needs matter to explain or account for it the reality of things cant be maintained without supposing the existence of matter dont you think this is a good reason why i should be earnest in its defence the reality of things what things sensible or intelligible sensible things my glove for example that or any other thing perceived by the senses let us fix on one particular thing isnt it a sufficient evidence to me of the existence of this glove that i see it and feel it and wear it and if it isnt how could i be assured of the reality of this thing which i actually see in this place by supposing that some unknown thing which i never did or can see exists in an unknown manner in an unknown place or in no place at all how can the supposed reality of something intangible be a proof that anything tangible really exists or of something invisible that any visible thing really exists put generally how can the supposed reality of something imperceptible be a proof of the existence of a perceptible thing explain this and i shall think that nothing is too hard for you overall i am content to admit that the existence of matter is highly improbable but i dont see that it is directly and absolutely impossible even if matter is granted to be possible that doesnt give it a claim to existence any more than a golden mountain or a centaur which are also possible i admit that but still you dont deny that it is possible and something that is possible may for all you know actually exist i do deny it to be possible and i think i have proved that it isnt from premises that you have conceded in the ordinary sense of the word matter is anything more implied than an extended solid shaped movable substance existing outside the mind and havent you admitted over and over that youve seen evident reason for denying the possibility of such a substance true but that is only one sense of the term matter but isnt it the only proper genuine commonly accepted sense and if matter in such a sense is proved impossible may it not be thought with good grounds to be absolutely impossible otherwise how could anything be proved impossible indeed how could there be any proof at all of anything to a man who feels free to unsettle and change the common meanings of words i thought philosophers might be allowed to speak more accurately than common people do and were not always confined to the common meaning of a term but the meaning i have stated is the common accepted sense among philosophers anyway setting that point aside havent i let you take matter in whatever sense you pleased and havent you used this privilege to the utmost extent sometimes entirely changing the meaning at others leaving out or putting into the definition of matter whatever at that moment best served your purposes contrary to all the known rules of reason and logic and hasnt this shifting unfair method of yours spun out our dispute to an unnecessary length matter having been scrutinised in each particular one of those senses and by your own admission refuted in each of them and can any more be required to prove the absolute impossibility of a thing than to prove it to be impossible in every particular sense that you or anyone else understands it in i am not so thoroughly satisfied that you have proved the impossibility of matter in the last most obscure abstracted and indefinite sense when is a thing shown to be impossible when an inconsistency is demonstrated between the ideas contained in its definition but where there are no ideas no contradiction between ideas can be demonstrated i agree with you now consider the sense of the word matter that you have just called obscure and indefinite by your own admission it is obvious that this includes no idea at all no senseexcept an unknown sense which is the same thing as none so you cant expect me to prove an inconsistency between ideas where there are no ideas or to prove the impossibility of matter taken in an unknown sense that is in no sense at all i aimed only to show that you meant nothing and i got you to admit that so that in all your various senses you have been shown to mean nothing at all or if something then an absurdity if this isnt sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing i wish you would tell me what is i admit that you have proved that matter is impossible nor do i see what else can be said in defence of it but when i give up matter i come to suspect all my other notions for surely none could be more seemingly evident than this once was yet it now seems as false and absurd as it previously seemed true but i think we have discussed the point enough for the present i would like to spend the rest of today running over in my thoughts the various parts of this mornings conversation and ill be glad to meet you again here tomorrow at about the same time ill be here the third dialogue philonous tell me hylas what has come of yesterdays meditation has it confirmed you in the views you held when we parted or has it given you cause to change your opinion hylas truly my opinion is that all our opinions are equally useless and uncertain what we approve today we condemn tomorrow we make a fuss about knowledge and spend our lives in the pursuit of it yet all the time alas we know nothing and i dont think we can ever know anything in this life our faculties are too narrow and too few nature certainly never intended us for speculation for the pursuit of true theories what you say we can know nothing hylas there isnt one single thing in the world whose real nature we can know are you going to tell me that i dont really know what fire or water is you may indeed know that fire appears hot and water fluid but that is merely knowing what sensations are produced in your own mind when fire or water is applied to your senseorgans you are utterly in the dark as to their internal constitution their true and real nature dont i know that this is a real stone that im standing on and that what i see before my eyes is a real tree know no it is impossible that you or any man alive should know it all you know is that you have such and such an idea or appearance in your own mind but what does that have to do with the real tree or stone i tell you the colour shape and hardness that you perceive arent the real natures of those things or in the least like them the same may be said of all other real things or corporeal substances that make up the world none of them has in itself anything like the sensible qualities that we perceive so we shouldnt claim to affirm or know anything about them as they are in their own nature but surely hylas i can distinguish gold for example from iron how could i do that if i didnt know what either truly was believe me philonous you can only distinguish between your own ideas that yellowness that weight and other sensible qualitiesdo you think that they are really in the gold they are only relations to the senses and have no absolute existence in nature and in claiming to distinguish the species of real things on the basis of the appearances in your mind you may be acting as foolishly as someone who inferred that two men were of a different species because their clothes were of different colours it seems then that we are fobbed off with the appearances of things and false appearances at that the food i eat and the clothes i wear have nothing in them that is like what i see and feel just so but isnt it strange that everyone should be thus deceived and be so foolish as to believe their senses and yet men i dont know how eat and drink and sleep and get on with their lives as comfortably and conveniently as if they really knew the things they have to deal with they do so but you know ordinary practical affairs dont require precise theoretical knowledge so the common people can retain their mistakes and yet manage to bustle through the affairs of life but philosophers know better things you mean they know that they know nothing that is the very peak and perfection of human knowledge but are you serious about all this hylas are you really convinced that you know nothing real in the world if you were going to write wouldnt you call for pen ink and paper like anyone else and wouldnt you know what it was you were calling for how often must i tell you that i dont know the real nature of any single thing in the universe it is true that i sometimes use pen ink and paper but i declare positively that i dont know what any of them is in its own true nature and the same is true with regard to every other corporeal thing furthermore we are ignorant not only of the true and real nature of things but even of their existence it cant be denied that we perceive certain appearances or ideas but it cant be concluded from this that bodies really exist indeed now that i think about it my former concessions oblige me to declare that it is impossible that any real corporeal thing should exist in nature you amaze me was ever anything more wild and extravagant than the notions you now maintain isnt it evident that you are led into all these extravagances by the belief in material substance thats what makes you dream of those unknown natures in every thing it is what leads you to distinguish the reality of things from their sensible appearances it is to this that you are indebted for being ignorant of what everyone else knows perfectly well nor is this all you are ignorant not only of the true nature of every thing but of whether any thing really exists or whether there are any true natures at all because you attribute to your material beings an absolute or external existence and suppose that their reality consists in that as you are eventually forced to admit that such an existence means either a direct contradiction or nothing at all it follows that you are obliged to pull down your own hypothesis of material substance and positively to deny the real existence of any part of the universe and so you are plunged into the deepest and most deplorable scepticism that anyone ever suffered from tell me hylas isnt that what has happened yes it is material substance was no more than an hypothesis and a false and groundless one too i will no longer waste my breath defending it but whatever hypothesis you advance whatever system you introduce in place of it i am sure it will appear every bit as false if you allow me to question you about it allow me to treat you as you have me and ill lead you through as many perplexities and contradictions to the very same state of scepticism that i myself am in at present i assure you hylas i dont claim to formulate any hypothesis at all i have the common mans frame of mind i am simple enough to believe my senses and to leave things as i find them heres what i think in plain words the real things are the very things i see and feel and perceive by my senses i know these and because i find that they satisfy all the needs and purposes of life i have no reason to worry about any other unknown beings a piece of sensible perceptible bread for instance would appease my hunger better than ten thousand times as much of that insensible unintelligible real bread you speak of it is also my opinion that colours and other sensible qualities are in the objects i cant for the life of me help thinking that snow is white and fire hot you indeed who by snow and fire mean certain external unperceived unperceiving substances are right to deny whiteness or heat to be qualities inherent in them but i who understand by snow and fire the things i see and feel am obliged to think as other folk do and as i am no sceptic about the nature of things i am not a sceptic either about their existence that a thing should be really perceived by my senses and at the same time not really exist is to me a plain contradiction since i cannot abstract even in thought the existence of a sensible thing from its being perceived wood stones fire water flesh iron and other such things that i name and talk about are things that i know and i wouldnt have known them if i hadnt perceived them by my senses and things perceived by the senses are immediately perceived and things that are immediately perceived are ideas and ideas cant exist outside the mind so it follows that the existence of things i perceive by my senses consists in being perceived when they are actually perceived therefore there can be no doubt about their existence away then with all that scepticism all those ridiculous philosophical doubts what a joke is it for a philosopher to question the existence of sensible things until it is proved to him from the truthfulness of god or to claim that our knowledge about this falls short of the knowledge we have of things that are obviously selfevident or rigorously proved i might as well doubt my own existence as the existence of the things that i actually see and feel not so fast philonous you say that you cant conceive how sensible things should exist outside the minddont you i do supposing you were annihilated cant you conceive it to be possible that things perceivable by sense might still exist i can but then it must be in another mind when i say that sensible things cant exist out of the mind i dont mean my mind in particular but all minds now they clearly have an existence exterior to my mind since i find by experience that they are independent of it there is therefore some other mind in which they exist during the intervals between the times when i perceive them as likewise they did before my birth and would do after my supposed annihilation and as the same is true with regard to all other finite created minds it necessarily follows that there is an omnipresent eternal mind which knows and comprehends all things and lets us experience them in a certain manner according to rules that he himself has ordained and that we call the laws of nature although comprehends can mean understands here it probably means includesall things are known by and are in the mind of god tell me philonous are all our ideas perfectly inert beings or have they any agency included in them they are altogether passive and inert and isnt god an agent a being purely active i agree so an idea cannot be like god or represent his nature it cannot if you have no idea of the mind of god how can you conceive it to be possible that things exist in his mind that is if you have no idea of his mind how can you have any thought about his mind on the other hand if you can have a thought about the mind of god without having an idea of him then why cant i conceive the existence of matter without having an idea of it i acknowledge that strictly speaking i have no idea either of god or any other spirit for these being active cant be represented by things that are perfectly inert as our ideas are still even though i have no idea of myself because i am a spirit or thinking substance i know that i exist i know this indeed as certainly as i know that my ideas exist i also know what i mean by the terms i and myself and i know this immediately or intuitively though i dont perceive it as i perceive a triangle a colour or a sound the mind spirit soul is the indivisible and unextended thing that thinks acts and perceives it is indivisible because it is unextended and it is unextended because the only extended shaped movable things are ideas and something that perceives ideas and that thinks and wills clearly cant itself be an idea ideas are inactive things that are perceived and spirits are things of a totally different sort so i deny that my soul is an idea or like an idea however my soul can be said to furnish me with an idea of god in a broad sense of the word ideathat is an image or likeness of god though indeed an extremely inadequate one i get my notion of god by reflecting on my own soul heightening its powers and removing its imperfections my basic thought of god therefore is the thought of a thing that is like me except and so on so although i have no inert idea of god in my mind i do have in myself a kind of active image of him because i myself am an image likeness of him and though i dont perceive him by sense still i have a notion of him which is to say that i know him by reflection and reasoning i immediately know my own mind and my own ideas and these give me in an indirect way a grasp of the possibility that other spirits and ideas exist further from the fact that i exist and the fact that i find that my ideas of sense arent caused by me i reason my way to the unavoidable conclusion that a god exists and that all created things exist in his mind so much for your first question by this time you can probably answer your second question for yourself i have shown that there are four different ways in which things can come before the mind and none of them is a way in which matter could come before your mind i you dont perceive matter by mentally representing it as you do an inactive being or idea ii nor do you know it as you know yourself by an act of mentally attending to yourself iii you dont understand it indirectly through a resemblance between it and either your ideas or yourself and iv you dont bring it into your mind by reasoning from what you know immediately all of this makes the case of matter widely different from that of god because your knowledge of him involves iii and iv you say that your own soul supplies you with a kind of idea or image of god but you admit that strictly speaking you have no idea of your soul you even assert that spirits are utterly different in kind from ideas which means that no idea can be like a spirit which implies that there can be no idea of a spirit so you have no idea of spiritual substance yet you insist that spiritual substance exists on the other hand from your having no idea or notion of material substance you infer that material substance doesnt exist is that fair to be consistent you should either admit matter or reject spirit what do you say to this my answer falls into three parts i dont deny the existence of material substance merely because i have no notion of it but because the notion of it is inconsistentto have a notion of it would involve a selfcontradiction for all i know to the contrary there may exist many things of which none of us has or can have any idea or notion whatsoever but such things must be possible ie nothing inconsistent must be included in their definition although we believe in the existence of some things that we dont perceive we oughtnt to believe that any particular thing exists without some reason for thinking so but i have no reason for believing in the existence of matter i have no immediate intuition of it and i cant infer itrigorously or even by probable inferencefrom my sensations ideas notions actions or passions in contrast with this i undeniably know by reflection the existence of myself that is my own soul mind or source of thought you will forgive me if i repeat the same things in answer to the same objections the notion or definition of material substance includes an obvious inconsistency and that is not so for the notion of spirit that ideas should exist in something that doesnt perceive or be produced by something that doesnt act is inconsistent but there is no inconsistency in saying that a perceiving thing is the subject of ideas or that an active thing causes them i concede that the existence of other finite spirits is not immediately evident to us nor have we any way of rigorously proving it but that doesnt put such spirits on a level with material substances because there are the following three differences it is inconsistent to suppose there is matter but not to suppose there are finite spirits there is no argument for matter while there are probable reasons in favour of spirits there are no signs or symptoms that make it reasonable to believe in matter but we see signs and effects indicating that there are other finite agents like ourselves although i dont have an idea of spirit if idea is used strictly i do have a notion of it i dont perceive it as an idea or by means of an idea but i know it by reflection on myself despite all that you have said it seems to me that according to your own way of thinking and by your own principles you should conclude that you are only a system of floating ideas without any substance to support them words shouldnt be used without a meaning and as there is no more meaning in spiritual substance than in material substance the former is to be exploded as well as the latter how often must i repeat it i know or am conscious of my own existence and i know that i myself am not my ideas but something elsea thinking active principle here force or source of energy which perceives knows wills and operates on ideas i know that i one and the same self perceive both colours and sounds that a colour cannot perceive a sound nor a sound a colour and therefore that i am one individual thing distinct from colour and sound and for the same reason distinct from all other sensible things and inert ideas but i am not in the same way conscious of either the existence or the essence of matter on the contrary i know that nothing inconsistent can exist and that the existence of matter implies an inconsistency furthermore i know what i mean when i assert that there is a spiritual substance or support of ideas that is that a spirit knows and perceives ideas but i dont know what people mean when they say that an unperceiving substance contains and supports either ideas or items of which ideas are copies so there is no significant likeness between spirit and matter i admit to being satisfied about this but do you seriously think that the real existence of sensible things consists in their being actually perceived if so how does it come about that all mankind distinguish between them ask the first man you meet and hell tell you that to be perceived is one thing and to exist is another i am content hylas to appeal to the common sense of the world for the truth of my view ask the gardener why he thinks that cherry tree over there exists in the garden and he will tell you because he sees and feels itin short because he perceives it by his senses ask him why he thinks there is no orangetree there and he will tell you because he doesnt perceive one when he perceives something by sense he terms it a real thing and says that it exists and anything that isnt perceivable he says doesnt exist yes philonous i agree that the existence of a sensible thing consists in being perceivable but not in being actually perceived and what is perceivable but an idea and can an idea exist without being actually perceived these are points long since agreed between us however true your view is you must admit that it is shocking and contrary to the common sense of men ask your gardener whether that tree has an existence out of his mind what answer do you think he would give you the same answer that i would give namely that it does exist out of his mind but then surely to a christian it cant be shocking to say that the real tree existing outside his mind is truly known and comprehended by that is exists in the infinite mind of god probably the gardener wont at first glance be aware of the direct and immediate proof there is of thisnamely that the very existence of a tree or any other perceptible thing implies a mind that contains it but the point itself is one that he cant deny what is at issue between the materialists and me is not whether things have a real existence outside the mind of this or that person but whether they exist outside all minds having an existence that doesnt involve being perceived by god some heathens and philosophers have indeed affirmed this but anyone whose notions of god are appropriate to the holy scriptures will think differently but how according to your views do real things differ from chimeras formed by the imagination or the visions of a dream since according to you they are all equally in the mind the ideas formed by the imagination are faint and indistinct also they are entirely dependent on the will but the ideas perceived by sensethat is real thingsare more vivid and clear and they dont in that way depend on our will because they are imprinted on our mind by a spirit other than us so theres no danger of mixing up these real things with the foregoing ideas formed by the imagination and equally little danger of failing to distinguish them from the visions of a dream which are dim irregular and confused and even if dreams were very lively and natural they could easily be distinguished from realities by their not being coherently connected with the preceding and subsequent episodes of our lives in short whatever method you use to distinguish things from chimeras is obviously available to me too for any such method must i presume be based on some perceived difference and i dont want to deprive you of any one thing that you perceive but still philonous you hold that there is nothing in the world but spirits and ideas you must admit that this sounds very odd i agree that the word idea not being commonly used for thing sounds a little peculiar i used it because it implies a necessary relation to the mind and it is now commonly used by philosophers to stand for the immediate objects of the understanding but however odd the proposition may sound in words theres nothing very strange or shocking in what it means which in effect amounts merely to this that there are only perceiving things and perceived things or that every unthinking being is necessarilyfrom the very nature of its existenceperceived by some mind if not by any finite created mind then certainly by the infinite mind of god in whom we live and move and have our being is this as strange as to say that sensible qualities arent in the objects or that we cant be sure of the existence of things or know anything of their real natures although we see and feel them and perceive them by all our senses dont we have to infer from this that there are no such things as physical or corporeal causes but that a spirit is the immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature can there be anything more extravagant than this yes there can it is infinitely more extravagant to say that an inert thing operates on the mind and an unperceiving thing causes our perceptions anyway the view that you for some reason find so extravagant is no more than the holy scriptures assert in a hundred places in them god is represented as the sole and immediate cause of all those effects that some heathens and philosophers customarily attribute to nature matter fate or some such unthinking agent there is no need for me to support this with particular citationsscripture is full of it you arent aware philonous that in making god the immediate cause of all the motions in nature you make him the author of murder sacrilege adultery and the like heinous sins in answer to that i remark first that a persons guilt is the same whether he performs an action with or without an instrument so if you think that god acts through the mediation of an instrument or occasion called matter you make him the author of sin just as much as i do through my view that he is immediate agent in all those operations that common people ascribe to nature i further remark that sin or wickedness does not consist in the outward physical action or movement but in something internalthe wills departing from the laws of reason and religion this is clearly so from the fact that killing an enemy in a battle or putting a criminal legally to death is not thought sinful although the outward acts are exactly the same as in murder sin therefore doesnt consist in the physical action so making god an immediate cause of all such actions isnt making him the author of sin lastly i have nowhere said that god is the only agent who produces all the motions in bodies true i have denied there are any agents other than spirits but this is quite consistent with assigning to thinking rational beings the use of limited powers in the production of motions these powers are indeed ultimately derived from god but they are immediately under the direction of the beings own wills and that is sufficient to entitle them to all the guilt of their actions but denying matter philonous or corporeal substance there is the sticking point you can never persuade me that this isnt in conflict with the universal sense of mankind if our dispute were to be settled by majority vote i am confident that you would surrender without counting the votes i would like both our positions to be fairly stated and submitted to the judgment of men who had plain common sense without the prejudices of a learned education let me be represented as one who trusts his senses who thinks he knows the things he sees and feels and has no doubts about their existence and you fairly present yourself armed with all your doubts your paradoxes and your scepticism and i shall willingly accept the decision of any unbiased person to me it is obvious that spirit is the only substance in which ideas can exist and everyone agrees that the objects we immediately perceive are ideas and noone can deny that sensible qualities are objects that we immediately perceive it is therefore evident there cant be any substratum of those qualities they can exist in a spirit not as qualities of it but as things perceived by it so i deny that there is any unthinking substratum of the objects of sense and that is the meaning of my denial that there is any material substance but if by material substance is meant only sensible body that which is seen and felt and i dare say that unphilosophical people mean no more then i am more certain of matters existence than you or any other philosopher claim to be if there is anything that turns people in general off from the views that i support it is the mistaken idea that i deny the reality of sensible things but it is you who are guilty of that not i so what they are really hostile to are your notions not mine i do therefore assertas something i am as certain of as i am of my own existencethat there are bodies or corporeal substances meaning the things i perceive by my senses most people will agree with this and will neither think nor care about the fate of those unknown natures and essences that some men are so fond of what do you say to this since according to you men judge the reality of things by their senses how can a man be mistaken in thinking that the moon is a plain shining surface about a foot in diameter or that a square tower seen at a distance is round or that an oar with one end in the water is crooked he is mistaken not with regard to the ideas he actually perceives but in what he infers from his present perceptions thus in the case of the oar what he immediately perceives by sight is certainly crooked and to that extent he is right but if he infers from this that when he takes the oar out of the water he will see the same crookedness or that it will affect his sense of touch as crooked things usually do in that he is mistaken likewise if from what he perceives in one place he infers that if he moves closer to the moon or tower he will still experience similar ideas he is mistaken but his mistake lies not in what he perceives immediately and at present for it is a manifest contradiction to suppose he could err about that but in the wrong judgment he makes concerning the ideas he thinks to be connected with the ones he immediately perceives or concerning the ideas thatjudging by what he perceives at presenthe thinks would be perceived in other circumstances the case is the same with regard to the copernican system we dont perceive any motion of the earth while we are standing on it but it would be wrong to infer from this that if we were placed at as great a distance from earth as we are now from the other planets we would not then perceive the earths motion i understand you and i have to admit that what you say is plausible enough still let me remind you of something tell me philonous werent you formerly as sure that matter exists as you are now that it does not i was but here lies the difference before my confidence was uncritically based on prejudice but my confidence now after enquiry rests on evidence after all it seems that our dispute is about words rather than things we agree in the thing but differ in the name it is obvious that we are affected with ideas from outside ourselves and it is equally obvious that there must be powers outside the mind corresponding to those ideas i dont say resembling them and as these powers cant exist by themselves we have to postulate some subject of themsome thing that has the powerswhich i call matter and you call spirit this is all the difference hylas is that powerful being or subject of powers extended it isnt but it has the power to cause the idea of extension in you in itself therefore it is unextended i grant it is it not also active without doubt otherwise how could we attribute powers to it now let me ask you two questions first does it conform to the usage of philosophers or of nonphilosophers to give the name matter to an unextended active being second isnt it ridiculously absurd to misapply names contrary to the common use of language well then let it not be called matter since you insist but some third nature distinct from matter and spirit for what reason do you have to call it spirit doesnt the notion of spirit imply that it is thinking as well as active and unextended my reason is as follows i want to have some notion or meaning in what i say but i have no notion of any action other than volition and i cant conceive of volition as being anywhere but in a spirit so when i speak of an active being i am obliged to mean a spirit besides it is quite obvious that a thing that can impart ideas to me must have ideas in itself and if a thing has ideas surely it must be a spirit i shall state the case differently to enable you to understand the point still more clearly if that is possible i assert as you do that since we are affected from outside ourselves we must accept that there are powers outside us in some being that is distinct from ourselves up to here we are in agreement but then we differ about what kind of powerful being it is i say it is spirit you say that it is matter or else some third kind of thingi dont know of what kind and nor do you here is how i prove it to be spirit from the effects i see produced i infer that there are actions so there are volitions so there must be a will again the things i perceive or things they are copied from must exist outside my mind but because they are ideas neither they nor things they are copied from can exist otherwise than in an understanding there is therefore an understanding but will and understanding constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit the powerful cause of my ideas is therefore something that it is strictly proper to call a spirit i suppose you think you have made the point very clear little suspecting that what you propose leads directly to a contradiction it is an absurdity to imagine any imperfection in god is it not without doubt to suffer pain is an imperfection it is are we not sometimes affected with pain and discomfort by some being other than ourselves we are and havent you said that that being is a spirit and is not that spirit god i agree but you have asserted that any ideas that we perceive from outside ourselves are in the mind that affects us it follows that the ideas of pain and discomfort are in god or in other words god suffers pain that is to say that there is an imperfection in the divine nature which you agreed was absurd so you are caught in a plain contradiction i dont question that god knows or understands all things including knowing what pain is he even knows every sort of painful sensation and what it is for his creatures to suffer pain but i positively deny that god though he knows and sometimes causes painful sensations in us can himself suffer pain we who are limited and dependent spirits are liable to sensory impressionscaused by an external agent and produced against our willsthat are sometimes painful and distressing but god cannot suffer anything or be affected with any painful sensation or indeed with any sensation at all because no external being can affect him he perceives nothing by sense as we do his will is absolute and independent causing all things and incapable of being thwarted or resisted by anything we are chained to a body that is to say our perceptions are connected with bodily motions by the law of our nature we undergo changes in our minds with every alteration in the nervous parts of our sensible perceptible body this sensible body is really nothing but a complex of qualities or ideas that have no existence other than through being perceived by a mind so that this connection of sensations with bodily motions comes down to a mere correspondence in the order of nature between two sets of ideas or immediately perceivable thingsthe set of ideas perceived by someones mind and the set constituting his body in contrast with this god is a pure spirit disengaged from all such correspondences or linkages according to laws of nature no bodily motions are accompanied by sensations of pain or pleasure in his mind to know everything knowable is certainly a perfection but to endure or suffer or feel anything through the senses is an imperfection the former i repeat fits god but not the latter god knows or has ideas but his ideas arent conveyed to him by sense as ours are what led you to think you saw an absurdity where really there is none was your failure to attend to this obvious difference between god and his creatures there is a well established scientific result which implies the existence of matter and you have ignored it throughout all this you havent considered the fact that the quantity of matter has been demonstrated rigorously proved to be proportional to the gravity of bodies and what can stand up against the force of a demonstration let me see how you demonstrate that point i lay it down for a principle that the quantities of motion in bodies are directly proportional to their velocities and the quantities of matter contained in them when the velocities of two bodies are equal therefore their quantities of motion are directly proportional to the quantity of matter in each but it has been found by experience that all bodies not counting small inequalities arising from the resistance of the air fall with an equal velocity and so the motion of falling bodies and consequently their gravity which is the cause or source of that motion is proportional to the quantity of matter they contain which is what i was to demonstrate you lay it down as a selfevident principle that the quantity of motion in any body is proportional to the velocity and matter taken together and this is used to prove a proposition from which the existence of matter is inferred isnt this arguing in a circle in the premise i only mean that the motion is proportional to the velocity jointly with the extension and solidity so i dont need to use the term matter in the premise but even if this is true it doesnt imply that gravity is proportional to matter in your philosophical sense of the word to get that conclusion you have to take it for granted in your premise that your unknown substratum or whatever else you call it is proportional to those sensible qualities velocity and quantity of motion but to suppose that is plainly assuming what was to be proved i readily grant that there is size and solidity or resistance perceived by the senses and i shant dispute the claim that gravity is proportional to those qualities what i do deny is that these qualities as perceived by us or the powers producing them exist in a material substratum you affirm this but despite your demonstration you havent yet proved it i shant press that point any further do you expect though to persuade me that natural scientists have been dreaming all through the years what becomes of all their hypotheses and explanations of the phenomena which presuppose the existence of matter what do you mean by the phenomena i mean the appearances that i perceive by my senses and the appearances perceived by the sensesarent they ideas i have told you so a hundred times therefore to explain the phenomena is to show how we come to be affected with ideas in the particular manner and order in which they are imprinted on our senses is it not it is now if you can prove that any scientist has explained the production of any one idea in our minds with the help of matter i shall capitulate and regard all that i have said against matter as nothing but if you cant you will get nowhere by urging the explanation of phenomena it is easy to understand that a being endowed with knowledge and will should produce or display ideas but i can never understand how a being that is utterly destitute of knowledge and will could produce ideas or in any way to affect a mind even if we had some positive conception of matter knew its qualities and could comprehend its existence it would still be so far from explaining things that it would itself be the most inexplicable thing in the world from all this however it doesnt follow that scientists have been doing nothing for by observing and reasoning about connections of ideas they discover the laws and methods of nature which is a useful and interesting branch of knowledge all the same can it be supposed god would deceive all mankind do you imagine that he would have induced the whole world to believe in the existence of matter if there was no such thing i dont think you will affirm that every widespread opinion arising from prejudice or passion or thoughtlessness may be blamed on god as the author of it we arent entitled to lay at his door an opinion of ours unless either he has shown it to us by supernatural revelation or it is so evident to our natural faculties which were formed and given to us by god that we couldnt possibly withhold our assent from it but where is the supernatural revelation of matter or where is the evidence that compels us to believe in it indeed what is the evidence that matter taken for something distinct from what we perceive by our senses is thought to exist by all mankind or indeed by any except a few philosophers who dont know what they are saying your question presupposes that these points are clear when you have made them so i shall regard myself as obliged to give you another answer in the meantime let it suffice that i tell you that i dont suppose that god has deceived mankind at all but the novelty philonous the novelty there lies the danger new notions should always be discouraged they unsettle mens minds and nobody knows what they will lead to i cant imagine why rejecting a notion that has no basis in sense or in reason or in divine authority should be thought to unsettle mens hold on beliefs that are grounded on all or any of these i freely grant that new opinions about government and religion are dangerous and ought to be discountenanced but is there any such reason why they should be discouraged in philosophy making anything known that was unknown before introduces a new opinion and if all such new opinions had been forbidden what a notable progress men would have made in the arts and sciences but it isnt my concern to plead for novelties and paradoxes that the qualities we perceive are not in the objects that we mustnt believe our senses that we know nothing of the real nature of things and can never be assured even that they exist that real colours and sounds are nothing but certain unknown shapes and motions that motions are in themselves neither swift nor slow that bodies have absolute extensions without any particular size or shape that a stupid thoughtless and inactive thing operates on a spirit that the tiniest particle of a body contains countless extended parts these are the novelties these are the strange notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted judgment of all mankind and having once been accepted embarrass the mind with endless doubts and difficulties and it is against these and their like that i try to vindicate common sense it is true that in doing this i may have to express myself in some roundabout ways and to use uncommon turns of speech but once my notions are thoroughly understood what is strangest in them will be found to come down merely to this it is absolutely impossible and a plain contradiction to suppose that any unthinking being should exist without being perceived by a mind and if this view is found to be strange it is a shame that it should be so in our age and in a christian country i shant question what you say about the difficulties that other opinions may be liable to but it is your business to defend your own opinion can anything be more obvious than that you support changing all things into ideas yes you who are not ashamed to charge me with scepticism this is so obvious that there is no denying it you have me wrong what i support is not changing things into ideas but rather ideas into things since those immediate objects of perception which you say are only appearances of things are what i take to be the real things themselves things say what you like its certain that all you leave us with are the empty forms of things their mere outsides that strike the senses what you call the empty forms and outsides of things seem to me to be the things themselves and they arent empty or incomplete except on your supposition that matter is an essential part of all bodily things so you and i agree that we perceive only sensible forms but we differ in that you maintain them to be empty appearances while i think they are real beings in short you dont trust your senses i do trust mine you say that you believe your senses and you seem to congratulate yourself on agreeing with common people about this according to you therefore the true nature of a thing is discovered by the senses if so what is the source of the sensory disagreement that we experience why do different ways of perceivingeg sight and touchindicate different shapes for the same object and if the true nature of a body can be discovered by the naked eye why should a microscope enable us to know it better strictly speaking hylas we dont see the same object that we feel and the object perceived through the microscope isnt the same one that was perceived by the naked eye but if every variation were thought sufficient to constitute a new kind or new individual language would be made useless by the sheer number of names or by confusions amongst them therefore to avoid this and other inconveniences youll easily see what they are if you think about it men in their thought and language treat as one thing a number of ideas that are observed to have some connection in nature either occurring together or in sequence although the ideas are certainly distinct from one another because they are perceived through different senses or through one sense at different times or in different circumstances so when i see a thing and then proceed to examine it by my other senses im not trying to understand better the same object that i had seen that cant be what i am doing because the object of one sense cant be perceived by the other senses and when i look through a microscope it isnt so as to perceive more clearly what i had already perceived with my bare eyes because the objects perceived in these two ways are quite different from one another in each case all i want is to know what ideas are connected together and the more a man knows of the connection of ideas the more he is said to know of the nature of things if our ideas are variable and our senses are not always affected with the same appearanceswhat of it it doesnt follow that they arent to be trusted or that they are inconsistent either with themselves or with anything else except for your preconceived notion that each name stands for i know not what single unchanged unperceivable real nature a prejudice that seems to have arisen from a failure to understand the common language that people use when speaking of several distinct ideas as united into one thing by the mind there is reason to suspect that other erroneous views of the philosophers are due to the same source they founded their theories not so much on notions as on words which were invented by the common people merely for convenience and efficiency in the common actions of life without any regard to theories i think i follow you you hold that the ideas we perceive by our senses are not real things but images or copies of them so our knowledge is real only to the extent that our ideas are the true representations of those originals but as these supposed originals or real things are in themselves unknown we cant know how far our ideas resemble them or indeed whether they resemble them at all so we cant be sure that we have any real knowledge furthermore while the supposed real things remain unchanged our ideas keep changing so they cant all be true copies of the real things and if some are and others are not we cant tell which are which this plunges us yet deeper into uncertainty again when we think about it we cant conceive how any idea or anything like an idea could have an absolute existence out of any mind from which it follows according to your views that we cant conceive how there should be any real thing in nature because you say that real things are like ideas the result of all this is that we are hopelessly lost in scepticism now let me ask you four questions first doesnt all this scepticism arise from your relating ideas to certain absolutely existing unperceived substances as their originals secondly are you informed either by sense or reason of the existence of those unknown originals and if you are not isnt it absurd to suppose that they exist thirdly when you look into it do you find that there is anything distinctly conceived or meant by the absolute or external existence of unperceiving substances lastly having considered the premises that i have put to you isnt it wisest to follow nature trust your senses lay aside all anxious thoughts about unknown natures or substances and join the common people in taking the things that are perceived by the senses to be real things just now i am not inclined to answer your questions i would much rather see how you can answer mine arent the objects perceived by one persons senses also perceivable by others who are present if there were a hundred more people here they would all see the garden the trees and flowers as i see them but they dont experience in the same way the ideas that i form in my imagination doesnt this make a difference between the former sort of objects and the latter i agree that it does and i have never denied that the objects of sense are different from those of imagination but what would you infer from this you cant say that sensible objects exist unperceived because they are perceived by many people i admit that i cant make anything of that objection of mine but it has led me to another isnt it your opinion that all we perceive through our senses are the ideas existing in our minds it is but the idea that is in my mind cant be in yours or in any other mind so doesnt it follow from your principles that no two people can see the same thing and isnt this highly absurd if the term same be given its common meaning it is certain and not at all in conflict with the principles i maintain that different persons may perceive the same thing and that the same thing or idea can exist in different minds the meanings of words are assigned by us and since men customarily apply the word same where no distinction or variety is perceived and i dont claim to alter their perceptions it follows that as men have sometimes said several people saw the same thing they may continue to talk like that in similar situations without deviating either from correctness of language or the truth of things but if the term same is used in a meaning given to it by philosophers who claim to have an abstracted notion of identity then in that sense it may or may not be possible for different people to perceive the same thingdepending on their various definitions of this notion for it isnt yet agreed what that philosophical identity consists in but whether philosophers shall think fit to call a thing the same or not is of small importance i think let us suppose a group of men together all having the same faculties and consequently affected in similar ways by their senses but with no use of language there is no doubt that they would agree in their perceptions but when they came to the use of speech they might go different ways in their use of same some of them impressed by the uniformness of what was perceived might speak of the same thing while others struck by the diversity of the people whose perceptions were in question might speak of different things but cant anyone see that all the dispute is about a wordnamely a dispute over whether what is perceived by different people can have the term same applied to it or suppose a house whose outer walls remain unaltered while the rooms are all pulled down and new ones built in their place if you were to say that we still have the same house and i said it wasnt the same wouldnt we nevertheless perfectly agree in our thoughts about the house considered in itself wouldnt all the difference consist in a sound if you were to say that in that case we do differ in our notions because your idea of the house includes the simple abstracted idea of identity whereas mine does not i would tell you that i dont know what you mean by that abstracted idea of identity and i would invite you to look into your own thoughts and make sure that you understood yourselfwhy so silent hylas arent you satisfied yet that men can dispute about identity and nonidentity without any real difference in their thoughts and opinions apart from names take this further thought with you that this point still stands whether matter exists or not for the materialists themselves admit that what we immediately perceive by our senses are our own ideas so your difficultythat no two see the same thingholds as much against the materialists as against me but they suppose that an idea represents and copies an external thing and they can say truly that several people perceive the same thing meaning that their ideas all copy a single external thing you earlier gave up on those things that ideas were said to copy but let that pass anyway on my principles also you can suppose that ideas are copies of something external by which i mean external to ones own mind though indeed it must be supposed to exist in that mind which includes all things this thingthatiscopied serves all the ends of identityproviding a basis for saying they perceived the same thingas well as if it existed out of a mind and i am sure you wont say that it is less intelligible than the other you have indeed clearly satisfied me that there is basically no difficulty in this point or that if there is it counts equally against both opinions but something that counts equally against two contradictory opinions cant be a disproof of either of them i agree but after all philonous when i consider the substance of what you say against scepticism it amounts to no more than this we are sure that we really see hear feel in a word we are sure that we are affected with sensible impressions and what more should we be concerned with i see this cherry i feel it i taste it and i am sure nothing cannot be seen or felt or tasted so the cherry is not nothing and it is therefore real take away the sensations of softness moisture redness tartness and you take away the cherry since it is not a thing distinct from sensations a cherryi repeatis nothing but a heap of sensible impressions or ideas perceived by various senses these ideas are united into one thing or have one name given to them by the mind because they are observed to accompany each other thus when the palate is affected with a certain taste the sight is affected with a red colour the sense of touch with roundness softness etc and when i see and feel and taste in certain particular ways i am sure that the cherry exists or is real because i dont think its reality is anything apart from those sensations but if by the word cherry you mean an unknown nature distinct from all those sensible qualities and by its existence you mean something distinct from its being perceived then indeed i agree that neither you nor i nor anyone else can be sure that it exists but what would you say philonous if i brought the very same reasons against the existence of sensible things in a mind that you have offered against their existing in a material substratum when i see your reasons ill tell you what i have to say to them is the mind extended or unextended unextended without doubt do you say the things you perceive are in your mind they are again have i not heard you speak of sensible impressions i believe you may have explain to me now philonous how there can possibly be room for all those trees and houses to exist in your mind can extended things be contained in something that has no size because it is unextended and are we to imagine impressions made on a thing that has no solidity obviously not you cant say that objects are in your mind as books are in your study or that things are impressed or imprinted on your mind as the shape of a seal is imprinted on wax in what sense therefore are we to understand those expressions explain this to me if you can and i shall then be able to answer all those questions you earlier put to me about my substratum come on hylas when i speak of objects as existing in the mind or imprinted on the senses i dont mean these in the crude literal sense as when bodies are said to exist in a place or a seal to make an impression on wax i mean only that the mind comprehends or perceives them and that it is affected from outside or by some being other than itself this is my explanation of your difficulty i would like to know how it can help to make intelligible your thesis of an unperceiving material substratum no if thats all there is to it i admit that i dont see what use can be made of it but are you not guilty of some misuse of language in this none at all i have merely followed what is authorized by common custom which as you know is what sets the rules for language for nothing is more usual than for philosophers to speak of the immediate objects of the understanding as things existing in the mind and this fits with the general analogy of language most mental operations are signified by words borrowed from sensible things as can be seen in the terms comprehend contain understand reflect bounce back look inward discourse etc when these are applied to the mind they must not be taken in their crude original sense the word discourse comes from latin meaning run to and fro and in berkeleys day it could mean reasoning you have i admit satisfied me about this but there still remains one great difficulty which i dont see how you can overcome indeed it is of such importance that even if you can solve all others if you cant find a solution for this difficulty you mustnt expect to make a convert out of me let me know this mighty difficulty the scriptural account of the creation appears to me to be utterly incompatible with your notions moses tells us of a creation a creation of what of ideas no certainly but of things of real things solid corporeal substances get your principles to conform with this and i shall perhaps agree with you about them in general moses mentions the sun moon and stars earth and sea plants and animals i dont question that all these do really exist and were in the beginning created by god if by ideas you mean fictions and fancies of the mind then the sun moon etc are no ideas if by ideas you mean immediate objects of the understanding or sensible things that cant exist unperceived or out of a mind then those things are ideas but it matters little whether you call them ideas or not that difference is only about a name and whether that name be retained or rejected the sense the truth and reality of things continues the same in common talk the objects of our senses are not called ideas but things youll have no quarrel with me if you go on calling them things provided you dont attribute to them any absolute external existence so i accept that the creation was a creation of things of real things this isnt in the least inconsistent with my principles as is evident from what i have just been saying and would have been evident to you without that if you hadnt forgotten what i so often said before as for solid corporeal substances please show where moses makes any mention of them and if they should be mentioned by him or any other inspired writer it would still be up to you to show that in such texts those words were not used in the common meaning as referring to things falling under our senses but in the philosophical meaning as standing for matter or an unknown something with an absolute mindindependent existence when you have proved these points then and not till then you may bring the authority of moses into our dispute it is useless to dispute about a point that is so clear i am content to refer it to your own conscience cant you see that your views conflict in a special way with moses account of the creation if the first chapter of genesis can be given any possible sense that makes it square with my principles as well as with any others then that chapter has no special conflict with mine and any such sense can be conceived by you because you believe what i believe all you can conceive apart from spirits are ideas and their existence i dont deny and you like me dont claim that they exist outside the mind please let me see any sense in which you can understand that chapter why i imagine that if i had been present at the creation i would have seen things come into existencethat is become perceptiblein the order described by moses i have always believed moses account of the creation and i dont find that my manner of believing it has altered in any way when things are said to begin or end their existence we mean this with regard not to god but to his creatures all objects are eternally known by god or the same thing have an eternal existence in his mind but when things that were previously imperceptible to creatures are by a decree of god made perceptible to them then are they said to come into existence in the sense that they begin a relative existence with respect to created minds so when i read moses account of the creation i understand that the various parts of the world gradually became perceivable to finite spirits that were endowed with proper faculties so that when such spirits were present the things were in truth perceived by them this is the literal obvious sense suggested to me by the words of the holy scripture and in it there is no mention and no thought of substratum instrument occasion or absolute existence and if you look into it i am sure you will find that most plain honest men who believe the creation never think of those things any more than i do what metaphysical sense you may understand the creation story in only you can tell but philonous you seem not to be aware of a terrific problem confronting you arising from the fact that according to you created things in the beginning had only a relative existence and thus a hypothetical existence that is to say they existed if there were men to perceive them you dont allow them any actuality of absolute existence that would have enabled god to create them and not taken the further step of creating men so dont you have to say that its plainly impossible that inanimate things were created before man was and isnt this directly contrary to moses account in answer to that i say first created beings might begin to exist in the mind of other created intelligences besides men to prove any contradiction between moses account and my notions you must first show that there was no other order of finite created spirits in existence before men for my second reply let us think of the creation as it was at the end of the fourth day a collection of plants of all sorts produced by an invisible power in a desert where nobody was present i say that this way of thinking about the creation is consistent with my principles since they deprive you of nothing sensible and nothing imaginable that it exactly suits with the common natural uncorrupted notions of mankind that it brings out the dependence of all things on god and consequently has all the good effect or influence which that important article of our faith could possibly have in making men humble thankful and resigned to their creator i say furthermore that in this naked conception of things with words stripped off you wont find any notion of what you call the actuality of absolute existence you may indeed raise a dust with those terms and so pointlessly lengthen our dispute but i beg you to look calmly into your own thoughts and then tell me if they arent useless and unintelligible jargon i admit that i have no very clear notion annexed to them but what do you say to this dont you make the existence of sensible things consist in their being in a mind and werent all things eternally in the mind of god didnt they therefore exist from all eternity according to you how could something that was eternal be created in time can anything be clearer or better reasoned than this dont you also think that god knew all things from eternity i do consequently they always had an existence in the divine intellect this i acknowledge by your own admission therefore nothing is new nothing begins to be in respect of the mind of god so we are agreed on that point then what are we to make of the creation cant we understand it to have been entirely in respect of finite spirits on that understanding of it things with regard to us can properly be said to begin their existence or be created when god decreed they should become perceptible to intelligent creatures in the order and manner which he then established and which we now call the laws of nature you may call this a relative or hypothetical existence if you please but so long as it supplies us with the most natural obvious and literal sense of moses history of the creation so long as it answers all the religious ends of that great article of faith in a word so long as you can assign no other sense or meaning in place of it why should we reject this is it to comply with a ridiculous sceptical desire to make everything nonsense and unintelligible i am sure you cant say it is for the glory of god for even if it were possible and conceivable that the physical world should have an absolute existence outside the mind of god as well as of the minds of all created spirits how could this display either the immensity or the omniscience of the deity or the necessary and immediate dependence of all things on him wouldnt it indeed seem rather to detract from those attributes well let us look into this decree of gods that things should become perceptible isnt it clear philonous that either god carried out that decree from all eternity or at some particular time he began to will what he hadnt actually willed before but only planned to will if the former then there could be no creation or beginning of existence for finite things if the latter then we must think that something new happened to god which implies a sort of change and all change points to imperfection please think what you are doing isnt it obvious that this objection counts equally against a creation in any sense indeed that it counts against every other act of gods that we can discover by the light of nature we cant conceive any act of gods otherwise than as performed in time and having a beginning god is a being of transcendent and unlimited perfections so finite spirits cant understand his nature it isnt to be expected therefore that any man whether materialist or immaterialist should have exactly correct notions of the deity his attributes and his ways of doing things so if you want to infer anything against me your difficulty mustnt be drawn from the inadequateness of our conceptions of the divine nature which is unavoidable on any system it must rather come from my denial of matter of which there isnt one word said or hinted in what you have just objected i have to agree that the only difficulties you have to clear up are ones that arise from the nonexistence of matter and are special to that thesis you are right about that but i simply cant bring myself to think there is no such special conflict between the creation and your opinion though i am not clear about where exactly it is what more do you want dont i acknowledge a twofold state of things the one copied or natural the other copiedfrom and eternal the former was created in time the latter existed from everlasting in the mind of god isnt this in harmony with what theologians generally say is anything more than this necessary in order to conceive the creation but you suspect some special conflict though you cannot locate it to take away all possibility of doubt about all this just consider this one point either you cant conceive the creation on any hypothesis whatsoever in which case you have no ground for dislike or complaint against my thesis in particular or you can conceive the creation and in that case why not conceive it on my principles since that would not take away anything conceivable my principles have all along allowed you the full scope of sense imagination and reason so anything that you could previously apprehend either immediately by your senses or mediately by inferences from your senses anything you could perceive imagine or understand remains still with you on my principles if therefore the notion you have of the creation by other principles is intelligible you still have it on mine if it isnt intelligible i dont think it is a notion at all and so the loss of it is no loss and indeed it seems to me quite clear that the supposition of mattersomething perfectly unknown and inconceivablecant enable us to conceive anything and i hope i dont need to prove to you that the inference from the creation is inconceivable without matter to matter exists is no good if the existence of matter doesnt make the creation conceivable i admit philonous you have almost satisfied me on this point of the creation i wonder why you arent entirely satisfied you tell me indeed of an inconsistency between moses history and immaterialism but you dont know where it lies is this reasonable hylas can you expect me to solve a difficulty without knowing what it is but setting that aside wouldnt anyone think you are sure that the received notions of materialists are consistent with holy scripture and so i am ought the historical part of scripture to be understood in a plain obvious sense or in a sense that is metaphysical and out of the way in the plain sense doubtless when moses speaks of plants earth water etc as having been created by god dont you think that what this suggests to every unphilosophical reader are the sensible things commonly signified by those words i cant help thinking so and doesnt the doctrine of materialists deny a real existence to all ideas that is all things perceived by sense i have already agreed to this according to them therefore the creation was not the creation of sensible things that have only a relative existence but of certain unknown natures that have an absolute existenceso that they could exist even if there were no spirit to perceive them true isnt it evident therefore that the friends of matter destroy the plain obvious sense of moses with which their notions are utterly inconsistent and instead of it force on us i know not what something equally unintelligible to themselves and me i cant contradict you moses tells us of a creation a creation of what of unknown essences of occasions or substratums no certainly but of things that are obvious to the senses you must first reconcile this with your notions if you want me to be reconciled to them i see you can attack me with my own weapons then as to absolute existence was there ever known a more povertystricken notion than that it is something so abstracted and unintelligible that you have frankly admitted to being unable to conceive it much less to explain anything with its help but even if we allow that matter exists and that the notion of absolute existence is as clear as daylight has this ever been known to make the creation more credible on the contrary hasnt it provided the atheists and infidels down through the centuries with their most plausible argument against a creation this thesis a corporeal substance which has an absolute existence outside the minds of spirits was produced out of nothing by the mere will of a spirit has been seen as so contrary to all reason so impossible and absurd that not only the most celebrated among the ancients but even a variety of modern and christian philosophers have thought matter not to have been created at all but to have existed for ever along with god put these points together and then judge whether materialism disposes men to believe in the creation of things i admit philonous that i dont think it does this creation objection is the last one i can think of and i have to admit that you have sufficiently answered it along with the rest all that remains for me to overcome is a sort of unaccountable resistance that i find in myself towards your notions when a man is swayed to one side of a question without knowing why dont you think that this must be the effect of prejudice which always accompanies old and rooted notions in this respect indeed i cant deny that the belief in matter has very much the advantage over the contrary opinion in the minds of educated men i admit that that seems to be right well then as a counterbalance to this weight of prejudice let us throw into the scale the great advantages that arise from the belief in immaterialism in regard to both religion and human learning the existence of a god and the imperishable nature of the soul those great articles of religion arent they proved with the clearest and most immediate evidence when i say the existence of a god i dont mean an obscure general cause of things of which we have no conception but god in the strict and proper sense of the word a being whose spirituality omnipresence providence omniscience infinite power and goodness are as conspicuous as the existence of sensible things of which despite the fallacious claims and pretended doubts of sceptics there is no more reason to doubt than of our own existence then with relation to human knowledge in natural science what intricacies what obscurities what contradictions has the belief in matter led men into to say nothing of the numberless disputes about its extent continuity homogeneity gravity divisibility etc dont they claim to explain everything in terms of bodies operating on bodies according to the laws of motion and yet can they understand how one body might move another furthermore even if there were no difficulty in reconciling the notion of an inert being such as matter with the notion of a cause or in conceiving how a quality might pass from one body to another this being one theory about how one body can move another namely by passing some motion along to it yet by all their strained thoughts and extravagant suppositions have the materialists been able to understand the mechanical production of any one animal or plant body can they through the laws of motion account for sounds tastes smells or colours or for the regular course of events have they through physical principles accounted for the intricate ways in which even the most inconsiderable parts of the universe hang together if on the other hand we set aside matter and corporeal causes and admit only the effectiveness of an allperfect mind dont all the effects of nature become easy and intelligible if the phenomena are nothing but ideas the choice is obvious god is a spirit but matter is unintelligent and unperceiving if the phenomena point to an unlimited power in their cause god is active and omnipotent but matter is an inert mass if the order regularity and usefulness of the effects of nature can never be sufficiently admired god is infinitely wise and provident but matter doesnt have plans and designs these surely are great advantages in physics not to mention that the belief in a distant god naturally disposes men to be slack in their moral actions which they would be more cautious about if they thought god to be immediately present and acting on their minds without the interposition of matter or unthinking second causes then in metaphysics what difficulties concerning thinghood in the abstract substantial forms hylarchic principles plastic natures substance and accident principle of individuation the possibility of matters thinking the origin of ideas the question of how two independent substances as widely different as spirit and matter could act on each other what difficulties i say and what endless treatises concerning these and countless other similar points do we escape by supposing only spirits and ideas even mathematics becomes much easier and clearer if we take away the absolute existence of extended things the most shocking paradoxes and intricate speculations in the mathematical sciences depend on the infinite divisibility of finite extended things and that depends on the supposition of absolutely existing extended things but what need is there to insist on particular sciences isnt the opposition to all systematic knowledge whatsoeverthat frenzy of the ancient and modern scepticsbuilt on the same foundation can you produce so much as one argument against the reality of bodies or on behalf of that professed utter ignorance of their natures which doesnt presuppose that their reality consists in an external absolute existence once that presupposition is made the objections from the change of colours in a pigeons neck or the broken appearance of an oar in the water do have weight but objections like those vanish if we dont maintain the existence of absolute external originals but place the reality of things in ideas although these ideas are fleeting and changeable they are changed not at random but according to the fixed order of nature for it is thatthe orderliness of our sequences of ideasthat the constancy and truth of things consists in that is what secures all the concerns of life and distinguishes what is real from the irregular visions of the imagination i agree with everything youve just said and must admit that nothing can incline me to embrace your opinion more than the advantages that i see come with it i am by nature lazy and this accepting immaterialism would greatly simplify knowledge what doubts what hypotheses what labyrinths of confusion what fields of disputation what an ocean of false learning can be avoided by that single notion of immaterialism is there now anything further to be done you may remember that you promised to accept whatever opinion appeared on examination to be the most agreeable to common sense and furthest from scepticism this by your own admission is the opinion that denies matter or the absolute existence of bodily things and we have gone further this opinion has been proved in several ways viewed from different angles pursued in its consequences and defended against all objections to it can there be a greater evidence of its truth or could it have all the marks of a true opinion and yet be false i admit that right now i am entirely satisfied in all respects but how can i be sure that i shall go on fully assenting to your opinion and that no new objection or difficulty will turn up tell me hylas when in other cases a point has been clearly proved do you withhold your assent on account of objections or difficulties it may be liable to when you are confronted with a mathematical demonstration rigorously valid proof do you hold out against it because of the difficulties involved in the doctrine of incommensurable quantities of the angle of contact of the asymptotes to curves or the like or will you disbelieve the providence of god because there are some particular things which you dont know how to reconcile with it if there are difficulties in immaterialism there are at the same time direct and evident proofs of it but for the existence of matter there isnt a single proof and there are far more numerous and insurmountable objections count against it anyway where are those mighty difficulties you insist on alas you dont know where or what they are theyre merely something that may possibly turn up in the future if this entitles you to withhold your full assent you should never assent to any proposition however free from objections it may be and however clearly and solidly demonstrated you have satisfied me philonous as armament against all future objections do bear in mind that something bearing equally hard on two contradictory opinions cannot be a proof against either of them so whenever any difficulty in immaterialism occurs to you see if you can find a solution for it on the hypothesis of the materialists dont be deceived by words but test your own thoughts and if you dont find it easier with the help of materialism it obviously cant be an objection against immaterialism if you had followed this rule all along you would probably have spared yourself much trouble in objecting because none of your objections conforms to the rule i challenge you to show one of your difficulties that is explained by matter indeed one that is not made even worse by supposing matter and consequently counts against materialism rather than for it in each particular case you should consider whether the difficulty arises from the nonexistence of matter if it doesnt then arguing from it to the falsity of immaterialism is arguing from a premise to a conclusion that has nothing to do with itno better than arguing from extension is infinitely divisible to god does not have foreknowledge and yet if you think back i believe you will find this to have been often if not always the case in our conversation be careful also not to argue by begging the question that is giving an argument that at the outset assumes the truth of the conclusion one is apt to say the unknown substances ought to be regarded as real things rather than the ideas in our minds and for all we know the unthinking external substance may operate as a cause or instrument in the production of our ideas but doesnt this assume that there are such external substances and isnt this begging the question but above all things you should beware of misleading yourself by that common fallacy which is called mistaking the questionthat is offering against one proposition an argument which really counts only against a quite different proposition you often talked as if you thought i maintained the nonexistence of sensible things whereas in truth noone can be more thoroughly assured of their existence than i am and it is you who doubtno it is you who positively denythat they exist everything that is seen felt heard or in any way perceived by the senses is a real being according to the principles i embrace but not according to the principles that used to be yours remember that the matter you used to defend is an unknown something if indeed it can even be called a something which is completely stripped of all sensible qualities and cant be perceived through the senses or grasped by the mind remember i say that your matter is not any object that is hard or soft hot or cold blue or white round or square etc for i affirm that all these things do exist though i do indeed deny that they exist in any way except by being perceived or that they exist out of all minds whatsoever think about these points consider them attentively and keep them in view otherwise you wont be clear about the state of the question and in that case your objections will always be wide of the mark and instead of counting against my views they may possibly be directed as more than once they have been against yours i have to admit philonous that nothing seems to have kept me from agreeing with you more than this same mistaking the question that you have just warned me against when you deny matter i am tempted at first glance to think that you are denying the things we see and feel but on reflection i find there is no ground for that how about keeping the word matter and applying it to sensible things this could be done without any change in your views and believe me it would reconcile your views to some people who are upset more by your use of words than by your opinions with all my heart retain the word matter and apply it to the objects of sense if you please but dont credit them with existing apart from being perceived i shant quarrel with you over a word matter and material substance are terms introduced by philosophers and as used by them they imply a sort of independence or an existence distinct from being perceived by a mind but common people dont use these terms or if they do it is to signify the immediate objects of sense so one would think that so long as the names of all particular things are retained and also such terms as sensible substance body and stuff the word matter would never be missed in common talk and in philosophical discourses it seems best to leave it out altogether since the use of that general confused termmore perhaps than any other one factorhas favoured and strengthened the depraved tendency of the mind towards atheism well now philonous since i am content to give up the notion of an unthinking substance exterior to the mind i think you should allow me the privilege of using the word matter as i please to signify a collection of sensible qualities existing only in the mind i freely grant that strictly speaking there is no other substance than spirit but i have been accustomed to the term matter for so long that i dont know how to get on without it to say there is no matter in the world is still shocking to me whereas to say there is no matter if by matter is meant an unthinking substance existing outside the mind but if by matter is meant some sensible thing whose existence consists in being perceived then there is matter comes across quite differently and this formulation will bring men to your notions with little difficulty for after all the controversy about matter in the strict sense of matter is not a dispute between you and ordinary folk it lies altogether between you and the philosophers whose principles are admittedly nowhere near so natural or so agreeable to the common sense of mankind and to holy scripture as yours are all our desires are directed towards gaining happiness or avoiding misery but what have happiness or misery joy or grief pleasure or pain to do with absolute existence or with unknown entities abstracted from all relation to us it is obvious that things concern us only insofar as they are pleasing or displeasing and they can please or displease only to the extent that they are perceived beyond that we are not concerned and in this respect you leave things as you found them but still there is something new in this doctrine of yours it is clear to me that i dont now think with the philosophers nor do i entirely think with the common people i would like to know where i stand nowto know precisely what you have added to my former notions or altered in them i dont claim to be a setterup of new notions all im trying to do is bring together and place in a clearer light a truth that used to be shared between the common people and the philosophers the former being of the opinion that the things they immediately perceive are the real things and the latter that the things they immediately perceive are ideas which exist only in the mind these two notions when put together constitute the substance of what i advance for a long time i have distrusted my senses i thought i saw things by a dim light and through false glasses now the glasses are removed and a new light breaks in on my understanding i am clearly convinced that i see things as they are and am no longer troubled about their unknown natures or absolute existence this is the state i find myself in at present though indeed i dont yet fully grasp the line of argument that brought me to it you set out on the same principles that academics sceptics in ancient greece cartesians and similar sects usually do and for a long time it looked as if you were advancing their philosophical scepticism but in the end your conclusions are directly opposite to theirs hylas look at the water of that fountain how it is forced upwards in a round column to a certain height at which it breaks and falls back into the basin from which it rose its ascent as well as its descent come from the same uniform law or principle of gravitation in just that way the same principles which at first view lead to scepticism then when pursued to a certain point bring men back to common sense alciphron or the minute philosopher a defence of the christian religion against the socalled freethinkers george berkeley contents first dialogue freethinking and the general good second dialogue the ethics of mandeville third dialogue the ethics of shaftesbury fourth dialogue the truth of theism fifth dialogue the utility of christianity sixth dialogue the truth of christianity seventh dialogue the truth of christianity i want to consider the various things that a freethinker can beatheist libertine fanatic scorner critic metaphysician fatalist scepticbut you shouldnt think that according to me every individual freethinker is all of these all i am saying is that each item on that list characterizes some freethinkers you may think that no freethinker is an atheist it has often been said that although there are admittedly some atheists who claim to be philosophical theorists noone is really an atheist as a matter of philosophical theory i know these things are said but i am well assured that one of the most noted writers against christianity in our times claims to have discovered a demonstration knockdown proof that there is no god if you take the trouble to consult conversation and books to inform yourself about the principles and tenets of our modern freethinkers im sure youll find that every item on my list is true to life i am not writing only against books dont think that the freethinking authors are being misrepresented if every notion of alciphron or lysicles is not found precisely in what the authors have written we can expect that a man in a private conversation will speak more openly than others write to improve on the hints given by authors of books and draw conclusions from their principles whatever they may claim i believe that all those who write either explicitly or by insinuation against the dignity freedom and immortality of the human soul can on that account be fairly accused of unsettling the principles of morality and destroying the means of making men rationally virtuous we can expect from that direction a lot that is harmful to the interests of virtue a certain admired writer has expressed the view that the cause of virtue is likely to suffer less from those who mock it than from those who tenderly nurse it because the nurses are apt to bundle it up too warmly and kill it with excess of care and cherishing and also make it a mercenary thing by talking so much of its rewards i leave it to you to decide whether this is a fair statement of the situation the dialogues are reported in a long letter written to a friend by a fictional gentleman named dionall the names are greek his opening words echo berkeleys situation when composing this work he was in rhode island facing the probable failure of his plan to start a college in bermuda the dialogues however are located in a quietly rural part of england first dialogue monday i was optimistic enough to believe that by now id have been able to send you an agreeable account of the success of the plan that brought me to this remote corner of the country but all i could report are the details of how it went wrong and i prefer instead to entertain you with some amusing incidents that have helped to soothe me during the inevitable and unforeseeable difficulties that i have encountered events are not in our power but we can always make good use even of the worst and i have to admit that the way this affair went and the outcome of it gave me an opportunity for reflections that help to compensate for my great loss of time and my trouble and expense a mind that is free to reflect on its own processes if it doesnt produce anything useful to the world usually manages to entertain itself for the past several months i have enjoyed that kind of freedom and leisure in this distant place far from that great whirlpool of business struggle and pleasure that is called the world and my enjoyment of this peaceful place has been greatly increased by the conversation and good qualities of my host euphranorhes a philosopher and a farmer two roles that are not so inconsistent in nature as you might think from the time he left the university euphranor has lived in this small town where he has a good house with a hundred acres of land adjoining it after the work he has put into improving the land it provides him with a comfortable income he has a good collection of books mainly old ones left to him by a clergyman uncle who brought him up and the business of his farm doesnt hinder him from making good use of it he has read much and thought more his health and strength of body helping him not to become mentally weary he thinks he can carry on his studies better in the field than in his study and his mind is seldom idle while he prunes the trees follows the plough or looks after his flocks in the house of this honest friend i became acquainted with a wealthy and distinguished friend of euphranors named crito his anglican parish church is in our town one sunday last summer when he was dining at euphranors i asked after his guests whom we had seen at church with him the previous sunday they are both well said crito but having dropped in at the church that one time just to see what sort of congregation our parish could provide they had no further curiosity about the church and so chose to stay at home what said euphranor are they presbyterians no replied crito they are freethinkers euphranor who had never met any member of that species or sect of men and knew little of their writings wanted to know what their principles were what system they accepted that is more than i can tell you said crito their writers have different opinions some go further and state their position more openly than others but the best way to learn about the current ideas of the sect is to talk with those who declare themselves to be freethinkers your curiosity could now be satisfied if you and dion would spend a week at my house with these guests of mine who seem very ready to declare and propagate their opinions alciphron is in his forties and is no stranger to men or to books i knew him first when we were both training as lawyers in london when he came into a rich inheritance he gave up his law studies and travelled through the civilized parts of europe after his return he lived among the amusements of london but he began to find them stale and insipid which threw him into a sort of irritable laziness my other guest lysicles pronounced liesuhclees is a near relative of mine he is a quick and clever young gentleman with some general knowledge about bookish matters after he had completed his formal education and seen a little of the world he became friends with men of pleasure and freethinkers berkeleys exact phrase which i fear has greatly harmed his health and his fortune but what i regret most is the corruption of his mind by a set of harmful principles that he wont ever be cured of they have survived the passions of youth so theres no chance of his losing them now these two would be agreeable enough if only they didnt fancy themselves freethinkers because of this frankly speaking they make it a little too obvious that they think themselves wiser than the rest of the world i would like it if my guests met with their match where they least expected it in a country farmer euphranor replied im not offering to do more than merely inform myself about their principles and opinions so tomorrow ill assign my workers their work for a week and accept your invitation if dion is willing i gave my consent meanwhile said crito ill prepare my guests telling them that an honest neighbour would like to talk with them about their freethinking ill be surprised if they dont like the prospect of leaving a convert behind them even in a country village next morning euphranor rose early and spent the morning putting his affairs in order after lunch we took our walk to critos which lay through half a dozen pleasant fields after walking for about an hour we came to critos house which stands in the middle of a beautiful little park at the door we met a servant carrying a small basket of fruit to a grove where he said his master was with his two guests we found the three of them sitting in the shade and after the usual preliminaries for people meeting for the first time euphranor and i sat down by them we chatted about the beauty of this rural scene the fine season of the year and some improvementsnew methods of agriculturethat had been introduced recently in the adjacent county this gave alciphron an opening to remark that the most valuable improvements came latest i wouldnt be much tempted he said to live in a place where men dont have polished manners or cultivated minds however greatly its land has been improved i realised long ago that there is a gradual progress in human affairs the first care of mankind is to satisfy the cravings of nature next they attend to the conveniences and comforts of life but subduing prejudices and acquiring true knowledgethat herculean labourcomes last because it requires the most perfect abilities and all other advantages prepare the way for it right said euphranor alciphron has mentioned our true defect it has always been thought that as soon as we had provided subsistence for the body our next concern should be to improve the mind but the desire for wealth steps between and occupies mens thoughts were told that thought is what distinguishes man from beast to which i add that freedom of thought makes just as much difference between man and man its the noble upholders of this privilege and perfection of human kindthe freethinkers i mean who have sprung up and multiplied in recent yearsto whom we are indebted for all those important discoveries that ocean of light that has broken in and poured through in spite of slavery and superstition euphranor who is a sincere enemy to both slavery and superstition expressed his admiration for the good people who had saved their country from being ruined by them having spread so much light and knowledge over the land he added that he liked the name freethinker and approved of peoples being free thinkers but in his sense of the term every honest inquirer after truth in any age or country was entitled to it so what about this sect that according to alciphron had recently sprung up what were their tenets euphranor wanted to know what were their discoveriesthe ones through which they brought benefits to mankind he would be grateful if alciphron would inform him about all this that will be no trouble replied alciphron because i myself am one of them and some of the most considerable freethinkers are close friends of mine and seeing that euphranor was listening respectfully he went on very fluently the mind of man is like a piece of land what uprooting ploughing digging and harrowing is to the land is what thinking reflecting and examining is to the human mind theres a right way to cultivate each land that is allowed to stay waste and wild for a long time will be choked with brushwood brambles thorns and other plants that are neither useful nor beautiful similarly in a neglected uncultivated mind many prejudices and absurd opinions will sprout up owing their origin partly to the soil itself the passions and imperfections of the mind of man and partly to seeds that happen to have been scattered there by every wind of doctrine that is raised up by the cunning of politicians the eccentricities of pedants the superstition of fools or the dishonesty of priests what can we expect the human mind to be like today after so many ages of being vulnerable to the frauds of dishonest men and the follies of weak ones its prejudices and errorswhat strong deep roots they must have what a hard job it will be to tear them out but this difficult glorious work is what the modern freethinkers are undertaking alciphron paused and looked around his listeners indeed i said a very praiseworthy undertaking people generally think said euphranor that it is praiseworthy to clear and subdue the earth to tame brute animals to provide nourishment for mens bodies and cure their illnesses but what is all this in comparison to the most excellent and useful undertaking of freeing mankind from their errors and improving and adorning their minds these days replied alciphron people are fools enough not to be able to tell their best benefactors from their worst enemies they have a blind respect for those who enslave them and regard their deliverers as dangerous men who want to undermine accepted principles and opinions it would be a pity if such worthy and able men were to meet with any discouragement it seems to me that a man who spends his time in such a laborious impartial search for truth is a better friend to mankind than the greatest statesman or hero the good that they do is confined to a small part of the world and a short period of time whereas a ray of truth can enlighten the whole world and carry on into future ages im afraid the common herd wont soon come to think like you about this but the better sort educated men with good abilities are properly respectful of those who support light and truth no doubt the clergy are always ready to help and applaud your worthy endeavours upon hearing this lysicles could hardly stifle his laughter and alciphron with an air of pity told i see that you dont know what these men are really like surely you must realise that of all men living the clergy are our greatest enemies they would if they could extinguish the light of nature itself turn the world into a dungeon and keep mankind for ever in chains and darkness i never imagined anything like this of our protestant clergy particularly the anglican ones whom i would have expectedgoing by what i have seen of them and their writingsto be lovers of learning and useful knowledge believe me priests of all religions are the same where there are priests there will be priestcraft and where there is priestcraft there will be a persecuting spirit you can depend on them to exercise their full persecutory power against anyone who has the courage to think for himself and who refuses to be hoodwinked and shackled by his reverend leaders those great masters of hairsplitting and jargon have fabricated various systemswhich this is added sarcastically are all equally true and equally important for the world everyone is wedded to his own sect and furiously attacks all those who disagree with it the next sentence speaks of the magistrate a term that will occur several more times in these dialogues it is a kind of shorthand for judges and anyone else who is involved in the enforcement of the law of the land sometimes as on page it seems to cover also lawmakers the chief vices of priests and churchmen all over the world are cruelty and ambition so they do their best to get the upper hand over the rest of mankind and the magistratehaving a joint interest with the priest in subduing confusing and scaring the peopletoo often lends a hand to the church authorities who always think that their authority and possessions arent safe until those whose opinions are different from their own are deprived of their rights including the rights belonging to their social status and even their rights as human beings picture to yourselves a monster or ghost made up of superstition and fanaticism the offspring of statecraft and priestcraft rattling chains in one hand and with the other brandishing a flaming sword over the land and threatening destruction to all who dare to follow the dictates of reason and common sense just think about this and then say if our undertaking isnt dangerous as well as difficult and yet because of the noble ardour that truth inspires our freethinkers are neither overcome by the difficulty nor daunted by the danger in spite of both we have already made so many converts among people of the better sort that we hope to be able eventually to carry all before us beat down the walls of secular and ecclesiastical tyranny break the fetters and chains of our countrymen and restore the original inherent rights liberties and privileges of mankind having said all this in a highly emotional way alciphron paused to get his breath back but nobody answered him euphranor was staring at him mouth open so alciphron went on turning to euphranor he spoke less excitedly the more innocent and honest a man is the more vulnerable he is to being taken in by the plausible claims of other men you have probably encountered writings by our theologians that discuss grace virtue goodness and such matterswritings that are fit to confuse and deceive a simple honest mind but however much they may whitewash their designs they are all basically engaged in the same selfish project i dont deny that among the theologians there may be here and there a poor halfwitted man who means no harm but i dont hesitate to say that all the men of sense among them are fundamentally driven by ambition avarice and vengefulness while alciphron was speaking a servant came to tell him and lysicles that some men who were about to set off for london were waiting to receive their orders so they both got up and went towards the house as soon as they were gone euphranor remarked to crito that he thought the poor gentleman must have been made to suffer greatly because of his freethinking because he seemed to speak with the passion and resentment natural to men who have been treated very badly i dont believe it answered crito in members of his sectie freethinkersi have often noticed two conversational faults namely highflown rhetoric and teasing depending on whether their mood of the moment is tragic or comic sometimes they work themselves into high passions and are then frightened by the ghosts they have created when they are having one of those fits every assistant parson of a little country church is seen as an inquisitor at other times they adopt a sly joking manner using hints and allusions saying little but insinuating much and overall seeming to amuse themselves at the expense of the subject and of their adversaries if you want to know what they really believe youll have to get them to speak up and not to ramble off the topic they tend to go on about being persecuted for freethinking but they have no good reason for this because everyone is perfectly free to think what he pleases i dont know of any persecution in england for opinion intellectual attitude or thought but i suppose that in every country some care is taken to restrain obscene speech and to discourage an outward contempt for what the public holds sacred whatever the persons inward thoughts may be whether this care in england has recently become so excessive as to distress the subjects of this formerly free and easy government whether the freethinkers can fairly complain of any hardship suffered because of conscience or opinion youll be better placed to judge when you hear their account of the numbers progress and notions of their sect im sure they will tell you all this fully and freely provided nobody present seems shocked or offended for in that case they may tone things down out of sheer good manners i am never angry with any man for his opinion said euphranor whether hes a jew turk or idolworshipper he can speak his mind freely to me without fear of offending i would even be glad to hear what he has to say provided he says it in an honest open manner whoever digs in the mine of truth is my fellowlabourer i think but if while i am trying hard he amuses himself by teasing me and flinging dust in my eyes ill soon be tired of him in the meantime alciphron and lysicles having settled their bit of business returned to us lysicles sat down in the same place as before but alciphron stood in front of us with his arms folded and his head leaning on his left shoulder in the posture of a man meditating we sat silent so as not to disturb his thoughts and after two or three minutes he said oh truth oh liberty after which he went on musing at this point euphranor ventured to interrupt him alciphron he said it isnt fair to spend your time in silent soliloquies in this corner of the world we dont often get a chance to have a conversation with learned and wellinformed men and the opportunity you have put into my hands is too valuable for me not to make the best use of it are you then a sincere devotee of truth and can you stand the freedom of a fair inquiry thats what i want more than anything what on every subject on the notions that you first took in with your mothers milk and that have ever since been fed to you by other nursesparents pastors tutors religious assemblies books of devotion and other such devices for taking hold of mens minds i love information on all subjects that come my way and especially on those that are most important well then if you are in earnest stay fair and stand firm while i probe your prejudices and wipe out your principleswhile i pull from your heart your hoary old wives tales he says this in latin quoting the poet persius whereupon alciphron frowned paused and then launched forth if we take the trouble to dig down to the bottom of things and analyse the basic principles on which opinions rest well find that the opinions that are thought to be the most important have the flimsiest bases being derived either from the casual customs of the country where we live or from indoctrination that we were subjected to before we could tell right from wrong true from false alciphron is about the speak of the vulgar and to say what he means by that word broadly speaking its sense at that time was common ordinary runofthemill not very educated not possessed of serious intellectual interestssomething along those lines it didnt have the sense of rude crude badmannered or the like in the present work vulgar is sometimes used as a term of disdain or condescension to refer to people who wouldnt have counted as vulgar is the sober strictly literal sense of the word the vulgarmeaning all the people who dont make a free use of their reasontend to regard these prejudices as sacred and unquestionable believing them to be imprinted on the hearts of men by god himself or conveyed by revelation from heaven or so intrinsically clear and evident that one cant help accepting them without any inquiry or examination in this way the shallow vulgar have their heads full of fancies principles and doctrinesreligious moral and politicalall of which they maintain with a level of energy that is proportional to their lack of reason on the other hand those who properly used their faculties in the search for truth are especially careful to weed out of their minds any notions or prejudices that were planted in them before they were old enough to use reason freely and completely our modern freethinkers have actually done this as well as shrewdly dissecting the generally accepted systems of belief they have traced every established prejudice to its sourcethe real reasons why people believe what they believe and in the course of doing thisand getting a comprehensive overview of the various parts and ages of the worldthey have been able to observe an amazing variety of customs and rites of religious and civil institutions of ideas and beliefs that are very unlike and even contrary to one another which conclusively shows that they cant all be true yet each of them is maintained by its supporters with the same air of confidence the same energetic earnestness and when they are examined they all turn out to have the very same foundationnamely the strength of prejudice with the help of these observations and discoveries they have broken the chains of popular custom and having freed themselves from fraud they now generously lend a hand to their fellowsubjects to lead them into the same paths of light and liberty that is a quick summary of the views and projects of the socalled freethinkers if anything that i have said or anything ill say later is contrary to your preconceived opinions and therefore shocking and disagreeable to you youll pardon the openness and plainness of a philosopher and remember that whenever i displease you in that way i am doing it out of respect for the truth and obedience to your own commands im well aware that eyes long kept in the dark cant bear a sudden view of noonday light and must be brought to it by degrees for that reason the able freethinkers proceed gradually starting with the prejudices to which men are least attached and then moving on to undermine the rest by slow and imperceptible degrees till they have demolished the whole fabric of human folly and superstition but i dont have time here to come at things in that roundabout way ill have to proceed directly and plainlymore so perhaps than will be thought prudent and wellmannered we assured him he was entirely free to speak his mind concerning things persons and opinions without holding anything back that is a freedom alciphron replied that we freethinkers are as willing to give as we are to take it we like to call things by their right names and we cant bear having truth suffer because people politely let falsehoods pass without challenge so let us settle this in advance noone will take offence at anything whatsoever that is said on either side we agreed to this well then said alciphron let us start our pursuit of the truth by supposing that i have been brought up inlets saythe church of england the anglican church when i reach maturity of judgment and think about the particular forms of worship and opinions of this church i dont remember when or how they first took possession of my mind as i look back i find them to have been in my mind for as far back as my memory of anything stretches then looking at the upbringing of children as a basis for a judgment about how my own upbringing went i see them being instructed in religious matters before they can reason about them so that all such instruction is nothing but filling the tender mind of a child with prejudices this leads me to reject all those religious ideas regarding them as on a par with the other follies of my childhood i am confirmed in this attitude when i widen my view and see roman catholics and various sects of protestants which all agree in a general profession of belief in christ but differ vastly one from another regarding details of faith and worship then i widen my view still further so as to take in jews and moslems i see that they agree a little with christiansin that they all believe in one godbut each of these religions has its own special laws and revelations for which it expresses the same respect as the others have for their laws and revelations looking further afield still to examine heathen and idolatrous nations i discover an endless variety not only in details of doctrine and forms of worship but even in the very notion of a god in which they differ widely from one another and from all the other sects i have mentioned the bottom line is that instead of simple and uniform truth i see nothing but discord opposition and wild claims all springing up from the prejudices of upbringing from reflecting on and thinking about these facts thoughtful men have concluded that all religions are falseare fables the reason why one man is a christian another a jew a third a moslem a fourth a heathen idolater is that each happened to be brought up in that particular sect so just as each of these contending parties condemns the rest so an unprejudiced bystander will condemn and reject them en bloc seeing that they all originate from the same errorrich source and are kept going by the same techniques to meet the same purposes of the priest and the magistrate see note on page so you think that the magistrate goes along with the priest in misleading the people i do and so must everyone who considers things in a true light for you must know that the magistrates main aim is to keep the people under him in awe now the public eye restrains men from open offences against the laws and government but to prevent secret crimes a magistrate finds it expedient that men should believe that gods eye is watching over their private actions and designs and to intimidate those who might otherwise be drawn into crimes by the prospect of pleasure and profit he tells them that whoever escapes punishment in this life will be sure to find it in the afterlifewhere it will be so heavy and longlasting that it infinitely outweighs any pleasure or profit that he got from his crimes so it has come about that the beliefs that there is a god the soul is immortal and there is a future state of rewards and punishments have been valued as useful engines of government these are rather notional airy doctrines and the rulers need them to impress themselves on peoples senses and to be retained in their minds and so the rulers of the various civilized nations of the earth have skillfully devised temples sacrifices churches rites ceremonies clerical clothing music prayer preaching and other such spiritual foolery all of which helps the priest to prosper in his career and satisfies the magistrate by frightening and subduing the people thats the source of the alliance between church and state religion established by law and the rights immunities and incomes of priests all over the world every government wants you to fear god so that youll honour the king or civil power crito and i heard this speech of alciphrons with the utmost attention but without looking surprisedand indeed for us there was nothing new or unexpected in it but euphranor who had never before been present at such conversation couldnt help showing some astonishment and lysicles who noticed it asked him brightly how he liked alciphrons lecture i think its the first you ever heard of that kind he said and youll have needed a strong stomach to digest it i admit that i dont have the quickest digestion but it has sometimes gradually been able to assimilate things that at first seemed indigestible right now i admire alciphrons free spirit and eloquence but frankly im astonished by his opinions rather than convinced of their truth what he said turning to alciphroncan you really not believe in the existence of a god to be plain with you i do not but this is what i thought would happen a flood of light let in on the mind all at once is more likely to dazzle and disorder the mind than to enlighten it if i werent short of time i would have begun in the regular way first describing the features of religion that arent essential to it then attacking the mysteries of christianity after that proceeding to what christianity teaches about conduct and finally wiping out the belief in a god this last being the first taught of all the religious prejudices and the basis of the rest so that it has taken the deepest root in our minds im not surprised that you still have this belief this prejudice because i have known a number of very able men who had trouble freeing themselves from it not everyone has the same speed and energy of thinking as you do i for one find it hard to keep up with you to help you ill go back a little and pick up the thread of my reasoning first i must tell you that having thought hard about the idea of truth i have found truth to be stable permanent and uniformnot various and changeable like modes or fashions or matters of taste in the next place having observed many sects and splinters from sects adopting very different and contrary opinions while all professing christianity i rejected any doctrine on which they didnt all agree and kept only the one that was agreed to by all and so i became a latitudinarian roughly someone who is a christian in a broad sense with no interest in the details of doctrine church government forms of worship etc that divide branches of christianity from one another after going on to attend to more of the facts i saw that christians jews and moslems have their different systems of faith agreeing only in the belief that there is one god and so i became a deist roughly someone who rejects miracles revelation anything supernatural and has no interest in any organized church or form of worship but believes that natural evidence points to there being a god lastly i extended my view to all the many nations that inhabit this globe and found that they didnt agreewith one another or with any of the sects i have mentionedon any point of faith not even on the notion of a god so i became an atheist because i think that a man of courage and good sense should follow his argument wherever it leads him and that nothing is more ridiculous than to be a freethinker by halves i approve of the man who does the job thoroughlynot merely lopping off the branches but pulling up the root from which they grew regarding this next bit the grand arcanum was the mythical philosophers stone which was reputed to transform lead into gold andor perform other wonders alciphrons ironical use of the term may be meant to indicate that atheism transforms large parts of ones beliefsystem in berkeleys day calling someone a genius was stronger than merely calling him clever but had less force than genius does in our day so you see that atheismwhich frightens women and foolsis the very peak and perfection of freethinking it is the grand arcanum to which a true genius naturally risesperhaps gradually perhaps as a sudden intellectual breakthroughand without it he can never have absolute freedom and peace in his soul to become thoroughly convinced about this central point just examine the notion of a god with the same freedom that you would examine any other prejudice track it back to its source and you wont find that you acquired it through any of your senses though these are in fact the only true means of discovering what is real and substantial in nature youll find it lying among other old lumber in some obscure corner of your imagination the proper dumpingground for visions fancies and prejudices of all kinds and if you are more attached to this bit of lumber than you are to the rest thats only because it is the oldest that is all take my word for it and not just mine but that of many of the ablest men of our times whose views about god are the same as mine they really are though some of these people think they should go more gently in declaring to the world their opinion on this matter than on most others and i have to admit that in england there are still too many people who retain a foolish prejudice against the label atheist but that is lessening every day among people of the better sort and when itie the prejudice against the word atheisthas faded to nothing our freethinkers can then at last be said to have given the deathblow to religion because its obvious that so long as people think that god exists religion must survive in some shape or other but once the root has been plucked up all its offspring will wither and decay as a matter of course the offspring im talking about are all those whimsical notions of conscience duty principle and the like which fill a mans head with worries awe him with fears and make him more thoroughly a slave than is the horse he rides its a thousand times better to be hunted by debtcollectors or bailiffs with subpoenas than to be haunted by these spectres of conscience etc which trouble and embitter all his pleasures creating the most real and severe slavery on earth but the freethinker with a vigorous flight of thought breaks through those airy traps and asserts his basic independence others may talk and write and fight about liberty and outwardly claim to have it but only the freethinker is truly free when alciphron ended this speech with an air of triumph euphranor said to him you make clear work it seems that the gentlemen who believe as you do are admirable weeders you have rooted up a world of notions now show me what fine things you have planted in place of them be patient euphranor ill show you first that we leave untouched whatever was sound and good encouraging it to grow in the mind of man and secondly ill show you what excellent things we have planted there pushing on with our close and severe scrutiny we eventually arrive at something solid and real on which all mankind agree namely the appetites passions and senses these are rooted in nature are real have real objects and bring with them real and substantial pleasuresfood drink sleep and other such animal enjoyments being what all men like and love and if we extend our view to the other kinds of animals well find that they all have certain natural appetites and senses which they are constantly engaged in gratifying and satisfying we are so far from destroying these real natural good things which have nothing notional or fanciful about them that we do our best to cherish and improve them according to us every wise man regards himselfie his own bodily existence in this present worldas the centre and ultimate end of all his actions and concerns he regards his appetites as natural guides that will direct him to his proper good and regards his passions and senses as the natural true means of enjoying this good so he tries to keep his appetites alert and his passions and senses strong and lively and works very hard in every possible way to provide the greatest quantity and variety of real objects suited to them a man who can do this without restraint remorse or fear is as happy as any other animal whatsoeveras happy as his nature is capable of being there i have given you a condensed view of the principles discoveries and beliefs of the select spirits here the best minds of this enlightened age after a polite little toandfro about the need for open frankness on both sides the discussion continues i am half ashamed said euphranor to admit that i have a weakness that lesser minds are prone to im no great genius i have favourite opinions that you represent as errors and prejudices for instance the immortality of the soul is a notion im fond of because it supports the mind with a very pleasing prospect if it is wrong i might side with cicero who said that in that case he would be sorry to know the truth and speaking of certain philosophers of his time who taught that the human soul was mortal said that he had nothing to thank them for those philosophers seem to have been predecessors of those who are now called freethinkers euphranor goes on to remark that freethinker is too general a name and that he has no objection to thinking freely he proposes that the sect be given the name that cicero gave them with all my heart what name is it why he calls them minute philosophers this is minute small not seconds euphranors point is of course not that these philosophers are small but that they represent valuable things as small or of small importance alciphron will soon suggest a different meaning for the label right said crito the modern freethinkers are just like the ones that cicero called minute philosophers its an excellent name for them because they diminish all the most valuable thingsthe thoughts views and hopes of men they reduce all the knowledge ideas and theories that men have to sense they shrink and downgrade human nature to the narrow low standard of animal life and they assign to us only a small pittance of time instead of immortality alciphron very gravely remarked that the gentlemen of his sect had not insulted man and that if man is a little shortlived negligible animal it wasnt their saying it that made him so and they were no more to blame for whatever defects they reveal in themselves than a good mirror is to blame for making the wrinkles that it shows as for your remark that those we now call freethinkers were in ancient times called minute philosophers i suggest that this label may have come from their considering things minutely rather than swallowing them in great lumps as other men usually do anyway we all know that the best eyes are necessary to pick out the minutest objects so it seems that minute philosophers might have been socalled because they were so sharpsighted o alciphron these minute philosophers that is the right name for them are like pirates who plunder everything that comes in their way i feel like a man who has been left stripped and desolate on a bleak beach but who are these profound and learned men that in recent years have demolished the whole fabric that lawgivers philosophers and theologians had been erecting for so many ages lysicles smiling said he believed euphranor was imagining philosophers in square caps and long gowns and that in these happy times the reign of pedantry was over our philosophers he said are very different from the awkward students who try to get knowledge by poring over dead languages and ancient authors or by shutting themselves off from the cares of the world to meditate in solitude they are the best bred men of the age men who know the world men of pleasure men of fashion and fine gentlemen i have some idea of the people youre talking about but i would never have taken them for philosophers nor would anyone else until quite recently it seems that for centuries everyone mistakenly thought that the way to knowledge was through a tedious course of academic education and study but one of the chief discoveries of the present time is that such a method slows down and blocks knowledge rather than promoting it crito is of course speaking sarcastically he doesnt actually side with the minute philosophers he will keep up this tone until page where he will come into the open his open attacks on the minute philosophy in the second dialogue are the most rhetorically vivid and passionate things that berkeley ever wrote there are two strands in academic study reading and thinking what the students mainly read are ancient authors in dead languages so that much of their time is spent in learning words which once theyve been laboriously mastered reward the scholar with old and obsolete ideas that are now quite exploded and abandoned as for their thinking what good can possibly come of it if someone doesnt have the right materials to think about he can think and meditate for ever without getting anywhere those cobwebs that scholars spin out of their own brains are neither useful nor beautiful theres only one way to get proper ideas or materials of thought and that is by keeping good company i know several gentlemen who since their appearance in the world the nonacademic world or perhaps more narrowly the world of high society and fashion have spent as much time rubbing off the rust and pedantry of a college education as they had first spent acquiring it ill bet that a fourteenyearold who is brought up in the modern way will make a better showing and be more admired in any drawingroom or assembly of cultivated people than a twentyfouryearold who has set aside long time for studies at school and college hell say better things in a better manner and be more liked by good judges where does he pick up all this improvement where our solemn ancestors would never have looked for it in a drawingroom a coffeehouse a tavern a gambling den in fashionable places like these its the custom for cultivated persons to speak freely on all subjectsreligious moral or political so that a young gentleman who spends much time in them is in a position to hear many instructive lectures spiced with wit and teasing and uttered with energy three or four welldelivered sentences from a man of quality make more of an impression and convey more knowledge than a dozen dry academic lectures so theres no method no set course of studies in those places none but an easy free conversation which takes up every topic that anyone offers without any rule or design i always thought that to get any useful amount of knowledge one needed some order in ones studies that haste and confusion create selfsatisfied ignorance that our advances cant be secure unless they are gradual and that one should start by learning things that might cast a light on what was to follow so long as learning could be obtained only by that slow formal course of study few of the better people knew much of it but now that learning has grown into a pastime our young gentry and nobility unknowingly absorb it during their other pastimes and make a considerable progress thats presumably why there are so many minute philosophers crito resumes his sarcastic pretended admiration for the minute philosophers then it would seem then that method exactness and hard work are a positive disadvantage here alciphron turning to lysicles said he could make the point very clear if euphranor had any notion of painting i never saw a firstrate picture in my life but i have a pretty good collection of prints and have seen some good drawings so you know the difference between the dutch and the italian manner i have some idea of it well then compare a drawing done by the exact and laborious touches of a dutch pencil with a drawing casually dashed off in the free manner of a great italian master the dutch piece which has taken so much trouble and time will indeed be exact but it wont have the force spirit or grace that appear in the italian drawing and are the effects of an easy free pencil apply this example to our discussion and youll get my point tell me did those great italian masters begin and continue in their art without any choice of method or subject and always draw with the same ease and freedom or did they conform to some method beginning with simple and elementary partsan eye a nose a fingerwhich they drew with great effort and care often drawing the same thing over and over again so as to get it right and so gradually acquiring through patience and hard work through many years the free masterly manner you speak of if the latter is right i leave you to apply the example to our discussion so that you will get my point dispute the matter if you like but a man of many talents is one thing and a pedant is another hard methodical work may do for some kinds of people it takes a long time to ignite wet straw and when you do you get a vile smothering flame whereas spirits blaze out at once the minute philosophers have it seems better talents than other men which qualifies them for a different education tell me euphranor what does one man get to look good in a way that others dont what causes him to be more polished in how he dresses how he speaks and how he moves nothing but keeping good company that is also how men gradually and unconsciously get a delicate taste a refined judgment a certain polish in thinking and expressing themselves its not surprising that you folk who live out in the country arent acquainted with the advantage of elegant conversation which constantly keeps the mind awake and active making use of its abilities and demanding all its strength and spirit on a thousand different occasions and on subjects that never come in the way of a bookworm in a college any more than a ploughman hence the lively faculties quickness of uptake slyness of ridicule and enormous talent of wit and humour that distinguish the gentlemen who believe as you do it should seem then that your sect is made up of what you call fine gentlemen not altogether for we have among us some thoughtful people whose upbringing was coarser but though they cant be called fine gentlemen they have made fine contributions to our cause having observed the behaviour of apprentices watermen porters and the gatherings of rabble in the streets they have arrived at a profound knowledge of human nature and made great discoveries about the sources springs and motives of moral actions the phrase moral actions standardly meant actions that do or could involve consciously held reasons or purposes these discoveries have demolished the accepted systems of morality and done a world of good in the city we have men of all sorts and professionsplodding citizens thriving stockbrokers skillful men of business elegant courtiers gallant men of the armybut our chief strength comes from those promising young men who have the advantage of a modern education these are the growing hopes of our sect through their influence we expect the great things we have in view will be actually accomplished i would never have thought your sect was so considerable many honest folk in england are as much in the dark about these matters as you are it would be wrong to infer what the prevailing opinion among people of fashion is from what is said by a legislator in parliament a judge on the bench or a priest in the pulpit they all speak according to law ie according to the reverend prejudices of our forefathers you should go into good company and take note of what able and wellbred men say those who are most listened to and most admired in public gatherings as well as in private conversations only someone who has these opportunities can know our real strength our numbers and the impression we make on the world by your account there must be many minute philosophers among the men of rank and fortune a good many and they contribute greatly to the spreading of our notions anyone who knows the world has to know that fashions always come from above so the right way to propagate an opinion is to start at the upper end of society also the patronage of men of rank and fortune is an encouragement to our authors so you have authors among you we do indeed a number of them and they are very great men who have favoured the world with many useful and profound discoveries he is now laying on really thick his sarcastically intended rhetoric in favour of the minute philosophers he will soon drop it altogether the proper names in this speech refer to real people the device of giving ones targets ancientsounding names was a common practice in polemical writing at that time moschon for instance has proved that man and beast are really of the same nature and that consequently a man needs only to indulge his senses and appetites to be as happy as a brute gorgias has gone further demonstrating that man is a piece of clockwork a machine and that thought or reason are the same thing as the collision of balls cimon has made distinguished use of these discoveries proving as clearly as any proposition in mathematics that conscience is a whim and morality a prejudice and that a man is no more accountable for his actions than a clock is for striking what tryphon has written about the usefulness of vice cant be refuted thrasenor has destroyed the foolish prejudice men had against atheism showing that a republic of atheists might live very happily together demylus has made a joke of loyalty and convinced the world that theres nothing in it we owe to him and to another philosopher of the same type the discovery that public spirit is a pointless fanaticism that seizes only on weak minds i could go on indefinitely reciting the discoveries made by writers of this sect but the masterpiece and coup de grace for the old system is a learned work by our great diagoras containing a demonstration of the nonexistence of god it hasnt yet been published because the public are thought to be not yet ripe for it but im assured by some judicious friends who have seen it that its as clear as daylight and will do a world of good by demolishing at one blow the whole system of religion these discoveries are published by our philosophers sometimes in bound books but often merely in pamphlets and loose pages making it easier for them to be spread through the kingdom they deserve the credit for the absolute and independent freedom that is growing so fast and frightening the bigots even dull and ignorant people start to open their eyes and to be influenced by the example and authority of so many able men it should seem by this accountor rather by what crito last saidthat your sect extend their discoveries beyond religion and that the minute philosopher regards loyalty to his king and reverence for the laws as lowdown things very lowdown we are too wise to think there is anything sacred about the king or the constitution or indeed about anything else a man of sense may seem to show an occasional deference to his king but thats as hollow as his deference to god when he kneels at the sacrament so as to qualify himself for an office government job fear god and honour the king are two slavish maxims that had for a long time cramped human nature and awed not only weak minds but even men of good understanding until their eyes were opened by our philosophers its easy to see that when the fear of god is quite extinguished the mind must take a relaxed attitude to other duties as soon as those other duties lose their hold on the conscience which always presupposes the existence of a god they become mere outward pretences and formalities but i still thought that englishmen of all schools of thought however much they may differ on many details agreed in the belief in god and accepted at least the propositions of socalled natural religion i have already told you my own opinion on those matters and what i know to be the opinion of many others i think i know what has led you astray euphranor the minute philosophers are sometimes called deists see note on page which has led you to imagine that they believe in and worship a god according to the light of nature but if you live among them youll soon be convinced of the contrary they have neither time nor place nor form of divine worship they dont offer prayers or praises to god in public and in their private lives they show a disregard or dislike even of the duties of natural religion for example saying grace before and after meals this is a plain point of natural worship and there was a time when everyone did it but in proportion as this sect of minute philosophers prevailed it has been laid aside not only by the minute philosophers themselves but also by others who are afraid of being thought fools by the minute philosophers are you really saying that men who genuinely believe in a god decline to perform such an easy and reasonable duty for fear of being sneered at by atheists yes i am many people who believe in their hearts the truth of religion are afraid or ashamed to admit it lest they should lose their standing in the eyes of those who have the good luck to be regarded as great wits and men of genius we must make allowance for critos prejudice euphranor he is a worthy gentleman and means well but doesnt it look like prejudice to ascribe the respect that is paid our ingenious freethinkers to good luck rather than to merit im sure their merit is very wonderful it would take a great man to prove such paradoxeseg that someone as knowledgeable as a minute philosopher should be a mere machine or at best no better than a brute it is a true maxim that a man should think with the learned and speak with the vulgar berkeley had already famously said this in his principles of human knowledge regarding the vulgar see note on page i would be very reluctant to describe a gentleman of merit as a machine to an audience of prejudiced and ignorant men the doctrines of our philosophy have something in common with many other truths in metaphysics geometry astronomy and natural science namely that vulgar ears cant bear them all our discoveries and ideas are in themselves true and certain but they are at present known only to the better people and would sound strange and odd among the vulgar its to be hoped that this will eventually wear off im not surprised that vulgar minds should be startled by the ideas of your philosophy truly a very curious sort of philosophy and much to be wondered at the deep thinkers in the minute philosophy camp have gone in exactly the opposite way to all the great philosophers of earlier ages who tried to raise and refine humanity removing it as far as possible from the brute to moderate and subdue mens appetites to remind men of the dignity of their nature to awaken and improve their higher faculties and direct them onto the noblest objects to fill mens minds with a high sense of god of the supreme good and of the immortality of the soul but our minute philosophers seem to go the opposite way from all other wise and thoughtful men because they aim to erase from the mind of man the sources of all that is great and good to disrupt the order of civil life to undermine the foundations of morality and to bring us down to the maxims and way of thinking of the most uneducated and barbarous nations and even to pull humanity down to the level of brute beasts and through all this they want to be accepted by the world as men of deep knowledge but all this negative knowledgedoes it come down to anything better than downright savage ignorance that there is no god no spirit no afterlife no moral duty truly a fine system for an honest man to accept or for a clever man to be proud of alciphron who heard this discourse with some uneasiness very gravely replied disputes are not to be decided by the weight of authority he said but by the force of reason call our notions brutish and barbarous if you please but its a kind of brutishness and barbarism that few people would be capable of if men of the greatest genius hadnt cleared the logjam because theres nothing harder than to overcome ones upbringing and conquer old prejudices it takes great courage and great strength of faculties to pick out and cast off a heap of rubbish that has been gathering in the soul from our very infancy so our philosophers thoroughly deserve to be called esprits forts men of strong heads freethinkers and so on labels that indicate great strength and freedom of mind the heroic labours of these men may be represented for anything can be misrepresented as piratically plundering and stripping the mind of its wealth and ornaments when really they are only divesting it of its prejudices and reducing it to its untainted original state of naturebeautiful pure nature you seem to be impressed by the beauty of nature please alciphron tell me what the things are that you regard as natural how are we to recognize something as natural for a thing to be natural to the mind of man to start with that special case it must appear in the human mind originally from the outset from birth be present universally in the minds of all men and be invariably the same in all nations and ages these threeoriginalness universality invariability exclude all the notions that humans have as results of custom and upbringing this also holds for all other species of beings a cats inclination to pursue a mouse is natural because it satisfies the above three criteria but if a cat is taught to play tricks you wont say that the tricks are natural for the same reason if peaches and apricots are grafted onto a plumtree nobody will say they are the natural growth of that tree lets get back to the human case it seems that the only things youll count as natural in mankind are ones that show themselves at the time of a persons first entrance into the worldnamely the senses and such passions and appetites as reveal themselves as soon as their respective objects appeareg hunger when there is milk fear when there is a loud noise and so on that is my opinion qa note euphranor now asks alciphron seven rhetorical questions to the first six of which alciphron gives the expected answers including it seems so i do and it is true to spare us the tedious questionandanswer routine the questions will appear here as simple statements with the first six answers omitted this condensing device will be used on fourteen other occasions each marked by four or more statements by euphranor labelled with roman numerals and a mention of this note i the leaves blossom and apples of an apple tree are natural to it although it doesnt have them from the outset ii the appetite of lust and the faculty of reason are natural to a man even though they dont shoot forth open and display themselvesas leaves and blossoms do in a treeuntil long after his original infancy iii so it seems that you were being rash when you said that the first criterion for somethings being natural to the mind was that it should appear in it originally iv also it is natural for an orange tree to produce oranges v but if you plant such a tree at the north end of great britain you may if you work hard at it get a good salad ie leaves but no fruit in the southern parts of the island hard careful work may get it to produce mediocre fruit but in portugal or naples it will produce much better fruit with little or no trouble on the part of the farmer vi the plant is the same in all these places but it doesnt produce the same fruit sun soil and cultivation make a difference vii and since according to you its the same story for every species cant we conclude that some things may be natural to mankind although they are not found in all men and arent invariably the same where they are found hold on euphranor you must explain yourself further i shant be rushed into conceding your points youre right to be wary alciphron i dont like these ensnaring questions i dont want you to go along with me out of politeness just tell me what you think about each particular matter so that we understand one another know what we agree on and proceed together in finding out the truth our opinions will stand the test we fear no trial proceed as you please see qa note on page i we seem to have found that things may be natural to men without actually being on display in all men or not as completely on display because differences of culture and other advantages affect what comes of human nature as much as they do with the nature of plants i am using your own comparison ii men at all times and places when they arrive at a certain age express their thoughts by speech iii so it seems that language is natural iv yet there is a great variety of languages v from all this it follows that a thing may be natural and yet admit of variety vi it seems to follow that a thing may be natural to mankind without having the marks of naturalness that you presentie without being original universal and invariable vii consequently religious worship and civil government may be natural to man despite the fact that they occur in a variety of forms and in different degrees of perfection viii you have granted already that reason is natural to mankind ix so whatever is agreeable to reason is agreeable to the nature of man x doesnt it follow from this that truth and virtue are natural to man whatever is reasonable i admit to be natural the fruits that we value most are the ones that come from the most strongly growing and mature stock in the choicest soil similarly then oughtnt we to value most the sublime truths that are the fruits of mature thought and have been rationally deduced by men with the best and most developed minds and if this is right and these things are in fact reasonable natural and true they oughtnt to be written off as unnatural whims errors of upbringing and groundless prejudices just because they are raised and developed by manuring and cultivating young human minds ie because they take root early and bring forth early fruit through the care and diligence of our instructors agreed provided that they can still be rationally deduced but to take for granted that what men vulgarly call the truths of morality and religion have a rational basis would be begging the question he means that it would be in effect including the conclusion of ones argument amongst its premises that was the only meaning of beg the question until late in the th century when the vulgarspecifically the ones working as journalistslearned the phrase and assumed that it meant raise the question youre right about that so i dont take for granted that the truths of morality and religion are rationally deduced i only suppose that if they are then they must be regarded as natural to manie that they fit with and grow from the most excellent part of human nature the part that other natural species dont have i have no objection to bring against this then what are we to think of your former assertions i mean your claims that anything that is natural to man can be found in all men in all nations and ages of the world and that to obtain a genuine view of human nature we must set aside all the effects of upbringing and instruction and look only at the senses appetites and passions that are to be found originally in all mankind and that therefore the notion of a god cant be based in nature because it isnt originally in the mind and isnt the same in all men how do you reconcile these opening statements of yours with your recent concessionsones that the force of truth seems to have extorted from you tell me euphranor isnt truth a single uniform invariable thing and if it is isnt the existence of the many different and mutually inconsistent notions that men have of god and duty a plain proof there is no truth in them i freely grant that truth is constant and uniform so that two opinions that contradict one another cant both be true but it doesnt follow that they are both false when there are conflicting opinions about the same thing the one if there is one that is grounded on clear and evident reasons should be regarded as true and others accepted only to the extent that they are consistent with that privileged one reason is the same at all times and places and when it is used properly it will lead to the same conclusions two thousand years ago socrates seems to have reasoned himself into the same notion of a god that is entertained by the philosophers of our days if youll allow someone who isnt a freethinker to be called philosopher and consider confuciuss remark that a man should be on guard in his youth against lust in manhood against quarrelsomeness and in old age against greedthis morality is as current in europe as in china but when opinions differ that shows that there is uncertainty so it would be good if all men thought the same way what do you think to be the cause of a lunar eclipse the earths coming between the sun and moon making a shadow on the moon are you sure of this certainly are all mankind agreed in this truth by no means ignorant and barbarous people give different ridiculous explanations for this phenomenon so it seems that there are different opinions about the nature of an eclipse there are yet one of these opinions is true it is thus when there are conflicting opinions about something it may still be the case that the thing exists and one of the opinions about it is true i accept that well you argued from the variety of opinions about gods nature to the falsity of the opinion that he exists and now it seems that this argument is not conclusive and i dont see either how you can infer the falsity of any moral or religious tenet from mens conflicting opinions on the same subject isnt arguing like that on a par with arguing that no historical account of a matter of fact can be true if reports of it conflict with one another or arguing that because the various schools of philosophy maintain different opinions none of them can be in the rightnot even the minute philosophers during this conversation lysicles seemed uneasy like someone who profoundly wanted there to be no god alciphron he said i think you are sitting tamely on the sidelines while euphranor undermines the foundation of our tenets dont be afraid replied a skillful player of a game sometimes ruins his adversary by giving him some advantage at first i am glad he said turning to euphranor that youre willing to argue and make your appeals to reason for my part i shant be afraid to follow wherever reason leads so let me say this openly i freely concede the points you have been contending for i dont value the success of a few crude notions thrown out in a casual conversation any more than the turks care about the loss of the rubbishinfantry that they position at the front of their armies so as to waste the gunpowder and blunt the swords of their enemies i have kept a good half of my arguments in reserve and i am ready to bring them forward i will undertake to prove i dont doubt your ability to prove alciphron but before i put you to the trouble of any more proofs id like to know whether the notions of your minute philosophy are worth proving i mean whether they are useful and helpful to mankind as to that let me tell you a thing can be useful to one mans views and not to anothers but truth is truth whether or not its useful and it mustnt be evaluated by whether it is convenient for this or that man or sect but isnt the general good of mankind to be regarded as a rule or guide to evaluation of moral truths indeed of all truths that direct or influence the moral actions see note on page of men its not clear to me that that is right i know of course that legislators theologians and politicians have always maintained that it is necessary for the wellbeing of mankind that men should be kept in awe by the slavish notions of religion and morality but even if you are right about what is convenient or helpful how does that prove these moral notions to be true convenience is one thing and truth is another so a real philosopher will set aside all advantages and consider only truth itself tell me alciphron is your real philosopher a wise man or a fool without question hes the wisest of men as between someone who acts with design and someone who acts at random which should we regard as the wiser the one who acts with design see qa note on page well then i whoever acts with design acts for some end ii and a wise man acts for a good end iii and he shows his wisdom in his choice of means to the end he aims at iv and so the more excellent the pursued end is and the more appropriate the chosen means to it are the wiser the person should be thought to be now v a rational agent cant aim at a more excellent end than happiness vi of good things the greater good is most excellent vii the general happiness of mankind is a greater good than the private happiness of one man or of some particular class of men viii so the general happiness of mankind is the most excellent end ix so those who pursue this end by the most appropriate methods should be regarded as the wisest men x a wise man is governed by wise notions rather than foolish ones xi it seems to follow that someone who promotes the general wellbeing of mankind by the proper necessary means is truly wise and acts on wise grounds xii furthermore folly is the opposite of wisdom xii so mightnt we infer that men who try to dislodge principles that have a necessary connection with the general good of mankind are foolish perhaps this might be granted but at the same time i have to say that it is in my power to deny it what you admit the premises so surely you wont deny the conclusion i want to know what the rules are for our debate in this process of question and answer if a man makes a slip is he allowed to recover for if you are on the lookout for every advantage that you can snatch without allowing for surprise or inattention on my part i have to tell you that this is not the way to convince me of your views im not aiming at triumph alciphron all i want is truth so its completely open to you to unravel all that has been said and to correct any slip you have made but then you must point it out clearly otherwise we cant ever arrive at any conclusion i am also sincerely devoted to truth and agree with you on these terms to proceed together in search of it in the course of our present inquiry i think i slipped when i acknowledged that the general happiness of mankind is a greater good than the particular happiness of one man in fact the individual happiness of each man alone constitutes his own entire good the happiness of other men is not a part of my happiness so from my standpoint it isnt a goodi mean a true natural good so it cant be a reasonable end for me to aim at because no wise man will pursue an end that doesnt concern him i am talking about true natural ends not the ends one might announce as political pretences this is the voice of naturethe fountain source and pattern of all that is good and wise so would you like to follow nature and accept her as a guide and as a pattern for you to imitate i want that more than anything where do you get this respect for nature from from the excellence of its productions for example you say that there is usefulness and excellence in a plant because its many parts are connected and fitted to each other in such a way as to protect and nourish the whole plant make the individual grow and propagate the species and also because we get pleasure and benefit from itgrapes from a vine shade or timber from an oak just so similarly dont you infer the excellence of animal bodies from observing the structure and fitness of their many parts which enables the parts to work together for the wellbeing of each other as well as of the whole animal dont you also notice a natural union and cooperation between animals of the same species and that even animals of different species have certain qualities and instincts through which they contribute to the exercise nourishment and delight of each other even inanimate inorganic materials seem to have an excellence relative to each other why would water be excellent if it didnt cause herbs and vegetables to spring from the earth and put forth flowers and fruit and what would become of the beauty of the earth if it werent warmed by the sun moistened by water and fanned by air note the four elements of ancient greek philosophy throughout the whole system of the visible and natural world dont you see a mutual connection and correspondence of parts and isnt that the basis for your idea of the perfection and order and beauty of nature i accept all this now didnt the stoics who were no more bigots than you are sayand didnt you say a few minutes ago that this pattern of natural order is one that rational agents ought to imitate i dont deny that this is true so oughtnt we infer the same union order and regularity in the moral world that we see in the natural world we ought shouldnt it seem to follow from this that reasonable creatures were made for one another and consequently that a man who wants live according to nature ought to consider himself not as an independent individual whose happiness is unconnected with the happiness of others but rather as the part of a whole for whose common good he ought work together with the other parts ie other men supposing this to be true what then wont it follow that a wise man should consider and pursue his own private good in the light of and in combination the good of other menyou granted this point but later said that that was a slip indeed the point doesnt need a fancy argument by me because it has always been seen to be clearly proved by how we feel for one anothers pain and pleasure and by the mutual affections by which mankind are knit together and because it was the constant doctrine of those who were thought the wisest and most thoughtful men among the ancientsplatonists aristotelians and stoicsnot to mention christians whom you pronounce to be an unthinking prejudiced sort of people i shant dispute this point with you well then since we are in agreement up to here shouldnt it seem to follow from the premises that if the beliefs in a god a future state and moral duties are necessarily connected with the wellbeing of mankind then those beliefs are the only wise right and genuine sources of human conduct you have been led to this conclusion by your own concessions and by the analogy of nature ie by the thesis that human conduct ought to fall into patterns that natural events do fall into i have been drawn into it step by step through many preliminaries and i cant now remember them all clearly but i would point out that you rely on the thesis that those religious and moral principles are necessarily connected with the wellbeing of mankindand thats something that you havent proved and i havent granted berkeleys text like this version of it leaves unclear what direction of necessary connection in question either a the beliefs in god etc inevitably contribute to human wellbeing or b without them human wellbeing is impossible i think its a great big fundamental prejudice and if i had time i could show you that thats what it is but its late now shall we put off this subject till tomorrow with that we put an end to our conversation for that evening second dialogue tuesday in the original work though not in this version this dialogue is the secondtolongest of the set its not very interesting philosophically and a connected fact in it the freethinking side is upheld only by lysicles with alciphron silent throughout next morning alciphron and lysicles said that the weather was so fine that they would like to spend the day outside having a picnic meal under a shade in some pleasant part of the countryside so we went to a nearby beach and walked on the sands until the sun became too hot to be comfortable we then went in among the trees and sat down and immediately lysicles addressed himself to im now ready to make good on my undertaking to show there is nothing in the necessary connection that some men imagine there to be between the principles you are defending and the public good if the question were to be decided by the authority of legislators or philosophers of course it would go against us thats because those men generally take it for granted that vice is harmful to the public and that the only way to keep men from vice is through their fear of god and their sense of an afterlife from which they infer that the belief in such things is necessary to the wellbeing of mankind this false notion has held sway for centuries and has done an infinite amount of mischief it has been the real cause of religions being established within states and of the way laws and magistrates have protected and encouraged the clergy and their superstitions even some of the wisest ancient philosophersones who agreed with our sect in denying the existence of a god and the immortality of the soulwere weak enough to accept the common prejudice that vice is hurtful to human societies but england has recently produced great philosophers who have undeceived the world and conclusively shown that private vices are public benefits this was the subtitle of mandevilles notorious fable of the bees lysicles will now devote about a page to presenting arguments taken from mandeville it wasnt until now that this discovery was made and our sect of freethinkers has the glory of it back to sarcasm it may be that some men with fine intellects did in former ages have a glimpse of this important truth but probably they lived at ignorant times and in bigoted countries that werent ripe for such a discovery men of few talents and short sight being able to see no further than one link along a chain of consequences are shocked at small evils that come with vice but those who can take in more and look along a lengthy series of events can see thousands of examples of happiness resulting from vice and of good growing out of evil i shant trouble you with authoritative writers or elaborate arguments lets just look at some plain matters of fact take each particular vice and track it through all its effects and consequences and you clearly see the advantage it brings to the public drunkenness for instance is a harmful vice according to your sober moralists but thats because they didnt take into account the good effects that flow from it lysicles goes on to describe some of these for vulgar drunkenness income from a tax on malt and employment for many different kinds of workers in the beer industry for drunkenness caused by wine and spirits admittedly that sends money into foreign countries but it creates employment in the home countryvastly increased and proliferated by the need for ships then there are all the trades involved in making things that ships export to pay for the wine and spirits and every trade is supported by and supports yet further trades so that theres no end to the good that comes from drunkenness then equally stupidly your halfwitted folk are given to condemning gaming here playing cards for money on the face of it cardplaying seems to be a very idle and useless occupation but if you dig down below the face of it youll see that this idle pastime employs the cardmaker who provides work for the papermills which support the poor man who collects discarded rags not to mention the workers who are employed in building and equipping those mills look still deeper and youll find that candles to light the games and the hiring of sedanchairs to take the players to the game employ the industrious and the poor in this way they are helped by cardsharpers and gentlemen who wouldnt give a penny in charity you may object that many gentlemen and ladies are ruined by gaming but if you do you arent taking into account that what one man loses another gets so that as many are enriched as are ruined money changes hands thats what the life of business and commerce consists inthe circulation of money when money is spent the public doesnt care who spends it suppose an upperclass fool is cheated by a very lowbred fellow who has more brainswhat harm does this do to the public poverty is relieved ingenuity is rewarded the money stays at home you may object that a man made poor by gaming may resort to some desperate conduct that will be hurtful to the public lysicles goes on to speak of the good a highwayman can do mainly by spending extravagantly during his short and merry life but also through the reward that may go to a poor family that turns him in to the police my topic was gaming which smoothly led me to the advantages of highway robbery oh the beautiful and neverenoughadmired connection of vices it would take too long to show how they all hang together and what an infinite amount of good arises from each of them ill add just a few words now on a favourite vice then ill leave you to work out the rest of the story for yourselfive shown you how consider a poor girl who doesnt have what you would call an honest halfcrown a week to spend she has the good luck to become someones kept mistress and immediately she employs milliners laundresses dressers fabricsellers and a number of other trades all to the benefit of her country we could go on for ever tracking every particular vice through its consequences and effects showing the vast advantage they all bring to the public the true springs that drive the great machine of commerce and make the state flourish have been little understood until now your moralists and theologians have long been corrupting the genuine sense of mankind filling mens heads with absurd principlesso long and so absurd that few men now can look at life with an unprejudiced eye and fewer still have the talents and intelligence to pursue a long chain of consequences relations and dependences which is what you must do if you want to form a sound and complete notion of the public welfare oh said euphranor who had listened to this speech very attentively you are the very man i wanted lysicles eloquent and able wellinformed about the principles of your sect and willing to impart them to others tell me is it easy to get these principles accepted in the world it is easy among very able men and people of fashion though youll sometimes meet with strong prejudices against them in people of the middle sort an effect of ordinary talents and low breeding id be surprised if men were not shocked at such surprising notions so contrary to all laws education and religion theyd have been even more shocked if it hadnt been for the skillful writing style of our philosophers knowing that most men are influenced by names rather than by things they have introduced a certain cleanedup way of speaking which lessens much of the revulsion and prejudice against vice explain this for me well in our dialect an immoral man is a man of pleasure a cardsharper is one who plays the whole game an adulterous lady is said to have an affair an adulterous gentleman is said to be gallant a rogue in business is said to be one who knows the world by this means we have no such things as drunkards womanisers whores or rogues in the fashionable world whose inhabitants can enjoy their vices without having nasty labels attached to them so it seems that vice is a fine thing with an ugly name be assured it is plato was afraid that young people might be corrupted by the myths that represent the gods as vicious according to you it seems that attitude was an effect of his weakness and ignorance it was take my word for it yet plato had kept good company and lived in a court and cicero who knew the world well had a deep respect for him plato and cicero may have looked good in ancient athens or rome but if they returned to life today they would be regarded as underbred pedants at most coffeehouses in london there are several able men who could convince plato and cicero that they knew nothing about morals and politicsthe very topics that they are valued so much for not the most sharpwitted of men lysicles hasnt picked up the note of sarcastic scorn in what crito has just said i know ever so many shrewd men both in royal court circles and in the business parts of the city who have five times platos sense and dont care in the slightest what notion their sons have of god or virtue i can illustrate this doctrine of lysicles by two examples that will make you perceive its force the examples are fictional in the first a minute philosopher turns his son into a member of that sect which leads to the sons murdering him and then squandering his estate until he goes bankrupt in the second a minute philosopher converts his wife to his way of thinking he rightly thinks this will stop her from giving to charity and this leads her to adopt an extravagant way of life including playing cards for high stakes thus using up most of her husbands wealth in each case crito recites the mandevillean public benefits of the behaviour in question the murderous sons recklessness spreads his inherited wealth more widely than his miserly father ever would have done the extravagant wife through her gaming transferred a considerable share of her husbands fortune to a number of sharpwitted men who needed it more and circulated it faster than her husband would have done crito maintained a straight face while he told these stories but i couldnt help smiling which lysicles noticed superficial minds he said may find something to ridicule in these accounts but anyone who is really competent in rational thinking must see that a wise commonwealth ought to encourage maxims that bring benefit to everyone and do harm only to particular private persons or families speaking for myself said euphranor i declare that im dazzled and bewildered rather than convinced by your reasoning as you yourself pointed out it takes a great deal of thought to grasp the connections of many distant points soplease put up with my slowness and allow me to take to pieces something that is too big to be taken in all at once and when i cant match your speed allow me to follow you step by step as fast as i can that is reasonable its not everyone who can all in one swoop take in a long chain of argument see qa note on page i your various arguments seem to centre on this vice circulates money and promotes industry which causes a people to flourish ii and vice produces this effect by causing extravagant consumption which is the most beneficial to the manufacturers giving them a quick demand and high price iii so you think that a drunkard because he drinks more than other men brings more benefit to the brewer and the vintner than other men do iv a healthy man drinks more than a sick man v a sober man is healthier than a drunkard so vi a sober man in good health may drink more than a drunkard when he is sick vii a man will consume more meat and drink in a long life than in a short one viii so a sober healthy man may in a long life circulate more money by eating and drinking than a glutton or drunkard circulates in a short life what of it well it seems that the sober healthy man may be more beneficial to the publici mean beneficial through how he eats and drinksthan the glutton or the drunkard is youll never get me to agree that temperance is the way to promote drinking but you will agree that sickness lessens drinking and that death puts an end to it the same argument will hold so far as i can see for every vice that harms mens health and shortens their lives and if that is so the public benefits of vice wont be so sure granted some makers or traders might be as well encouraged by the sober men as the vicious what about the ones whose livelihood depends entirely on vice and vanity if there are people like that couldnt they be employed in some other way without loss to the public tell me lysicles is there anything in the nature of vice in itself that makes it a public blessing or is it only the consumption it causes i have already shown how it benefits the nation by the consumption of things the nation manufactures and you have agreed that a long and healthy life consumes more than a short and sickly one and you wont deny that many consume more than one you do the math which is more likely to promote the industry of his countrymen a virtuous married man with healthy children of his own who also feeds and clothes the orphans in his neighbourhood or a fashionable looseliving man about town doesnt innocently spent money circulate as well as money spent on vice and if it does so doesnt your line of thought imply that innocent activities benefit the public as much as vicious ones what i have proved i proved clearly and nothing more needs to be said about it i cant see that you have proved anything unless you can show that it is impossible to spend a fortune innocently id have thought that the public welfare of a nation consists in the number and good condition of its inhabitants have you anything to object to this i think not which would contribute more to this end employing men in outdoor manly exercise or employing them in sedentary business within doors the former i suppose doesnt it seem to follow that building gardening and agriculture would employ men more usefully to the public than if tailors barbers perfumers distillers and the like were multiplied agreed but this goes against you because what incites men to build and plant is vanity and vanity is a vice but if a man were to build and plant meaning to employ people to build and plant for his convenience or pleasure in proportion to his fortune without foolish ostentation and without exaggerating the value of his house and garden they wouldnt be the effect of vice and how do you know that this cant happen the economic argument about whether and to what extent private vices are public benefits continues through many not very interesting pages with lysicles continuing to be stubborn and continuing not to understand the spirit in which crito extravagantly supports the minute philosophers positioneg talking of all the good that had been done by the fire in london and the injustice done to a freethinker who in a purely principled way murdered his father and was hanged for it they discuss a little the question of whether it is dangerous to publish such views the answer being that it is safe on the antireligious side of the minutephilosophy doctrine less so on the provice legal and political side lysicles says that he wants the whole governmental and legal structure overhauled in the light of the provice principles that freethinkers have discovered then you are it seems in favour of bringing about a thorough reformation as for what is commonly called the reformation i could never see how the world was the better for it protestantism is much the same as popery except for being more prudish and disagreeable a noted writer of ours calculates that the benefit of hooped petticoats is nearly equal to the benefit of the reformation but i think he is flattering it coming back to your question thorough reformation is thorough liberty leave nature absolutely free to work her own way and all will be well thats what we aim at our principles wont let us settle for less crito is a zealous protestant and when he heard lysicles passing jab at the reformation he couldnt refrain from joining in speaking his own mind rather than parodying the freethinkers the worst effect of the reformation he said was that it rescued wicked men from a darkness that had kept them in awe this has turned out to be holding out light to robbers and murderers and the light brought by the reformation may have done harm in another way too namely by encouraging freethinking it didnt have to do that light in itself is good and the light that shows a man the folly of popish superstition might also show him the truth of protestant religion and the madness of atheism but some people have used the light only to see the evils on one side roman catholicism and to run blindly into the arms of the worse evils of the opposite extreme atheism that was to make the best of things produce evil in the way that you show the worst things producing goodnamely accidentally or indirectly lysicles was a little disconcerted by critos emphatic tone but after a short pause he replied briskly that not everyone has the talent to think about the public good true said euphranor i also think that not everyone can frame a notion of the public good much less make good judgments about how to promote it but you lysicles who are a master of this subject please tell me doesnt the public good of a nation imply the particular good of its individuals it does and doesnt the good or happiness of a man consist in his having both soul and body sound and in good condition enjoying the things that their natures require and free from things that are odious or hurtful to them i dont deny that all this is true well it seems worthwhile to consider whether the regular decent life of a virtuous man mightnt be as conducive to this as the mad sallies of intemperance and debauchery ill admit that without the aid of vice a nation may merely survive be kept alive but it cant possibly flourish to get money and goods into rapid circulation in a state there must be extravagant and irregular motions in the appetites and passions the more people a nation contains and the happier they are the more that nation can be said to flourish i think we are agreed on this we are so you concede that riches are not an ultimate end but should be considered only as a means to happiness i do it seems that means cant be useful unless we know what the end is and how to apply the means to it it seems so doesnt it follow that in order to make a nation flourish it isnt enough to make it wealthy without knowing what the true end and happiness of mankind is and how to apply wealth towards achieving that end to the extent that these points are known and practised i think the nation would be likely to flourish but for a people who dont know or practise them gaining riches seems to me on a par with letting a sick man have plenty of food and drink which it will harm him to consume this is just sophistry it is arguing without persuading look into how in general people live their lives examine the pursuits of men have a due respect for the peoples ways of interacting and getting on with one another and youll soon be convinced that a nation can be made flourishing and happy through richesjust through riches give them wealth and they will make themselves happy without that political invention that trick of governments and philosophers called virtue in the next few pages which are not philosophically very nourishing the main topics of discussion are these whether virtue is a trick of governments which segment of the population should be listened to with respect lysicles responds to euphranors suggestion of country gentlemen and farmers and the better sort of tradesmen with blundering rudeness if people in general are so open to prejudice mightnt there be some prejudice in the minute philosophers position bodily health is a real objective state which can be driven up or down by what is done to the body why not an analogous view of spiritual or mental health here is how this last theme develops cant we suppose that there is such a state as a healthy constitution of the soulthe state it is in when its notions are right its judgments true its will regular its passions and appetites kept moderate and directed to the right objects and the man whose mind is so constituted isnt he properly called virtuous and shouldnt every good man try to produce this healthy disposition in the minds of his countrymen if these things have any appearance of truth as they seem to me to have it isnt so obvious that virtue is a mere whim or fashion or trick as you choose to say it is you took me by surprise when you said this i must admit given the conversation we had about this yesterday evening if you call that back to your mind it might perhaps save both of us some trouble frankly euphranor i admit to having forgotten everything you said about virtue duty and all that the points you made were of an airy notional nature which made them apt to vanish without leaving any trace in a mind that is accustomed to receiving impression only from realities at this euphranor looked at crito and me and said smiling i have been getting out of line my role was to learn and his to instruct then we have several pages about happiness and especially pleasure human pleasures versus animal ones higher pleasures versus lower ones transient pleasures versus more lasting ones and so on euphranor alludes to the sincerity the intensity and the duration of pleasures at one point lysicles rhapsodizes about the pleasures of cardplaying people of fashion couldnt live without cards they provide the most delightful way of passing an evening for an assemblage of gentlemen and ladies who otherwise wouldnt know what to say or do with themselves and a pack of cards doesnt merely give them something to do when they are together it also draws them together squaredancing gives them a pleasure to look forward to during the dull hours of the day they reflect on it with delight and it is something to talk about when it is over so the chief amusement of these people of fashion is an activity that any manual labourer can engage in being as well qualified to get pleasure from cards as a peer is it looks as though life is a drag for these people of fashion and that their fortunes arent doing them much good i can well imagine that when people of a certain sort are brought together they would prefer doing anything to the boredom of their own conversation but it isnt easy to think that theres any great pleasure in this play here playing cards for money is a serious amusement that brings relief to a man of pleasure after the more lively and affecting enjoyments of sense it kills time better than anything and is a most admirable antidote to redirect or prevent thoughts that might otherwise prey on the mind i can easily see that no man on earth ought to value antidotes for irritable boredom more than a man of fashion and pleasure an ancient sage speaking of someone of that sort says he is made wretched by disappointments and appetites and if this was true of the greeks who lived in the sun and had so much spirit im inclined to think its even truer of our modern englishmen theres something in our climate and our makeup that makes it especially true of us that idleness its own punishment an uneducated fine gentleman pays for his momentary pleasures with long and cruel intervals of being bored and out of sorts to relieve these he is driven into sensual excesses which further depress his spirits his low condition while creating a greater need for pleasures lessens his ability to enjoy them an englishmans cast of mind makes him the most unsuccessful rake in the world a rakea term that well meet several times moreis a man whose way of life is stylish and fashionable but also promiscuous and dissolute he is in aristotles phrase at odds with himself he isnt brute enough to enjoy his appetites or man enough to govern them he knows and feels that what he pursues is not his true good and when he looks inwards all he finds is the misery that his habitual sluggishness and idleness wont allow him to remedy eventually having grown odious to himself and hating his own company he joins any idle group that he can not in the hope of pleasure but merely to relieve the pain of his own mind listless and uneasy in the present he has no delight in reflecting on what is past or in the prospect of anything to come when after a wretched lifetime of vanity and woe his animal nature is worn to the stumps this man of pleasure alternates between wanting death and dreading it he is sick of living without ever having tried or known the true life of man ironically its just as well that this sort of life which is of so little benefit to its owner brings so much benefit to the public then some discussion of courage and of why there arent more disillusioned minute philosophers who commit suicide critos answer because they arent sure they are right about god and the afterlife then socrates who was no country parson suspected that your men of pleasure were such ie were men of pleasure through ignorance ignorance of what of the art of computing calculating as it were mathematically he thought that rakes cant do their sums and that because of this lack in their intellects they make wrong judgments about pleasure where their happiness depends on their making right ones i dont understand you do you agree that the senses perceive only sensible things i do and the senses perceive only things that are present i accept that too so pleasures of the understanding and future pleasures arent to be judged by the senses they are not so people who judge pleasures by the senses may find themselves mistaken at the bottom line he quotes some lines from the latin satirical poet persius about someone ending up with his joints ruined by gout so that his limbs are like brittle beechtree branches lamenting the way he has spent his life and depressed at the thought of the kind of life that lies ahead of him then to get the computation right shouldnt you consider all the faculties and all the kinds of pleasure taking the future into account as well as the present and rating them all according to their true value the epicureans held that a pleasure that produces a greater pain or that hinders a greater pleasure should be regarded as a pain and that a pain that produces a greater pleasure or prevents a greater pain is to be accounted a pleasure thus if we are to make a true estimate of pleasurethat great spring of action from which the conduct of life gets its directionwe have to compute intellectual pleasures and future ones as well as sensible pleasures and present ones and in estimating each particular pleasure we have to take into account all the pains and evils all the disgust remorse and shame that come with it and we ought to take account of the kind as well as the quantity of each pleasure let a freethinker merely consider how little human pleasure consists in actual sensation and how much in prospect then let him then compare the prospect of a virtuous believer with that of an unbelieving rake euphranor briefly joins in and lysicles responds sharply that the freethinkers calculate that what you call a good christian must be unfit for the worlds affairs thus while you compute yourselves out of pleasure others compute you out of business then further conversation about the personal characters of minute philosophers and then about how they spread their wordthe role of writers in this the effects on the young of freethinking ideassavage anecdotes about this by crito then wouldnt there always be rakes and rogues even if we didnt make them believe me the world always was and always will be the same as long as men are men i deny that the world is always the same human nature to use alciphrons comparison is like land better or worse depending on how it is managed and what seeds or principles are sown in it i agree there might be bad men through the force of corrupt appetites and unruly passions even if nobody accepted your tenets but when to the force of appetite and passion men add the force of opinion and are wicked on principle there will be more men who are wicked and they will be more incurably and outrageously wicked the error of a lively rake lies in his passions and may be reformed but the dry rogue who sets himself up in judgments is incorrigible more discussion of the characters of minute philosophers their place in history and other related topics then we have a maxim namely that each should take care of oneie should take care of himself alas lysicles you wrong your own character you minute philosophers want to get the world and yourselves to accept you as cunning selfinterested men but can anything be more disinterested not self interested than to give up all concern with the theoretical pursuit of truth can anything be less cunning than to publish your discoveries to the world teach others to play the whole game and arm mankind against yourselves re play the whole game see lysicles speech well in our dialect on page to you folk who are fired with love of truth and love of liberty and grasping the whole extent of nature i suggest that to those loves you add love of your country forgive me for introducing such a lowdown thought i would urge you to be cautious in the same way that all other discoverers projectors and makers of experiments are they never risk everything on the first trial wouldnt it be prudent to try the success of your principles on a small model in some remote corner of the earth for instance set up a colony of atheists in monomotapa in southern africa and see how it prospers before you proceed any further at home halfadozen shiploads of minute philosophers could easily be spared for such a good plan in the meantime you gentlemen who have discovered that theres nothing to be hoped or feared in an afterlife that conscience is a nagging pest that the bands of government and the cement of human society are rotten things that can be dissolved and crumbled into nothing by the arguments of any minute philosopher be so good as to keep these sublime discoveries to yourselves and allow all the rest of us to continue in the beliefs and ways of thinking established by the laws of our country speaking seriously i do wish you would try your experiments among the hottentots or turks we think well of the hottentots believing them to be an unprejudiced people but im afraid their diet and customs wouldnt agree with our philosophers as for the turks they are bigots who have a notion of god and a respect for jesus christ i doubt if it would be safe to venture among them then make your experiment in some other christian country we think that all other christian nations are much under the power of prejudice even our neighbours the dutch are too much prejudiced in favour of their religion which their law has established for a prudent man to attempt innovations under their government on the whole it seems that no country can offer as much security and prospect of success for our schemes as england does not to mention the fact that we have already made good progress the right way to start this experiment was to wipe out the prejudices of individual persons we have carried on this work for many years working hard and skillfully at first secretly as our principles gained acceptance and as our numbers grew we gradually revealed ourselves and our opinions and i neednt tell you where we have now come to we have grubbed and weeded and cleared human nature so thoroughly that before long youll see natural and sound ideas sprout up by themselves without any labouring or teaching crito reports the view of a wise man whom he doesnt name that the worst and most unwholesome weed was this same minute philosophy from there he moves to recounting a fable about a contest in hell to select the devil who could do most harm to humanity the runnerup appeared as gunpowder producing great noise and destruction and fear the winner set up as a pharmacist thus he passed as a friend and a physician through the world disguised himself with sweets and perfumes and drugs made his way into pharmacies and ladies cabinets and under a pretence of helping digestion comforting the spirits and cheering the heart he produced direct contrary effects and quietly and invisibly pushed great numbers of mankind into a fatal decay ie a decay that was fatal in the sense of being fated inevitable unstoppable he populated hell and the grave so fast that he earned the post of ruler of hell which he still holds those who please may amuse themselves with fables and allegories this is plain english liberty is a good thing and we are the support of liberty it seems to me that liberty and virtue were made for each other if someone wants to enslave his country the best preparation for that is vice and nothing leads to vice so surely as irreligion does i simply cant understand and i have tried how this hostility to religion can be an effect of honest views regarding a just and legal liberty let us examine what good your principles have done who has been the better for the instructions of these minute philosophers let us compare what we are in respect of learning loyalty honesty wealth power and public spirit with what we have been freethinking as it is called has grown amazingly in recent years let us see what has grown up along with it or as a result of it i shant list all the resultant ills that would be a nasty task and on the other side there is the only blessing that the minute philosophy can claim namely luxurythe same blessing that opened up ancient rome to the worlds revenge the same luxury that makes a nation look full and fat when it actually has one foot in the grave you have this wrong our sect think and argue better than anyone about the public good of a state and we have invented here discovered many things that are conducive to the public good but cant yet conveniently be put into practice but the public has received one advantage from the spread of your principles namely the old roman practice of selfmurder this puts an end to all distress stopping miserable people from going on being a burden to the world and to themselves you chose to make some remarks about this custom a little while ago page and to laugh at the irresolution of our freethinkers who couldnt make up their minds to kill themselves but i can tell you as a matter of fact that they have often recommended it by their example as well as by arguments and that it is solely because of them that this practice useful and magnanimous as it is has been taken out of the hands of lunatics and restored to the status among men of sense that it had in ancient times in whatever light you may look at it this is in fact a solid benefit but the best effect of our principles is the light and truth that they have so visibly spread through the world the number of prejudices errors perplexities and contradictions that we have cleared out of the minds of our fellowsubjects the number of hard words and intricate absurd notions that possessed the minds of men before our philosophers appeared in the world now even women and children have right and sound notions of things what do you say to this crito i say regarding these great advantages of destroying men and notions that i doubt that the public gains as much by the destruction of notions as it loses by the destruction of men speaking for myself i had rather my wife and children all had beliefs with no real thoughts behind them and daily pronounced words without a meaning than that any one of them should cut her throat or leap out of a window the public doesnt care much about errors and nonsense as such it is less concerned with whether a notion is metaphysically true than with whether it will tend to produce good or evil truth itself is valued by the public because it does have an influence and is felt in the course of life but the minute philosophers are not the men to whom we owe most for discoveries of that kind im making this point on the basis that your notions are in fact true and in fact i dont think they are candidly i think they are not only harmful but also false the tendency of your opinions is so bad that no good man can endure them and your arguments for them are so weak that no wise man will accept them hasnt it been provedas clear as the midday sunthat since the spreading of our principles the more smoothly civilised sort of men have led much happier lives and have been swimming in pleasure but i dont want to repeat things that i have already proved so ill add just one point our principles bring advantages even to very small children and to women they deliver children from terrors by night and ladies from intensely bored hours by day crito fiercely attacks this saying that we should compute what a liberated lady will give up against what she will get through the minute philosophy and that at the bottom line you shall find that empty giddy gaudy fluttering thing not half so happy as a butterfly or a grasshopper on a summers day similarly for the liberated man ending with this when his sense and appetite fade and he seeks refuge from his conscience in the minute philosophy the real truth about him is that he affects much believes little knows nothing lysicles makes couple of short interventions in the second of them saying that none of this will make our principles less true crito snaps back their truth is not what we are talking about our present topic is the usefulness of your principles and to decide this all we need is to get an overview of them fairly stated and laid side by side there is no god or providence man is as the beasts that perish mans happiness like that of the beasts consists in obeying animal instincts appetites and passions all stings of conscience and sense of guilt are prejudices and errors of upbringing religion is a state trick vice is beneficial to the public the soul of man is corporeal and dissolves like a flame or vapour man is a machine driven according to the laws of motion so he does not act and cant be guilty of anything a wise man evaluates and chooses all his actions in this life on the basis of his own individual selfinterest it seems that these opinions and others like them are the tenets of a minute philosopherwho is himself according to his own principles an organ played on by perceptible objects a ball swatted about by appetites and passions he is so acuteminded that he can maintain all this by skillful reasoning so sharpsighted and penetrating and deep that he can discover that the only true wisdom is the most selfinterested secret cunning to round out this charactersketch this ingenious piece of clockwork having no source of action within itself and denying that it has or can have a single free thought or motion sets itself up as the protector of liberty and argues earnestly for freethinking the moment crito stopped speaking lysicles addressed himself to euphranor and me crito he said has taken a vast amount of trouble but has convinced me of only one solitary thing namely that i havent a hope of convincing him never in my whole life have i met with a man so deeply immersed in prejudice i leave it others to pull him out of the mire but i have better hopes of convincing you speaking for myself i said i can answer that my eyes and ears are always open to conviction i attend to everything that is said and my overall final judgment whether right or wrong will at least be quite impartial crito is bolder than i am undertaking in this way to scold and lecture a philosopher for my part i always find it easier to learn than to teach so ill ask for your help in ridding me of some worries about the practical effects of your opinionsa topic that i havent been able to get on top of though ever so willing when this is done perhaps we still wont tread in exactly the same steps perhaps we wont even walk on the same road but we shant keep coming into direct collision with one another he then presents a set of feeble examples in support of the general thesis that extremes lead to opposite extremes in the natural world and alsohe addsin the civil world where power produces licence and licence produces power bigots make atheists and atheists make bigots the threat is that if the success of the minute philosophy leads to lax government and great licentiousness there will be a reaction taking the country to the opposite extreme of something like what we might call fascism euphranor then launches into another worry that i have about the tendency of your opinions it is than an england cleansed of protestant christianity would create a spiritual vacuum not his phrase that would be filled by many subtle and effective covert missionaries for roman catholicism lysicles replies that the minute philosophers dont prefer any religion to any other and that if roman catholicism became the enforced orthodoxy of england they would all go along with it and what about their minute philosophy oh we should have more than ever of that for we should keep it all to ourselves crito remarks that the minute philosophers tend to make friends of the jesuits ignorantly unaware that the jesuits are subtle and sophisticated enough to make dupes of the minute philosophers then here crito paused and fixed his eyes on alciphron who during this whole conversation had sat thoughtful and attentive without saying a word sometimes seeming dissatisfied at what lysicles advanced at other times apparently serene and pleased as though approving some better thought of his own but the day was now far advanced and alciphron proposed to adjourn the argument till the following day then he said i shall put matters on a new foundation and in a light that is so full and clear that i am sure it will give entire satisfaction so we switched to talk about other things ate our picnic meal strolled on the beach and returned to critos home in the cool of the evening third dialogue wednesday the following day as we sat around the teatable in a summer parlour facing the garden alciphron turned down his cup sat back in his chair and said our sect is the only one on earth that has the special privilege of not being tied down by any principles while other philosophers declare themselves to be committed to certain doctrines ours assert a noble freedomdiffering from one another and often a single philosopher differing from himself among its other advantages this method of proceeding makes us of all men the hardest to refute you may show a particular tenet of ours to be wrong but this affects only those who maintain that thesis and only for as long as they maintain it some freethinkers dogmatize more than others do and on some points more than on others the doctrine of the usefulness of vice is something we are not all agreed on some of us are great admirers of virtue others have problems regarding vice and virtue speaking for myself i think that the doctrine maintained yesterday by lysicles is an ingenious bit of theory but for various reasons im inclined not to accept it and rather to join the virtue side in that debate that puts me in the company of a very small part of our sect but it may be the most thoughtful and praiseworthy part of it anyway after looking into it fairly and very carefully i think that we ought to prefer virtue to vice and that in doing so we would be doing good things for the public and for the reputation of our philosophers so you should know that a number of freethinkersmen who havent a grain of religion in their makeupare men of the most scrupulous honour which makes them men of virtue honour is a noble unpolluted source of virtue with absolutely no fear selfinterest or superstition mixed in with it it has all the advantages of religion with none of the drawbacks see qa note on page i so honour is the source of virtue ii a thing cant be the source of itself iii so the source has to be distinguished from whatever it is the source of iv so honour is one thing and virtue is another i agree virtuous actions are the effect and honour is their source or cause tell me now what the role of honour is in this is honour the will that produces the virtuous actions as their efficient cause or the final cause for which they are produced or right reason that governs and controls them or what the actions are about or do you use honour to stand for a faculty or appetite each of these is supposed to be in one way or another a source of human actions honour is none of them then please give me some notion or definition of it alciphron thought for a while and then answered that he defined honour to be a principle of virtuous actions euphranor replied as i understand it the word principle has several senses a sometimes by principles we mean the parts of which a whole is composed and into which it can be resolved or analysed its in this sense that the elements are called principles of compound bodies and words and syllables and letters are the principles of speech b sometimes by principle we mean a small individual seed the growth or gradual unfolding of which produces an organic body animal or vegetable in its proper size and shape c principles in other contexts are supposed to be certain fundamental theorems in arts and sciences in religion and politics now when you say honour is a principle of virtue in which if any of these sense are you using principle alciphron replied that he didnt mean it in any of those senses and that he defined honour to be a certain ardour or enthusiasm that glowed in the breast of a gallant man at that time enthusiasm tended to mean something close to fanaticism which sometimes replaces it in this version in the present context however it is safer to let the word stand euphranor remarked that it is always legitimate to put a definition in place of the term defined is this allowed he asked it is then cant we say that a man of honour is an ardent or heated man or an enthusiast alciphron replied that theres no point in such exactness that pedants may dispute and define but they can never reach the high sense of honour that distinguishes the fine gentleman this honour he said was a thing to be felt rather than explained crito seeing that alciphron couldnt bear being pressed any further on that matter and wanting to give some satisfaction to euphranor said that he wouldnt undertake to explain such a delicate matter but that he would repeat to them part of a conversation he once heard between a minute philosopher and a christian on the same subject the reported dialogue which is quite short represents the freethinkers honour as a disgracefully meagre affair pretty much limited to paying ones gambling debts and engaging in duels when challenged i dont want the opinion of someone of whom i know nothing tell me your own judgment about what honour is based on your own observations of men of honour well from everything that i have heard or seen i could never find that honourconsidered as an actionstimulus distinct from conscience religion reason and virtuewas anything but an empty name i really do think that those who base their conduct on the notion of honour have less virtue than other men and that what they seem to have as their substitute for virtue is derived either from the fashion of the day or from a conscience that has without their knowing it retained faint traces of the religious principles that were drummed into them in their childhood these two principles sources seem to account for everything that in those gentlemen men of fashion who are full of animal life are blustering braggarts when it comes to morality they would blush to let anyone think that they are afraid of conscience they go on about honour and want to be known as men of honour rather than as conscientious or honest men but so far as i can see this shiny glow of honour with nothing of conscience or religion beneath it to give it life and substance is no better than a meteor or sunset cloud i had a confused idea that honour had a lot to do with truth and that men of honour were the greatest enemies of all hypocrisy falsehood and disguise quite the contrary an unbeliever who thinks he has the most scrupulous honour without having the least grain of faith or religion will pretend to be a christiantake any test join in any act of worship kneel pray receive the sacramentall to serve his own selfinterest he wont feel that his honour is at stake when he solemnly declares and promises in the face of god and the world that he will love his wife and forsaking all others keep only to her while having not the faintest intention of keeping any part of his vowas he shows to everyone as soon as he gets her and her money in his power we had a notion here in the country that calling a man of honour a liar was the nastiest thing one could do and a very risky thing to do that is very true such a man doesnt mind lying but he hates to be called a liar alciphron having peacefully heard all this said the term freethinker covers men of very different sorts and sentiments so that freethinkers cant be said strictly to constitute a single sect with a particular system of positive and distinct opinions we do indeed all agree on certain points of unbelief certain negative principles and this agreement does in a way bring us together under the common idea of one sect but those negative principles as they take root in men who differ in age temperament and upbringing produce a wide variety of tendencies opinions and characters dont think that our greatest strength lies in the libertines and mere men of honour who constitute the majority of us no we have among us philosophers of a very different type enquiring thinkers who are governed not by such crude things as sense and custom but by highly principled virtue and elevated moralsand the less religious they are the more virtuous an unbeliever is the best qualified person for virtue of the high and disinterested not self interested kind because it is a lowdown and selfish thing to be virtuous through fear or hope as believers are the notion of a god who maintains a future state of rewards and punishments may indeed tempt or scare cowardly men into behaviour that is contrary to the natural tendency of their souls but it will never produce genuine virtue to get to the bottom of things to analyse virtue into its ultimate elements and settle a scheme of morals on its true basis you have to grasp that an idea of beauty is natural to the mind of man all men want beauty they are pleased and delighted with it for its own sake purely from an instinct of nature a man doesnt need arguments to make him identify and approve what is beautiful it strikes him at first sight and attracts him without a reason and just as this beauty is found in the physical features of material things so also theres a different though analogous kind of beautyan order a symmetry a handsomenessin the moral world and just as the eye perceives one sort of beauty so does the mind by a certain interior sense perceive the other sort and this sense talent or faculty is always sharpest and purest in the noblest minds just as we unhesitatingly pronounce a dress to be fine or a physical movement graceful we can with the same free untutored judgment tell straight off whether someones behaviour is beautiful to detect and enjoy this kind of beauty you need a delicate and fine taste but when someone has this natural taste thats all he needs he has no need for anything else as a principle to convince him of the value of beauty or as a motive to induce him to love virtue and every rational creature has something of this taste or sense though in varying degrees all rational beings are by nature social they are drawn towards one another by natural affections they unite into families clubs parties and commonwealths by mutual sympathy just as the various parts of our body guided by the sensitive soul contribute to our animal functions and are connected to make one whole organism so also the various parts of these rational systems guided by this moral or interior sense are held together have a fellow feeling do support and protect each other and jointly cooperate towards a single end thats the source of our joy in society our inclination towards doing good to our kind the approval and delight we have when we see other mens virtuous deeds or think back on our own by thinking about the fitness and order of the parts of a moral system operating regularly and held together by benevolent affections the mind of man achieves the highest notion of beauty excellence and perfection held by this sublime idea our philosophers infinitely despise and pity anyone who proposes or accepts any other motive to virtue selfinterest is a lowdown and ungenerous thing destroying the merit of virtue and falsehood of every kind is inconsistent with the genuine spirit of philosophy so your love for moral beauty and your passion for truth as such wont let you patiently endure those fraudulent impositions upon mankind god the immortality of the soul and rewards and punishments in an afterlife which purport to promote virtue but really destroy it destroy true virtue and at the same time contradict and belittle your noble theories thus tending to disturb and agitate mens minds and fill them with doomed hopes and empty terrors mens first thoughts and natural notions are the best in moral matters mankind doesnt need to be preached or reasoned or frightened into virtue which is such a natural and congenial thing for every human soul and if this is the caseas it certainly isit follows that all societys aims are secured without religion and that an unbeliever offers promise of being the most virtuous man in a true sublime and heroic sense while you say these things alciphron i feel a state of my soul like the trembling of one lute when the unison strings of another are plucked doubtless there is a beauty of the mind a charm in virtue a symmetry and proportion in the moral world the ancients knew this moral beauty by the name of honestum if we want to know what its force and influence are it may be worthwhile to inquire how it was understood and depicted by those who first considered it and gave it a name honestum according to aristotle is what is praiseworthy according to plato it is what is pleasant or profitablemeaning pleasant to a reasonable mind and profitable to its true interest euphranor gives the key words here in greek as well as in english or in one case honestum latin see qa note on page i when we think of an action as praiseworthy our thought goes beyond the bare action itself and takes in the opinion of others concerning it ii so this isnt a sufficient basis or source of virtue for a man to act on in a case where he thinks that his conduct cant be observed by any other thinking being iii when a man does something because he finds it pleasant or profitable we have to think that hell refrain from doing itor even do its oppositeif that has a prospect of greater pleasure or profit iv so it follows from this that the beauty of virtue in either aristotles or platos sense is not sufficient to get sensual and worldlyminded men to act virtuously v so it follows that hope of reward and fear of punishment are extremely useful in getting the balance of pleasant and profitable to swing down on the side of virtue thus bringing much benefit to human society alciphron appealed gentlemen you are witnesses of this unfair proceeding of euphranors who argues against us on the basis of platos and aristotles accounts of the beauty of virtue accounts that have nothing to do with our views the philosophers of our sect rise above all praise pleasure and selfinterest when they are captured and bowled over by the sublime idea of the beauty of virtue i apologise replied euphranor for supposing that todays minute philosophers think like those ancient sages but tell me alciphron since you dont adopt platos or aristotles account of it what do you understand the beauty of virtue to be define it explain it make me understand your meaning that so we can argue about the same thing if we dont do that well never reach a conclusion some things are better understood by definitions and descriptions but i have always observed that those who do least well concerning the beauty of virtue are those who try to define explain and dispute about it moral beauty is so unique and abstract so subtle fine and fleeting that it doesnt survive being handled and inspected like a jug or a boot so youll have to allow me my philosophic liberty to take my stand within the general and indefinite sense rather than entering into a precise and detailed account of this beauty possibly losing sight of it and also possibly giving you leverage for criticizing and inferring and raising doubts queries and difficulties about something thats as clear as the sun when nobody reasons upon it are you then saying alciphron that the notion of moral beauty is clearest when it is not thought about i say that its something to be felt rather than understood a certain je ne sais quoi french i dont know what we engage with it not through our conceptmanaging capacities but through a special sense which is properly called the moral sense because it is adapted to the perception of moral beauty as the eye is adapted to colours or the ear to sounds i have no doubt that men naturally have certain instinctive sensations or emotions that make them amiable and useful to each other examples are fellowfeeling with the distressed tenderness for our offspring affection towards our friends our neighbours and our country indignation against what is base cruel or unjust these emotions are implanted in the human soul along with various other factorsfears and appetites aversions and desireswith different minds differing in which of these are strongest and uppermost doesnt it then seem to be a very uncertain guide in morals for a man to follow his emotion or inward feeling if this were the general rule wouldnt it be sure to lead different men in different directions depending on which appetite or emotion was prevalent i dont deny that and doesnt it also follow that duty and virtue are more likely to be practised if men are led by reason and judgment balancing low and sensual pleasures against those of a higher kind present losses against future gains and the discomfort and disgust of every vice against the delightful practice of the opposite virtue and the pleasing thoughts and hopes that go with it or can there be a stronger motive to virtue than the belief that all things considered it is in every mans true selfinterest i tell you euphranor we despise the virtue of the man who calculates and deliberates and must have a reason for being virtuous the refined moralists among the freethinkers are enchanted and carried away by the abstract beauty of virtue they love virtue only for its own sake try an experiment on the first man you meet propose to him a villainous or unjust action get his initial sense of the matter and youll find that he detests it he may indeed later on be misled by arguments or overpowered by temptation but his original unpremeditated genuine thoughts are right and orthodox how can we account for this except through a moral sense which when left to itself has as quick and true a perception of the beauty and ugliness of human actions as the eye has of colours mightnt this be adequately explained in terms of conscience affection emotion education reason custom religion for all i know those sources of moral behaviour may be what you metaphorically call a moral sense what i call a moral sense is strictly literally and truly a sense and is different in kind from all the things you have just listed all men have it though some may fail to be aware of it in themselves euphranor smiled and said alciphron has made discoveries where i least expected him to in regard to everything else i would hope to learn from him but for knowledge of myself of the faculties and powers of my own mind i would have looked at home and i might have looked there for a good long time without finding this new talent even now after being tutored i still cant understand it i must say that alciphron speaks in a way that is too highflown and obscure for a topic that ought to be the most clearly understood of all i have often heard that your deepest experts and oldest and most experienced theoreticians are the most obscure lysicles is young and speaks plainly if he would favour us with his view of the moral sense that might perhaps be nearer to a level at which i can understand lysicles shook his head and in a solemn and earnest manner addressed us all gentlemen he said alciphron stands on his own legs i have no part in these refined notions he is now committed to defending if i must subdue my emotions take things in an abstract way think deeply love virtuein short if i must be an enthusiastthe deference i owe to the laws of my country make me choose to be an enthusiast in their way besides it is better to be an enthusiast for some end than to be an enthusiast for none this doctrine of virtue based not on religion but on a moral sense has all the solid inconveniences of the christian doctrine without its distracting hopes and prospects i wasnt counting on lysicles to back me up in this matter which after all doesnt need his help different topics require different treatments a subject may be too obscure for the dry and pedantic method of definition and distinctiondrawing or it may be too simple for it and we may know too little about a subject to be able to make it plainer by talking about it or we may know too much for further talk to be any help for my part i believe that if matters were fairly stated the rational satisfaction the peace of mind the inward comfort and conscientious joy that a good christian finds in good actions would not be found to fall short of all the ecstasy rapture and enthusiasm that are supposed to come from that high and undescribed source the moral sense seriously can any ecstasy be higher any rapture more affecting than what comes from the love of god and man from a conscience clear of sins from an inward discharge of duty with the secret delight trust and hope that go along with it o euphranor we who are devoted to the truth dont envy the groundless joys and mistaken hopes of a christianwe pity them and as for conscience and rational pleasure how can we allow a conscience without allowing a vindictive god and how can we suppose that the charm of virtue consists in any pleasure or benefit that comes from virtuous actions without thereby giving great advantages to the christian religion which seems to arouse its believers to virtue by the selfinterested pursuit of the highest pleasures as rewards alas if we granted this we would be opening the door to all those rusty old speeches about the necessity and usefulness of the great articles of faith the immortality of the soul an afterlife rewards and punishments and other such exploded notions according to our system and principles those factors may perhaps produce a low popular selfinterested kind of virtue but it is bound to destroy and extinguish virtue in the sublime and heroic sense of the word what youre saying now is perfectly intelligible i wish i understood your main principle as well so you are seriously at a loss can you really have no notion of beauty or have it but not know beauty to be lovable in itself and for itself tell me alciphron do all mankind have the same notion of a beautiful face the physical beauty of human beings seems to be rather mixed and various but isnt there a steady standard of beauty with regard to other things doesnt every human mind have the idea of order harmony and proportion o alciphron its a weakness of mine that i tend to get lost when the talk is abstract and general particular things are better suited to my faculties so let us stay with the objects of the senses and try to discover what it is that makes them beautiful and then using these sensible things as a ladder climb to the level of moral and intellectual beauty so please tell me what is it that we call beauty in the objects of sense alciphrons answer would as euphranor points out allow for beauty in tastes and smells so he tries again with an account that limits beauty to what can be seen alciphron after a short pause said that beauty consisted in a certain symmetry or proportion pleasing to the eye is this proportion the very same in everything or is it different in different kinds of things different doubtless the proportions of an ox would not be beautiful in a horse and we see also in inanimate things that the beauty of a table a chair a door consists in different proportions see qa note on page i this proportion implies the relation of one thing to another ii and these relations are based on size and shape iii for the proportions to be right those mutual relations of size and shape in the parts must be such as to make the whole thing complete and perfect in its kind iv a thing is said to be perfect in its kind when it fits the purpose for which it was made v so the parts have to be related and adjusted to one another in such a way that they can best work together to make the whole thing work properly vi but comparing parts with one another viewing them as belonging to one whole and relating this whole to its use or purpose seems to be the work of reason vii so strictly speaking proportions are not perceived by the sense of sight but only by reason through the means of sight viii so beauty in your sense of it is an object not of the eye but of the mind ix so the eye alone cant see that a chair is handsome or a door well proportioned that seems to follow but im not clear on this point lets see if theres any difficulty in it that chair you are sitting in do you think it could be regarded as wellproportioned or handsome if it didnt have that height depth breadth and wasnt adjusted so as to be comfortable to sit in it could not so the beauty or symmetry of a chair cant be taken in unless you know what the chair is for and relate its shape to that intended use and that cant be done by the eye aloneits work for the judgment so it is one thing to see an object and another to detect its beauty i admit this to be true he now repeats the point with the example of a door the standards for what makes a door beautifully proportioned reflect the fact that doors are for humans to go through alciphron agrees then tell me alciphron isnt there something truly decent and beautiful in dress no doubt there is if we want to get an idea of beauty in dress is anyone more likely to give it to us than painters and sculptors whose business it is to aim at graceful representations i believe not well then lets examine the draperies of the great masters in these arts for example how they were accustomed to clothe a matron or a man of rank he then launches into a fierce attack on current standards of dress the greeks and romans dressed themselves in a becoming manner whereas our gothic gentry have adopted standards and fashions that are absurd and ridiculous the reason for this and alciphron agrees is that instead of consulting use reason and convenience the moderns have gone in for fancy the unnatural parent of monsters he concludes that the beauty of dress depends on its serving certain ends and uses euphranor then launches into a fresh set of examples quoting virgil on a beautiful horse and then reporting ancient greek ideas about what makes a pillar beautiful there follows a long speech about architectural standards all of which is aimed at showing the subordinate relative nature of beauty architectural beauty he says reflects not only the use to which the building is to be put but also certain relationships to natural thingseg the proportions that make for beauty in a greek pillar have a definite relationship to the proportions of a wellshaped human body euphranor sums up the grand distinction between ancient greek and gothic architecture is that the gothic is fantastical and mostly not based on nature or reason necessity or use these being what account for all the beauty grace and ornament of the architecture of ancient greece what euphranor has said confirms the opinion i always entertained that the rules of architecture as of all other arts that flourished among the greeks were based on truth and nature and good sense he then expounds the point that the ancients didnt adhere slavishly to their rules of proportion etc being willing to depart from them whenever the particular distance position elevation or dimension of the building or its parts seemed to require it he contrasts careful and rational departure from rules with the capricious fantasticalness of contemporary architecture now i need something to be made clearernamely what the point is of this architectural detour werent we enquiring into beauty we were well what do you think alciphrondoesnt some real principle of beauty have to be at work when something pleases us here and now and also gave pleasure two thousand years ago and two thousand miles away yes it does and isnt that how things stand with respect to a sound piece of architecture nobody denies it architecture the noble offspring of judgment and fancy was gradually formed in the most civilised and informed countries of asia and in egypt greece and italy it was valued and admired by the most flourishing states and most renowned monarchs who at vast expense improved it and brought it to perfection it seems more than any other art to be specially involved with order proportion and symmetry so isnt it reasonable for us to think that architecture is the art that is most likely to help us get some rational notion of the je ne sais quoi in beauty and havent we learned from our detour that there is no beauty without proportion and that proportions are to be judged as sound and true only to the extent that they relate appropriately to some certain use or purposethis potential usefulness being what basically makes them please and charm i admit all this to be true in the next three speeches principle is used in a sense related to b in euphranors speech on pages think of it as meaning approximately generator or source of energy given this doctrine id like to know what beauty can be found in a moral system that has been formed tied together and governed by chance fate or any other blind unthinking principle without thought there can be no purpose or design without a purpose there cant be any usefulness and without usefulness there cant be any of the fitness of proportion from which beauty springs cant we suppose that the world is permeated throughout by a certain vital principle of beauty order and harmony without supposing a god who inspects punishes and rewards the moral actions of men without supposing the immortality of the soul or an afterlifein brief without accepting any part of what is commonly called faith worship and religion is this principle that you are supposing a thinking one or not if not then it is all of a piece with chance or fate which was argued against a moment ago if it does think then id like alciphron to tell me what is so beautiful in a moral system headed by a supreme thinking being that doesnt protect the innocent punish the wicked or reward the virtuous he goes on eloquently and at length about the beauty of a moral system in which everyone sees himself as the member of a great city whose author and founder is god and where all conduct aims at the noblest end namely the complete happiness or wellbeing of the whole then there will be great beauty in a system of spirits that are subordinate to gods will and under his direction with him governing them by laws and directing them by methods that are suitable to wise and good ends but how can there be beauty in an incoherent system that is governed by chance or in a blind system that is governed by fate or in any system where god doesnt preside where there is no thought there is no design and therefore no order and therefore no beauty contrast these two scenes a man is conscious that his will is inwardly conformed to gods will which produces order and harmony in the universe and conducts the whole by the most just methods to the best end that gives a beautiful idea but then a man is conscious that his virtue is overlooked neglected or held against him by men and not regarded or rewarded by god that this world has treated him badly and he has no hope or prospect of being better treated in another world wheres the beauty in that what pleasure can we get from thinking about it and how could any sane person think that spreading this idea of our moral situation is the way to spread or propagate virtue in the world an enthusiast may entertain himself with visions and fine talk about such a system but when it comes to be considered by careful thinkers with cool heads i dont think they will find any beauty or perfection in it and they wont think that such a moral system can possibly be the work of the same divine hand as the natural world throughout which there shines so much order harmony and proportion all this serves to confirm me in my opinion i said earlier page that regarding this highlevel beauty of morality a mans first thoughts are best and that well risk losing sight of it if we examine inspect and reason about it that there is such a thing cant be doubted when we realize that some of our philosophers today have a high sense of virtue without the least notion of religion that is a clear proof of the usefulness and effectiveness of our principles granting that some minute philosophers are virtuous we may venture to question the cause of their virtue you attribute it to an inexplicable enthusiastic notion of moral beauty i think it comes as euphranor said from personal temperament custom and religious education but anyway assign what beauty you please to virtue in an irreligious system it cant be less in a religious one unless you hold that virtues charms diminish as her dowry increases take all the motives of every sort that an unbeliever can possibly get from the beauty of virtue a believer can have them too as well as other motives that an unbeliever doesnt have so it is obvious that those of your sect who have moral virtue dont get it from their special freethinking doctrines which serve only to lessen the motives to virtue good freethinkers are less good and bad ones are more bad than they would have been if they were believers it seems to me that those heroic unbelieving lovers of abstract moral beauty are much to be pitied and much to be amazed by lysicles broke in impatiently gentlemen he said you shall have my whole thoughts about this topic plain and unvarnished everything that is said about a moral sense or about moral beauty in any meaning of that phrase whether said by alciphron or euphranor or anyone else i regard as basically mere windowdressing and pretence the beautiful and the decent are outward things and are relative and superficial they have no effect in the dark as they would if there were something solid about them they are merely showpieces to argue over and make speeches about as some of the selfannounced members our sect are accustomed to doing orthodox though they are about other things but if one of them got into power you wouldnt find him such a fool as euphranor imagines he would soon show that he had learned that the love of ones country is a prejudice that mankind are rogues and hypocrites and that it would be folly to sacrifice oneself for the sake of the likes of them that everything that matters relates to this life and that because to every man this life means his own life it clearly follows that charity begins at home claims are made of benevolence to mankind but what wise people put into practice is benevolence to themselves among our freethinker philosophers the livelier ones dont hesitate to accept these maxims openly and as for the more solemn ones we can guess what they must really think if they are true to their principles whatever effect pure theory may have on certain minority of very unusual minds or in some other parts of the world i really do think that in england now reason religion and law are all together little enough to get people to act in accordance with their consciences and that it would be downright stupid to think that without reason religion and law men would be in love with the golden mean ie in love with a temperate way of life one in which extremes are avoided indeed my countrymen may be even less inclined to be like that than others are because in the makeup of an english mind there is a certain hot eagerness that carries us to the sad extremein religion to fanaticism in freethinking to atheism in liberty to rebellion he goes on to say that the english like other northern people dont go in for beauty much and when they try they make a hash of it winding up but in no case is it to be hoped that the beautiful he says it in greek will be the leading idea of the great majority who have quick senses strong emotions and blunt intellects the fewer they are the more we should respect and admire such philosophers whose souls are transported by this sublime idea of moral beauty but then one might expect from such philosophers enough good sense and philanthropy to make them keep their tenets to themselves and consider the situation of their weak brethren who are more strongly affected by notions of another kind than that of the beauty of pure disinterested virtue consider the example of cratylus what follows is aimed at the third earl of shaftesbury who is berkeleys targetnot always fairly treatedthrough much of this work he was prejudiced against the christian religion was of an unsound constitution had a rank in society higher than most men can even aim at had a fortune equal to his rank had little capacity for sensual vices or temptation to dishonest ones he talked himself or thought he had into a stoic enthusiasm about the beauty of virtue then under the pretence of making men heroically virtuous he tried by undermining religion to destroy the means of making them reasonably and humanly so this is a clear example of the fact that neither birth nor books nor conversation can introduce a knowledge of the world into a conceited mind that will attend only to itself and look at mankind only in its own mirror cratylus was a lover of liberty and of his country he aimed to make men uncorrupt and virtuous on the purest and most disinterested principles its true that the main aim of all his writings as he himself tells us was to assert the reality of a beauty and charm in moral subjects as well as in natural ones to demonstrate a taste that he thinks more effective than principle to recommend morals on the same basis as manners and in this way to make progress in moral philosophy by giving it the same basis as the notions of what is agreeable and socially acceptable as for religious qualms the belief in an afterlife of rewards and punishments and such matters this great man doesnt hesitate to declare that the liberal polished and refined part of mankind must consider them only as childrens tales and pastimes of the vulgar so for the sake of the better sort of people he has in his great goodness and wisdom thought of something else namely a taste or flavour this he assures us is something that will influence people because according to him anyone who has any impression of gentility or polish is so acquainted with the fittingness and grace of things as to be easily bowled over by the thought of it his conduct seems to be about as wise as that of a monarch who announces that in his kingdom there is no jail and no executioner to enforce the laws but that it is beautiful to obey the laws and that in doing so men will taste the pure delight that results from order and decorum yet isnt it true that certain ancient philosophers ones of great noteheld the same opinion as cratylus declaring that noone counts as a good man if he practises virtue for any reason except that it is beautiful yes i think some of the ancients said things that gave rise to this opinion aristotle distinguishes between two ways in which someone can be a good manone he calls agathos or simply good the other he calls kalos kagathos these are hard to translate into english but his sense is plainly this agathos is the man to whom the good things of nature are good according to aristotle things that are vulgarly regarded as the greatest goodsriches honours power and bodily perfectionsare indeed good by nature and yet they happen to be hurtful and bad to some people because of their bad habits so that those natural goods are not good for a fool an unjust man or an intemperate man any more than a sick man is helped by getting nourishment that is proper for those who are in good health and kalos kagathos is the man in whom are to be found all things worthy and decent and praiseworthy purely as such and for their own sake and who practises virtue solely because of his love of virtues innate beauty aristotle also observes that there is a certain political way of thinking and behaving that the spartans and others had who thought that virtue was to be valued and practised because of the natural advantages that come with it this makes them good men he says but they dont have the supreme consummate virtue this makes it clear that according to aristotle someone can be a good man without believing that virtue its own reward or being moved to virtue only by the sense of moral beauty its also clear that he distinguishes the political virtue of nations which the public is everywhere concerned to maintain from this highminded and theoretical kind of virtue notice also that his highlevel kind of virtue was consistent with supposing a providence that inspects and rewards the virtues of the best men he says if the gods care at all about human affairs as they seem to it seems reasonable to suppose that they are most delighted with the part of our nature that is most excellent and most like their own natures namely our minds and that they will reward those who chiefly love and cultivate what is most dear to them he remarks that the majority of mankind are naturally inclined to be awed not by shame but by fear and to abstain from vicious conduct not because of its ugliness but only because of the punishment it brings all this shows us very clearly what aristotle would have thought of those who would set to work to lessen or destroy mankinds hopes and fears in order to make them virtuous purely because of the beauty of virtue well whatever aristotle and his followers thought isnt it certain that the stoics maintained this doctrine in its highest sense asserting that the beauty of virtue is allsufficient that virtue is her own reward that only virtue could make a man happy despite all the things that are vulgarly regarded as the greatest woes and miseries of human life and they held all this while also believing that the soul of man is some kind of material thing which at death is dissipated like a flame or vapour yes the stoics do sometimes talk as if they believed the soul to be mortal in dealing with this topic in one of his letters seneca speaks much like a minute philosopher but in several other places he declares himself to have the outright opposite opinion asserting that mens souls after death rise into the heavens and look down on earth crito then talks learnedly about marcus aurelius he sometimes speaks of the soul as perishing or scattering but for him the soul was a rather low part of a man to be distinguished from his mind or governing principle at a mans death according to him the mind remains intact it is a particle of god which goes back whole to the stars and the divinity concluding thus along with all his magnificent lessons and splendid views about the force and beauty of virtue marcus is positive about the existence of god in the strict sense of a providence inspecting and taking care of human affairs despite their high style therefore the stoics cant be said to have reduced every motive for living virtuously to just onethe beauty of virtuein such a way as to attempt to destroy peoples belief in the immortality of the soul and a providence that hands out rewards and punishments and anyway supposing that the disinterested stoics did make virtue its own and its only reward taking this in the most rigid and absolute sense what does that imply for those of us who are not stoics if we adopt all the principles of that sect accepting their notions of good and evil their famous indifference to sufferingin short setting ourselves up as complete stoicsthat may enable us to maintain this doctrine of virtue for its own sake with a better grace at least it will fit consistently into our whole stoic scheme of things but if you borrow this splendid patch from the stoics hoping to make a big impression by inserting it into a modern composition spiced with the wit and notions of the present day youll make an impression all right but on the mind of a wise man it may not be the impression you intended though i must admit that although embroidering a stoic patch with jokes ought to make you look ridiculous you might get away with it because the present age is very indulgent to everything that aims at mockery of religion not everyone likes humorous writings and not everyone can produce them the truth is that the variety in readers tastes requires a variety of kinds of writers our sect has provided for this with great judgment to spread our word to people of the more serious sort we have men who can reason and argue deeply and well for the runofthemill general reading public we have writers who produce lengthy rhetorically persuasive pieces and for men of rank and social polish we have the finest and wittiest mockers in the world whose ridicule is the sure test of truth this refers to shaftesbury who in his book characteristics of men manners opinions times wrote about wit and humour in philosophy see qa note on page i no doubt that ingenious mockers are knowledgeable men ii they know about the copernican theory of the planets the circulation of the blood and so on iii they believe that there is land in the far south of the southern hemisphere that there are mountains on the moon that the earth moves iv if five or six centuries ago a man had maintained these notions among the clever wits at an english court they would have been received with ridicule v whereas now it would be ridiculous to ridicule them vi yet truth was the same then as it is now vii so it seems that ridicule is not such a secure test of truth as you gentlemen imagine one thing we do know our mockery and sarcasm infuriate the black tribe of priests and theologians and that is our comfort something else that it may be worthwhile for you to know men who are doubled over with laughter may be applauding a piece of mockery that theyll find contemptible when they recover from their laughing fit well anyway this much is certain our clever men make converts by deriding the principles of religion and i can assure you that mockery is the most successful and pleasing method of convincing someone these authors laugh men out of their religion as the latin poet horace laughed them out of their vices but a bigot cant enjoy their witindeed he cant detect it crito speaks slightingly of wit without wisdom then moves back to the centre of their topic of conversation citing examples from ancient rome of good able people whose attitude to virtue involved their belief in an afterlife in which virtue is rewarded alciphron replies that these men were very well for their times but that they didnt achieve the highlevel kind of virtue that our modern freethinkers have so it should seem that virtue flourishes more than ever among us it should and this abundant virtue is to be explained by the way in which your profound writers went about recommending it this i grant but you have admitted that enthusiastic lovers of virtue are not a majority in your sect but only a small select minority alciphron didnt answer this but crito stepped in to make a true estimate of the worth and growth of modern virtue he said to euphranor what you should go by is not the number of virtuous men but rather the quality of their virtue and the virtue of these refined freethinking theorists is so pure and genuine that a very little of it goes a long way in fact it is invaluable theres no comparison between it and the reasonable selfinterested virtue of the english of earlier times or of the spartans turns of phrase which could mean that this kind of morality is very powerful and so wonderful as to be above all price and incomparably better than the morality of the spartans etc but which could instead mean that the less we see of it the better and it is worthless and is it incomparably worse that the morality of the spartans etc see qa note on page i there are diseases of the soul as well as of the body ii the diseases of the soul are vicious habits iii and just as bodily ailments are cured by medicines mental ailments are cured by philosophy iv so it seems that philosophy is a medicine for the soul of man v the way we judge concerning medicines deciding which ones to prefer is from the effects they bring about vi suppose that in the middle of an epidemic a new physician condemned the known established practice and recommended another method of cure and suppose that some people had plausible things to say in support of this proposal wouldnt you be inclined to let your attitude to it be governed by whatever difference it made to the mortality figures all you are doing is creating confusion and taking us away from our topic this reminds me of my friend lamprocles who needed only one argument against unbelievers i have noticed he told me that as unbelief grew so did corruption of every kind as well as new vices this simple observation of a matter of fact was enough to make him fill the minds of his children from an early age with the principles of religion despite the protests of many clever men the new theories that our clever moderns have tried to substitute for religion have run their full course in our times and have produced their effect on the minds and conduct of men that men are men is a sure maxim but its equally sure that englishmen are not the same men that they wereand you dont need me to tell you whether they are better or worse more or less virtuous than they used to be everyone can see and judge that for himself whatever the consequences may be i can never bring myself to agree with those who measure truth by convenience the only god i worship is truth wherever it leads i shall follow so you have a passion for truth undoubtedly for all truths for all to know them or to publish them both what would you busily correct the procedures of an enemy who was going about his attack in the wrong way would you help an enraged man to take out his sword in such cases common sense tells one how to behave so common sense should be consulted about whether a truth is salutary or hurtful fit to be declared or fit to be concealed how you would have me conceal and stifle the truth and keep it to myself is that what you aim at i only draw an obvious conclusion from things you say as for myself i dont believe that your opinions are true you do but if you are going to be consistent with yourself you shouldnt think it necessary or wise to publish hurtful truths just because they are true what service can it do mankind to lessen the motives to virtue and what harm can it do to increase them none in the world but i have to say that i cant square the accepted notions of god and providence with my understanding and i am just naturally revolted by the lowness of pretending not to notice a falsehood shall we therefore appeal to truth and examine the reasons that hold you back from believing in god and providence with all my heart but that is enough for just now lets make this the subject of our next conversation fourth dialogue thursday as i looked out of my window early the next morning i saw alciphron walking in the garden with all the signs of a man in deep thought i went down to him alciphron i said this early and profound meditation frightens me why because i would be sorry to be convinced that there is no god the thought of anarchy in nature is more shocking to me than the thought of anarchy in civil life because natural concerns are more important than civil ones and are the basis of all the others i grant replied alciphron that some inconvenience might follow from disproving the existence of god but as for what you say of fright and shocking all that is nothing but prejudice mere prejudice men form an idea or fanciful picture in their own minds and then bow down and worship it notions govern mankind but no other notion has taken such deep root or spread so widely as the notion of gods governing the world so its an heroic achievement by philosophy to unthrone this imaginary monarch and banish all those fears and spectres that only the light of reason can dispel it will be my role i said to stand by as i have done up to now taking notes of everything that happens during this memorable eventthe attempt of a less than sixfeettall minute philosopher to dethrone the monarch of the universe they kick this around a little and then are joined by euphranor and by crito who remarks that with alciphron having made such an early start we can expect to see atheism placed in the best light and supported by the strongest arguments then they get straight on with it not even finding somewhere to sit down the existence of a god is a subject on which countless commonplaces have been uttered theres no need for me to repeat them so allow me lay down certain rules and limitations so as to shorten this conversation the aim of debating is to persuade so anything that wont persuade should be left out of our debate here are three limitations on arguments against me i cant be persuaded by metaphysical arguments such as those from the idea of an allperfect being or from the absurdity of an infinite chain of causes i have always found arguments of this sort dry and thin and because they arent suited to my way of thinking they may puzzle me but theyll never convince me i cant be persuaded by the authority either of past ages or our present time the authority of mankind in general or of particular wise men none of that counts for much with a man who argues soundly and thinks freely arguments based on the utility or convenience of the belief in god are beside the point they may indeed prove the usefulness of the belief but not the existence of the thing the rigorous eyes of a philosopher can see that truth and convenience are very different things whatever legislators or statesmen may think so that i wont seem biased i also propose two limitations on arguments that i can use on my side i wont argue from anything that may seem irregular or unaccountable in the works of nature to the conclusion that nature is not caused by infinite power and wisdom i already know how you would answer such an argument if i did use it namely by saying that noone can judge the symmetry and use of the parts of an infinite machinewhose appropriateness and usefulness depends on how they relate to each other and to the wholewithout having a grasp of the entire machine the whole universe i undertake not to argue from premises about the harms that good men suffer and the prosperity that wicked men often enjoy in this life if i did argue in that way i know how you would reply instead of admitting this as a good argument against the existence of god you would make it an argument for an afterlife in which rewards and punishments will be distributed in ways that vindicate the divine attributes and set everything right at the end by not using those arguments i deprive you of an opportunity to give those answers but there is no unfairness in that even if the answers are good ones they arent arguments for the existence of god all they do is to solve certain difficulties that might be brought against the existence of god on the assumption that it had already been proved by proper argumentsi thought i should specify all this so as to save us all time and trouble what we should be aiming at here is the discovery and defence of truth and truth may be justified not only by persuading its adversaries but alsoif they cant be persuadedby showing them to be unreasonable so an argument that sheds light will have its effect even against an opponent who shuts his eyes because it will show him to be obstinate and prejudiced anyway minute philosophers are less attentive than anyone to this distinction between arguments that puzzle and arguments that convince so the distinction neednt be respected by others in their favour but euphranor may be willing to encounter you on your own terms in which case i have nothing more to say alciphron acts like a skillful general who works to get the advantage of the ground and entice the enemy to come out of their trenches we who believe in a god are entrenched in tradition custom authority and law but alciphron does not try to dislodge us instead he proposes that we should voluntarily abandon these entrenchments and attack him when we could easily and securely act on the defensive leaving him the trouble to dispossess us of what we need not resign the reasons that you have mustered up in your earlymorning meditation he continued addressing alciphron if they dont weaken our belief in a god must help to strengthen it for the utmost is to be expected from such a great a master in his profession when he really gets to work on something i regard the confused notion of a deity or supreme invisible power to be the most unconquerable of all prejudices when half a dozen able men get together over a glass of wine in a well lighted room we easily banish all the spectres of imagination or upbringing and are very clear about what we think and why but as i was taking a solitary walk before it was broad daylight this morning the issue seemed not quite so clear and i couldnt bring to mind the force of the arguments that have usually appeared so conclusive at other times i experienced a strange kind of awe and seemed haunted by a sort of panic which i cant account for except by supposing it to be the effect of prejudice you see i like the rest of the world was once a long time ago drilled and tutored into the belief in a god there is no surer mark of prejudice than believing something without any reason so what need is there for me to set myself the difficult task of proving a negative when it is sufficient for me to point out that there is no proof of the affirmative and that accepting it without proof is unreasonable so go ahead and prove your opinion if you cant you may indeed continue to have it but what you have will be merely a prejudice o alciphron if we are to content you we must prove it seems and we must do it on your terms well for a start let us see what sort of proof you expect the sort of proof i demand im not saying i expect it is the sort that every intelligent man requires for any matter of fact or for the existence of any particular thing other than himself why do i believe there is a king of great britain because i have seen him or a king of spain because i have seen people who saw him but as for this king of kingsi havent seen him myself nor have i seen anyone else who has seen him if there is such a thing as god surely its very strange that he has left himself without a witness that men should still be arguing about his existence and that there should be not a single evident sensible plain proof of his existence without having to bring in philosophy or metaphysics a matter of fact has to be proved not by notions but by facts you see what i am up to these are the principles on the basis of which i defy superstition so you believe as far as you can see that is my rule of faith what you wont believe in the existence of things that you hear unless you also see them no thats wrong when i insisted on seeing i meant to be talking about perceiving in general outward objects make very different impressions on the animal spirits impressions that are lumped together under the common label sense and whatever we can perceive by any sense we may be sure of a widely accepted theory going back at least as far as descartes held that the workings of animal bodies involve animal spirits envisaged as extremely fine and fluid matter that can get through holes that are too small to let even air pass through so you believe that there are such things as animal spirits doubtless what sense do you perceive them by i dont perceive them immediately by any of my senses but i am convinced of their existence because i can infer it from their effects and operations they are the messengers which running to and fro in the nerves enable outward objects to affect the soul so you admit the existence of a soul provided i dont admit an immaterial substance i see no drawback to allowing that there may be such a thing as a soul it may be no more than a thin fine texture of superfine parts or spirits residing in the brain im not asking about its nature i only ask whether you accept that there is a source of thought and action and whether it is perceivable by sense i grant that there is such a source and that it isnt itself an object of sense but we infer it from appearances that are perceived by sense see qa note on page i if i understand you rightly from animal functions and motions you infer the existence of animal spirits and from reasonable acts you infer the existence of a reasonable soul ii so it seems that the existence of things that cant be perceived through the senses can be inferred from sensible effects and signs iii the soul is what makes the principal distinction between a real person and a shadow between a living man and a carcass iv so i cant know that you for instance are a distinct thinking individual a living real man except by inferring from certain signs that you have a soul v all acts that are immediately and properly perceived by sense come down to motion vi so from motions you infer a mover or cause and from reasonable motions or such as appear calculated for a reasonable end you infer a rational cause soul or spirit vii now the soul of man drives only a small body an insignificant particle by comparison with the great masses of nature the elements the heavenly bodies the system of the world and the wisdom that appears in the motions that are the effect of human reason is incomparably less than the wisdom that reveals itself in the structure and use of organized natural bodies animal or plant a man cant make with his hand a machine as admirable as the hand itself and none of the motions by which we trace out human reason come anywhere near to the skill and ingenuity of the wonderful motions of the heart brain and other vital parts that dont depend on the will of man viii so it follows that from natural motions that are independent of mans will we can infer both power and wisdom incomparably greater than that of the human soul ix furthermore in natural productions and effects there is a visible unity of plan and design the rules of nature are fixed and immovable the same laws of motion apply throughout the same in china and here the same two thousand years ago and today x and from the mutual respects influences subordinations and uses involved in the way animals relate to plants animals and plants relate to the elements and elements relate to heavenly bodies we can infer that they are all parts of one whole all working towards the same end and fulfilling the same design supposing all this to be true wont it then follow that this vastly great perhaps infinitepower and wisdom must be supposed to be in one single agent spirit or mind and that our certainty of the existence of this infinitely wise and powerful spirit is at least as clear full and immediate as our certainty of the existence of any one human soul apart from our own let me think i suspect we proceed too hastily remember that in the original qa version alciphron gave a consecutive series of nine positive answersit is it may i grant it is and so on what do you claim that you can have the same assurance of the existence of a god that you can have of my existence when you actually see me stand in front of you and talk to you the very same assurance if not a greater how do you support that the phrase the person alciphron means an individual thinking thing not the hair skin or visible surface or any part of the outward form colour or shape of alciphron this i grant in granting that you grant that strictly speaking i dont see alciphron ie that individual thinking thing but only visible signs and tokens that suggest and imply the existence of that invisible source of thought or soul in exactly the same way it seems to me that though i cant with my physical eyes see the invisible god i do in the strictest sense see and perceive by all my senses the signs and tokens effects and operations that suggest and indicate and demonstrate the existence of an invisible god doing this as certainly and making it at least as evident as any signs suggesting to me the existence of your soul spirit or thinking principle i am convinced that your soul exists by a few signs or effects and the movements of one small organic body whereas i am always and everywhere perceiving sensible signs that point to the existence of god so the thesis that you doubted or denied at the outset now seems obviously to follow from the premises throughout this whole inquiry havent we carefully thought about every step we took not moving to accept any proposition that wasnt clearly evident you and i examined and assented to each foregoing proposition one by one so what should we do with the conclusion speaking for myself if you dont come to my rescue i shall absolutely have to accept the conclusion as true so if i live and die as a believer in god youll have to take the blame i have to admit that i dont readily find an answer there seems to be some foundation for what you say but if this matter is as clear as you claim it is i cannot conceive how so many able men of our sect of freethinkers should be so much in the dark that they dont know or believe one syllable of it alciphron its not our present business to explain the oversights or vindicate the honour of those great men the freethinkers when their very existence is in danger of being called in question how so remember your concessions and then show me if the arguments for a god are not conclusive what better argument you have to prove the existence of the thinking thing which in strictness constitutes the freethinker alciphron stopped in his tracks and stood in a posture of meditation while the rest of us continued our walk after a little while he rejoined us with a smiling face like someone who had made some discovery i have found he said something that may clear up the point in dispute and completely answer euphranors challenge i mean an argument that will prove the existence of a freethinker but cant be adapted to prove the existence of a god this idea of yours that we perceive the existence of god as certainly and immediately as we do that of a human person was more than i could swallow though i have to admit that it puzzled me until i had thought it through at first i thought that a particular structure shape or motion might be the most certain proof of a thinking reasonable soul but a little attention satisfied me that these things have no necessary connection with reason knowledge and wisdom perhaps they are certain proofs of a living soul but they cant be certain proofs of a thinking and reasonable one on second thoughts and after a minute examination of this point i have found that nothing so much convinces me of the existence of another person as his speaking to me its hearing you talk that is the best strict and philosophical argument i have for your existence and this is a restricted argument that cant be adapted to your purpose for you wont claim that god speaks to man in the same clear and audible way as one man speaks to anotherwill you what is the impression of sound so much more evident than that of other senses and if it is is the voice of man louder than that of thunder you are missing the point what im talking about is not the sheer sound of speech but language we have perceptible signs that dont resembleand arent necessarily connected withthe things they signify the way we use them is arbitrary in the sense of being chosen by us rather than laid down in the nature of things and what we use them for is to suggest and exhibit to the minds of others an endless variety of things that differ in nature time and place thereby giving one another information entertainment and direction for how to act with regard to near and present things and also distant and future things whether these signs are pronounced and heard or written and seen they have the same use and are equally proofs of an intelligent thinking designing cause but what if it should appear that god really speaks to man would this content you i dont accept stories about inward speech holy instincts or indications of light or spirit men of good sense regard all that as nothing to achieve something on this topic youll need to make it plain to me that god speaks to men by outward perceptible signs of the same kind and in the same way as i have defined well if i show it to be plainly the case that god speaks to men through arbitrary outward perceptible signs that dont resembleand arent necessarily connected withthe things they stand for and suggest and that by countless combinations of these signs an endless variety of things is revealed and made known to us and that through this we are instructed or informed about the different natures of things are taught and warned about what to avoid and what to pursue and are told how to regulate our movements and how to act with respect to things that are far off in space or in the futurewill this satisfy you its just the thing im challenging you to prove for it incorporates the force and use and nature of language see qa note on page i look alciphron you can see a castle on that hill over there ii it is a long way away iii a things distance from oneself is a line turned endwise to the eye iv and a line in that situation cant project more than one single point on the bottom of the eye v so the appearance of a long distance has the same size as the appearance of a short one or rather neither of them has any size at all because always what you have at the eye is a single point vi it follows from this that distance is not immediately perceived by the eye vii so it must be perceived by the mediation of some other thing viii to discover what this mediatorthis intermediate itemis let us examine how the appearance of an object changes as it is placed at different distances from the eye i find by experience that as an object is moved further and further away from me its visible appearance becomes lesser and fainter and this change of appearance seems to be what we go by in taking in differences of distance ix but littleness or faintness dont seem in themselves to be necessarily connected with greater distance x so its only because of our experience that littleness and faintness suggest or are signs of distance x that is to say we dont perceive distance immediately we perceive it through the mediation of a sign that doesnt resemble it and isnt necessarily connected with it but only suggests it on the basis of repeated experience as words suggest things wait a bit euphranor ive just remembered that writers on optics tell us of an angle that the two optic axes make where they meet at the object being looked at the more obtuse this angle is the nearer it shows the object to be and the more acute the angle the further away the object is and this holds not as something arbitrary that we learn by experience but as a necessary connection that can be demonstrated so the mind discovers how far away things are by geometry it does wouldnt it follow then that the only people who could see are those who have learned geometry and know something of lines and angles theres a sort of natural geometry that is acquired without learning but alciphron in order to construct a proof of any kind or deduce a conclusion from premises dont i have to perceive how the terms are connected with one another in the premises and how the premises are connected with the conclusion more generally if i am to know one thing x by means of another thing y dont i first have to know y when i perceive your meaning by your words dont i have first to perceive the words themselves and in any inference dont i have to know the premises before i infer the conclusion all this is true thus whoever infers a nearer distance from a wider angle or a further distance from an acuter angle must first perceive the angles themselves someone who doesnt perceive those angles cant infer anything from them can he it is as you say now ask the first man you meet whether he perceives or knows anything of those optic angles or whether he ever thinks about them or infers anything from them whether by natural or by artificial geometry how would you expect him to answer candidly i think he would answer that he knew nothing of those matters so it cant be true that men judge distance by angles and that removes all the force from your argument to prove that distance is perceived by means of something that has a necessary connection with it i agree with you it seems to me that a man can know whether or not he perceives a thing and if he does perceive it he can know whether he does this immediately or mediately and if he perceives it mediately he can know whether he is doing this by means of something like or unlike the thing necessarily or arbitrarily connected with it it seems so and isnt it certain that if distance is not perceived immediately just by itself or by means of any image that resembles it or by means of any lines and angles that have a necessary connection with it it is perceived only by means of experience it is from the things i have said and you have agreed to doesnt it seem to follow that before a man had any experience he wouldnt imagine that the things he saw were at any distance from him what show me the smallness or faintness of appearance or any other idea or sensation that doesnt resemble distance and isnt necessarily connected with it cant suggest differences of distancecant suggest anything about distanceto a mind that hasnt experienced a connection between those things and distance any more than words can suggest notions to a man before he has learned the language i agree that thats true then doesnt it follow that a man who was born blind and was then enabled to see would when he first gained his sight take the things he saw to be not at any distance from him but rather in his eye or in his mind i have to admit that this seems right and yet i find it hard to believe that if i were in such a state i would think that the objects i now see at such a great a distance were at no distance at all so you do now think that the objects of sight are at a distance from you certainly i do can anyone question that that castle over there is at a great distance tell me alciphron can you pick out the doors windows and battlements of that same castle i cant at this distance it seems only a small round tower but i have visited the castle and i know that its not a small round tower but a large square building with battlements and turrets that you evidently dont see what do you infer from that i infer that the object that you strictly and properly perceive by sight is not the very same thing as the one that is several miles distant why so because a little round object is one thing and a great square object is another isnt that right i cant deny it tell me isnt the proper object of sightthe thing that we actually strictly immediately seethe visible appearance it is what do you now think about the visible appearance of the moon up there isnt it a round shining flat thing no bigger than a sixpence what if it is well tell me what you think about the moon itself dont you think of it as a vast opaque globe with many hills and valleys i do then how can you think that the proper object of your sight exists at a distance i admit that i dont know to convince you even more consider that crimson cloud in the east do you think that if you were in it you would perceive anything like what you now see by no means all i would see is a dark mist isnt it clear then that the castle the moon and the cloud that you see here are not the real castle moon and cloud that you suppose exist at a distance what am i to think then do we see anything at all or is the visual side of our lives nothing but fancy and illusion here is the bottom line as i understand it the proper objects of sight are light and colours with their many hues and degrees of saturation and of brightness these can be varied and put together in countless different ways forming a language that is wonderfully adapted to indicate and exhibit to us the distances shapes locations sizes and various qualities of tangible objects ones we can perceive through our sense of touch the objects of sight dont resemble the tangible things nor are they necessarily connected with them the association of sight with touch is due to gods choosing it its like the association between words and the things signified by them what dont we strictly speaking perceive by sight such things as trees houses men rivers and so on we do indeed perceive or apprehend those things by the faculty of sight but it doesnt follow from this they are the proper and immediate objects of sight any more than that all the things that are signified by the help of spoken words or sounds are the proper and immediate objects of hearing so you want us to think that light shades and colours variously combined correspond to the many articulations of sound in language and that by means of them all sorts of objects are suggested to the mind through the eye in the same way that they are suggested by words or sounds through the earie not through logical inference by the faculty of judgment and not through similarities that are picked up by the imagination but purely and solely from experience custom and habit i dont want you to think anything more than the nature of things obliges you to think i dont want you to submit in the least to my judgment but only to the force of truth and i doubt if even the freest thinkers will claim to be exempt from that constraint you have led me step by step to a place where i am lost but ill try to get out again if not by the way i came then by some other that i find for myself short pause then tell me euphranor wouldnt it follow from these principles that a man who had been born blind and was then enabled to see would at first sight not only not perceive how far away men and trees etc were from him but also not perceive that they were men and trees surely this is absurd i agree that the principles we have both accepted do imply that such a man would never think of men trees or any other objects that he had been accustomed to perceive only by touch at the stage of his development that we are talking about his mind would be filled with new sensations of light and colours whose various combinations he wouldnt yet understand or know the meaning of any more than a chinese person on first hearing the words man and tree would think of men and trees in each case there has to be time and experience in which repeated events would enable him to acquire a habit of knowing how the signs are connected with the things that are signified ie to enable him to understand the language whether the language of the eyes or the language of the ears i see nothing absurd in all this the phrase the language of the eyes refers not to human language as written down but to gods language in which the visual appearances of things inform us about their distances and their tactual qualities in strict philosophical truth therefore i see that rock only in the sense in which i hear that rock when i hear the word rock being uttered in the very same sense then why is it that everyone will say that he sees a rock or a house when those things are before his eyes whereas nobody will say that he hears a rock or a house when he hears and understands the words rock or house and a second point if vision is only a language speaking to the eyes when did men learn this language its a pretty difficult task to learn the meanings of all the signs that make up a language but noone will say that he has devoted time and trouble to learning this language of vision thats not surprising if we have been all practising this language ever since our first entrance into the world if god constantly speaks to the eyes of all mankind even in their earliest infancy whenever their eyes are open in the light it doesnt seem to me at all strange that men arent aware they ever learned a language that they began on so early and practised so constantly as this language of vision remember also that it is the same language throughout the whole world and not differing in different places as other languages do so we can understand how men might mistake the connection between the proper objects of sight and the things they signify for some kind of similarity or necessary relation and even how they might take them to be the same things euphranor then points out that our conscious minds tend overlook things that we are in fact steering by when they are extremely familiar for example youve been reading this page without consciously attending to the individual letters of which the words are made up alciphron grumbles that euphranors points are too dry and tedious for a gentlemans attention crito snaps back at him alciphron replies trying to lower the temperature and then to cut short this squabbling resumes the discussion i put it fairly to your own conscience do you really think that god himself speaks every day and in every place to the eyes of all men that is really and truly what i think and you should think it too if you are consistent with yourself and stand by your own definition of language you cant deny that the great mover and author of nature constantly explains himself to the eyes of men by means of perceptible arbitrary signs that have no resemblance or necessary connection with the things signified so that by compounding and arranging them to suggest and exhibit an endless variety of objects of different kinds in different times and places thereby informing and directing men how to act with respect to distant and future things as well as near and present ones the compounding and arranging part of this is offered as analogous to constructing sentences out of words there will soon be a good deal more about this these are your views as well as mine and their consequence is that you have as much reason to think god speaks to your eyes as you can have for thinking that any given person speaks to your ears i cant help thinking that some fallacy runs throughout this whole line of argument though i cant easily put a finger on it it seems to me that every other sense has as good a claim as vision to be called a language smells and tastes for example are signs that inform us of other qualities to which they have neither resemblance nor necessary connection certainly they are signs there is a general concept of sign that covers the parts of language as well as all those other signs but equally certainly not all signs are languagenot even all significant sounds such as the natural cries of animals or the inarticulate sounds and interjections of men the true nature of language consists in the articulation combination variety copiousness extensive and general use and easy application of signsand all of these are commonly found in vision as well as in languages more conventionally socalled other senses may indeed provide signs but those signs have no more right to be thought to be a language than inarticulate sounds such as a pained grunt or a surprised whistle wait let me see in language the signs are arbitrary arent they they are and consequently they dont always suggest real matters of fact because people sometimes say things that are false whereas this natural language of vision as you call it or these visible signs do always suggest things in the same uniform way and have the same constant regular connection with matters of fact which seems to imply that their connection with what they signify is necessary which would mean they werent a language after all according to the definition of language that we have been working with how do you solve this objection you can solve it yourself with the help of a picture or a mirror youre right i see there is nothing in it when i look at a certain picture i receive a visual statement that theres a yellow tiger on that wall and there isnt when i look in a mirror i receive a visual statement that theres a bearded old man staring at me and there isnt this simple point really does counter alciphrons view that visual statements are necessarily connected with tangible realities i dont know what else to say about this view of yours other than that its so odd and contrary to my way of thinking that ill never assent to it remember please your own lectures about prejudice and apply them in the present case maybe they will help you to follow where reason leads and to be suspicious of notions that are strongly riveted without ever having been examined i indignantly reject the suspicion of prejudice im not speaking only for myself i know a club of extremely able men the freest from prejudice of any men alive who hate the notion of a god and im sure would be very able to untie this knot dion our narrator speaks up here remarking that alciphrons reliance on others is unworthy of him and of his principles as well as being a dangerous tactic crito then weighs in with scornful colourful offensive remarks about how freethinkers insincerely vary their standards of intellectual conduct according to what company they are in a nasty quarrel is in the making but alciphron calls a halt to this irksome and needless discourse he continues for my part i am a friend to inquiry i am willing that reason should have its full and free scope i build on no mans authority for my part denying a god doesnt serve my selfinterest in any way any man may believe or not believe a god as he pleases still euphranor must allow me to stare a little at his conclusions the conclusions are yours as much as mine for you were led to them by your own concessions you it seems stare to find that god is not far from every one of us and that in him we live and move and have our being acts first thing this morning you thought it strange that god should leave himself without a witness do you now think it strange that the witness should be so full and clear i must say i do i was aware of a certain metaphysical hypothesis to the effect that we see all things in god by the union of the human soul with the intelligible substance of the deity which neither i nor anyone else could make sense of this refers to a thesis of malebranches for sober hardthoughtout reasons he held that any ideas that come before our minds are literally godsnot ideas that he causes in us but ideas that he has himself in his mind the phrase intelligible substance of the deity is typical malebranchespeak but i never dreamed that anyone would claim that we see god with our own physical eyes as plainly as we see any human person whatsoever and that he daily speaks to our senses in a plain and clear dialect as for that metaphysical hypothesis i can make no more of it than you can but i think its clear that this optical language that euphranor has been describing has a necessary connection with knowledge wisdom and goodness it is equivalent to a constant creation indicating an immediate act of power and providence it cant be accounted for on mechanical principles by atoms or attractions or emanations of gases heres what we have the instantaneous production and reproduction of ever so many signscombined dissolved transposed diversified and adapted to an endless variety of purposesconstantly shifting in ways that are suitable to the circumstances incapable of being explained by the laws of motion chance fate or any other such blind source of energy this presents and testifies to the immediate operation of a spirit or thinking beinga wise good and provident spirit who directs and rules and governs the world some philosophers being convinced of the wisdom and power of the creator from the structure and workings of organic bodies and the orderly system of the world nevertheless thought that god left this system with all its parts and contents well adjusted and set in motion as an artisan leaves a clock to run on its own for a certain period but this visual language proves that there is not merely a creator but a caring governor who is actually and intimately present to us attentive to all our interests and to all our movements watching our conduct and attending to our minutest actions and designs throughout the whole course of our livesinforming scolding and directing us incessantly in a most evident and perceptible manner this is truly wonderful and isnt it amazing that men should be surrounded by such a wonder without reflecting on it theres something divine and admirable in this language addressed to our eyes something that may well awaken the mind and deserve its utmost attention it is learned with so little trouble it expresses the differences of things so clearly and aptly it instructs so quickly and clearly conveying by one glance a greater variety of bits of advice and a clearer knowledge of things than could be had from several hours of talk and along with informing it also amuses and entertains the mind with such unique pleasure and delight it is of excellent use in giving stability and permanence to human discourse in recording sounds and bestowing life on dead languages enabling us to write and read and thus to converse with men of remote ages and countries and it answers so precisely to our purposes and needs informing us more clearly about objects whose nearness and size make them likely to do the most harm or good to our bodies and less exactly in proportion as their smallness or distance from us makes them of less concern to us and yet men arent much impressed by these strange things but they arent strange theyre familiar and thats why they are overlooked things that rarely happen make an impression when they do whereas frequency lessens our admiration for things that may in themselves be ever so admirable so an ordinary person who isnt much given to thinking and meditating would probably be more convinced of the existence of a god by one single sentence heard once in his life coming down from the sky than by all the experience he has had of this visual language contrived with such exquisite skill so constantly addressed to his eyes and so plainly declaring the nearness wisdom and providence of the person who is addressing us but i still cant help wondering how men should be so little surprised or amazed by this visual faculty if it really is of such a surprising and amazing nature lets suppose a nation of men blind from birth among whom a stranger arrives the only sighted man in all the country lets suppose that this stranger travels with some of the natives and that he foretells that if they walk straight forward in half an hour theyll meet men or cattle or come to a house that if they make a right turn and then keep walking they will in a few minutes be in danger of falling down a precipice that by walking to the left they will in suchandsuch a time arrive at a river a wood or a mountain what do you think wouldnt they be infinitely surprised that someone who had never been in their country before knew it so much better than themselves and wouldnt those predictions seem to them as inexplicable and incredible as prophecy would to a minute philosopher i cant deny it but it seems to require intense thought to be able to sort out a prejudice that has been so long forming to get over the vulgar error of thinking there are ideas that are common to both senses and thus to be able to distinguish the objects of sight from those of touch these two kinds of objects haveif i may put it this wayblended together so intimately in our imagination that its extremely difficult for us to think ourselves into the precise state one of those men would be in if he were enabled to see but i believe it can be done and it might seem worth the trouble of a little thinking especially to men who are specially and intensively engaged in thinking unravelling prejudices and exposing mistakes i admit frankly that i cant find my way out of this mazeie i cant think myself into the frame of mind of the bornblind man who just begins to seeand i would be glad to be guided out of it by those who see better than i do crito quotes a biblical passage he is reminded of then a servant announces that tea is ready they go inside for it and find lysicles already there i am glad to have found my second said alciphron a fresh man to maintain our common cause which im sure lysicles will think has suffered through his absence why so i have been drawn into some concessions you wont like let me know what they are well that there is such a thing as a god and that his existence is very certain bless me how did you come to entertain such a wild idea well you know we claim to follow reason wherever it leads in brief i have been reasoned into it reasoned you should say baffled with words bewildered by sophistry would you like to hear the reasoning that led alciphron and me step by step so that we can examine whether or not it is sophistry im easy about that i can guess everything that can be said on that topic it will be my business to help my friend out whatever arguments drew him in will you admit the premises and deny the conclusions what if i admit the conclusion what will you grant that there is a god perhaps i may then we are agreed perhaps not o lysicles you are a subtle adversary i dont know what you are up to well the existence of god is basically an affair of little importance and a man may make this concession without yielding much what really matters is what sense the word god is to be given even the epicureans allowed that there are gods but then they were idle gods with no concern about human affairs hobbes allowed a corporeal god and spinoza held that the universe is god yet nobody doubts that these men were staunch freethinkers i could wish indeed that the word god were entirely dropped because in most minds it is coupled with a sort of superstitious awe the very root of all religion still i dont much mind if the name god is retained and the existence of god acceptedin any sense except that of a mind that knows everything and surveys human actionslike some judge or magistratewith infinite care and intelligence the belief in god in this sense fills a mans mind with worries puts him under constraints and embitters his very being but the belief in god in another sense can be free of anything much in the way of bad consequences i know this was the opinion of our great diagoras who told me he would never have taken the trouble to discover a demonstration that there is no god if the generally accepted notion of god had been the one that some of the church fathers and scholastics had and what was that well diagoras had discovered that once upon a time the deepest and most theoretically serious theologians found that they couldnt reconcile the attributes of god when taken in the ordinary sense or in any known sense with human reason and how the world shows itself to be so they adopted the doctrine that the words knowledge wisdom goodness and so on when applied to god must be understood in a quite different sense from what they mean in ordinary language and from anything that we can form a notion of or conceive this let them easily answer any objections that might be made against the attributes of god all they had to do was to deny that those attributes belonged to god in this or that or any known particular sense which amounted to denying that they belonged to him at all and by denying the attributes of god they in effect denied his existence though they may not have been aware of that heres an example suppose a man were to object that future contingencies are inconsistent with gods foreknowledge because certain knowledge of something that is uncertain is selfcontradictory the theologians i am talking about had an easy answer to ready at hand namely what you say may be true with respect to knowledge taken in the ordinary sense or in any sense that we can possibly form any notion of but theres no inconsistency between the contingent nature of things and divine foreknowledge taken to signify something of which we know nothingsomething that serves god in the way that what we understand by knowledge serves us the difference between these two is not one of quantity or degree of perfection they differ altogether totally in kind as light differs from sound actually they differ even more than that because light and sound are both sensations whereas knowledge in god has no sort of resemblance or agreement with any notion that man can form of knowledge the same can be said of all the other attributes which in this way can be equally reconciled with everything or with nothing any thinking person must see this is cutting knots rather than untying them for something cant be reconciled with the divine attributes when these attributes themselves are denied of god in every intelligible sense so that the very notion of god is taken away and nothing is left but the name without any meaning attached to it in short the belief that there is an unknown subject of attributes that are absolutely unknown is a very innocent doctrine which is why the acute diagoras who saw this was perfectly delighted with this system if this could once make its way and be accepted in the world diagoras said that would put an end to all natural or rational religion which is the basis of both the jewish and the christian religions for someone who comes to god or goes into the church of god must first believe that there is a god in some intelligible sense not merely that there is something in general without any proper notioneven a very inadequate oneof any of its qualities or attributes for this something in general could be fate or chaos or creative nature or anything else as well as it could be god and its no help to say there is something in this unknown being that is analogous to knowledge and goodness ie something that produces the effects that we cant conceive to be produced by men without knowledge and goodness for this is still to surrender to the atheist side against the theists the dispute has never been over whether there is a principle roughly something absolutely basic or primal a first cause because all philosophers right back to the presocratics have agreed that there is what they havent agreed about is whether these are true or false this principle is a thinking intelligent being the order beauty and usefulness that we see in natural effects couldnt be produced by anything but a mind or intelligence properly socalled the first cause must have had true real proper knowledge so we on the atheist side who think that all three are false will accept that all the natural effects that are vulgarly ascribed to knowledge and wisdom come from a being in which there is no knowledge or wisdom properly socalled at all but only something else that causes the things that men in their ignorance ascribe to what they call knowledge and wisdom and understanding you may be surprised to hear a man of pleasure like me philosophizing in this context but theres a lot to be gained from conversation with able men its a shortcut to knowledge and saves one from the drudgery of reading and thinking so now we have granted to you that there is a god in this indefinite sensewhat use can you make of this concession you cant argue from unknown attributes you cant prove that god should be loved for his goodness feared for his justice or respected for his knowledge we agree that all those consequences would follow from gods having goodness and the rest with those names taken in intelligible senses but we deny that any consequences follow from attributes admitted in no particular sense or in a sense that none of us understand thus since from such an account of god nothing can be inferred about conscience or worship or religion you are welcome to the account and so as not to stand out from the crowd well use the name god too and so snap theres an end of atheism this account of a deity is new to me i dont like it so ill leave it to be maintained by those who do its not new to me a while ago i heard a minute philosopher triumph on this very point and that set me to inquiring what basis there is for it in the church fathers or the scholastics crito now embarks on a long and learned lecture starting with the early history of this idea that knowledge etc are not to be applied to god in the same sense as they are to men just how early its start was is not clear because issues arise about the true authorship of various works it is clear that the thesis wasnt meant in the flatteningout way in which lysicles has understood it but rather than going into all those details we can safely jump ahead to this thomas aquinas expresses his sense of this matter as follows all perfections that created things get from god are also perfections of god in a certain higher sense which the scholastics express by saying that those perfections are in god eminently so whenever we attribute to god a perfection to which we give a name borrowed from that perfection in created things we must exclude from the names meaning everything that belongs to the imperfect way in which that attribute is found in created things from this he infers that knowledge in god is not a habit or disposition but a pure act and although suarez joins other scholastics in teaching that the mind of man conceives knowledge and will to be faculties or operations of god only by analogy to created things yet he plainly declares this not a quotation from him when it is said that knowledge is not properly in god this must be understood to be referring to knowledge including imperfection eg conceptual knowledge or some other imperfect kind of knowledge that created beings have none of those imperfections in the knowledge of men or angels is a feature of knowledge as such there can be knowledge that doesnt have them so from the premise that god doesnt have such imperfectionincluding knowledge it doesnt follow that knowledge in the proper sense of knowledge cant be attributed to god and of knowledge taken in a general way for the clear evident understanding of all truth he expressly affirms that this is in god and that this was never denied by any philosopher who believed in a god at that time the scholastics generally held that even being should be attributed to god and to created things only analogically that is they held that godthe supreme independent selfcausing cause and source of all beingsmustnt be supposed to exist in the same sense of exist as that in which created beings exist not that he exists less truly or properly than they do but only that he exists in a more eminent and perfect manner i wouldnt want anyone to be led through a misunderstanding of scholastics use of the terms analogy and analogical to the view that we cant get any distance towards forming a true and proper notion of attributes that we apply to god by analogy so let us look into the true sense and meaning of those words everyone knows that analogy is a greek word used by mathematicians to signify a likeness of proportions for example when we observe that two is to six as three is to nine this equality of proportion is called analogy and although the word proportion strictly signifies only the relation of one quantity to another in a looser derived sense it has been applied to signify every other kind of relational property and the term analogy has been broadened along with proportion so that now it signifies likeness or equality in respect of all relations or relational properties whatsoever and so we find the scholastics telling us there is an analogy between intellect and sight because intellect is to the mind what sight is to the body and that he who governs the state is analogous to him who steers a ship so that a monarch is analogically called a pilot being to the state what a pilot is to his vessel theres something else that may help to clear this matter up namely the scholastics distinction between two kinds of analogy metaphorical and proper the bible has plenty of examples of metaphorical analogy attributing human parts and passions to god when he is represented as having a finger an eye or an ear when he is said to repent to be angry or grieved everyone sees that the analogy is merely metaphorical such things as parts and passions properly understood essentially involve some imperfection so when it is said the finger of god appears in some event men of common sense mean only that the event in question is as truly ascribed to god as the works wrought by human fingers are ascribed to man and similarly with the rest the phrase the rest is berkeleys if it is meant to cover anger and grief as well as eyes and ears crito doesnt explain how but the case is different when wisdom and knowledge are attributed to god passions and senses as such involve defects but theres no defect in knowledge as such so it is all right to attribute knowledge to god therefore in the proper formal meaning of the word knowledge as long as it is attributed in a way that is proportional to gods infinite nature so we can say that just as god is infinitely above man so his knowledge is infinitely above mans thus this doctrine of analogical perfections in god or our knowing god by analogy seems to be misunderstood by those who infer from it that we cant form any direct or proper notion however inadequate of knowledge or wisdom as these occur in god and now gentlemen you may think i should ask your pardon for having dwelt so long its twice as long in the original on a point of metaphysics and introduced into good company such unpolished and unfashionable writers as the scholastics but lysicles gave me the opening so i leave him to answer for it i never dreamed of this dry lecture if i have opened up the discussion to these scholarly matters by my unfortunate mention of the scholastics it was my first fault of that kind and i promise it will be my last i dont enjoy involvement with crabbed authors of any sort its true that occasionally one finds a good idea in what we call dry writers an example was the idea i was speaking of which i must admit struck my fancy but for writers such as these we have the likes of prodicus and diagoras who read obsolete books and save the rest of us that trouble so you pin your faith on them only for some odd opinions and matters of fact and critical points but i could safely rely on them for more than that we know the men in whom we put our trust they are judicious and honest and have no aim except to get to the truth and im sure that some author or other has maintained the view i presented in the same sense as diagoras reported it that may be but it never was a generally accepted view and it never will be so long as men believe in a god that is because the same arguments that there was a first cause also prove that the first cause was intelligent using intelligent in its proper sense and also wise and good using those words too in their true and formal meanings but for your part alciphron you have been fully convinced that god is a thinking intelligent being in the same sense as other spirits though not in the same imperfect manner or degree well i do have some worries about that with knowledge you infer perhaps imply wisdom and with wisdom you infer goodness and i cant see that it is either wise or good to enact laws that cant ever be obeyed does anyone find fault with the exactness of geometrical rules because noone in practice can achieve it the perfection of a rule is useful even if it isnt reached many can approach something that noone actually reaches but how is it possible to conceive of god as so good when man is so wicked there is some plausibility perhaps to the idea that a little soft shadowing of evil sets off the bright and luminous parts of the creation and so contributes to the beauty of the whole piece here painting but you cant account in that way for such large black blots as those the world has that there should be so much vice and so little virtue on earth and that the laws of gods kingdom should be so poorly observed by his subjectsthats what cant be reconciled with the surpassing wisdom and goodness of the supreme monarch tell me alciphron would you argue that a state was ill administered or judge the manners of its citizens on the evidence of the disorders committed in the gaol or dungeon i would not well for all we know this spot with its few sinners may be as small a proportion of the universe of thinking beings as a dungeon is of a kingdom we seem to get our views not only from revelation but also from ordinary plain senseperception which leads us to infer by analogy with the world as we see it that there are innumerable orders of intelligent beings happier and more perfect than man our life is very short and this earthly globe where we live is a mere point in comparison with the whole system of gods creation we are indeed dazzled by the glory and grandeur of some things here below because we know no better but im inclined to believe that if we knew what it was to be an angel for one hour we would return to this worldeven to sit on the brightest throne in itwith vastly more loathing and reluctance than we would now descend into a loathsome dungeon or sepulchre to me it seems natural that such a weak passionate and shortsighted creature as man is always liable to worries of one kind or other but as hethis very same creatureis also apt to be overpositive in judging and overhasty in drawing conclusions these difficulties and doubts about gods conduct are turned into objections to his existence and so men end up arguing from their own defects against the divine perfections and although the views and temperaments of men are different and often opposite you can sometimes see them deduce the same atheistic conclusion from contrary premises two minute philosophers whom i know used to argue each from his own temperament against a providence caring god one of them a badtempered and vindictive man said that he couldnt believe in providence because london had not been swallowed up or consumed by fire from heaven the reason he gave was that the streets are full of people who show no belief in god or worship of him except perpetually praying that he would damn rot sink and confound them that sentence from perpetually to the end is as berkeley wrote it the original like this version seems to speak of people calling down gods wrath on themselves the other an idle goodtempered fellow concluded that there cant be such a thing as providence because an utterly wise being would have to have better things to do than attending to the prayers and actions and little interests of mankind after all if god has no passions how can it be true that vengeance is his or how can he be said to be jealous of his glory for i the lord thy god am a jealous god exodus in this context jealous of his glory means resentful of anything that denies or belittles his glory we believe that god executes vengeance without revenge and is jealous without weakness just as the mind of man sees without eyes and grasps without hands as when we say i see the flaw in your argument and i grasp the situation its time to end this part of the discussion so well grant that there is a god in this dispassionate sensebut then what of it what does this have to do with religion or divine worship what is the point of all these prayers and praises and thanksgivings and psalmsinging that the foolish vulgar call serving god what sense is there in all these things what use are they what are they for we worship god we praise and pray to him not because we think that he is proud of our worship or fond of our praise or prayers and affected by them as mankind are or because we think that our service can contribute in some measure to his happiness or good but because it is good for us to be disposed to relate in that way to god because our worship is just and right suitable to the nature of things and fitting to the way we relate to our supreme lord and governor if it is good for us to worship god it would seem that the christian religion which claims to teach men the knowledge and worship of god is of some use and benefit to mankind doubtless unless i am very much mistaken you wont be able to show that that is right it is now nearly dinnertime lets stop our conversation for now and pick it up again tomorrow morning fifth dialogue saturday dion reports that on the next morning friday the group walked to a charming spot in the countryside and were settling down for an allday conversation when they were interrupted by a clamour including the barking of hounds and the roaring of country squires it was a foxhunt in which one of the hunters had fallen from his horse and broken a rib the day was spent in getting him to critos home and caring for him there sending for a surgeon feeding the foxhunters who with loud rustic mirth gave proof of their religion and loyalty by the healths they drank and so on the following morning the discussiongroup returned to the place where they had been when the hunt and accident interrupted them now lysicles being a fastidiously elegant man and a witty one was utterly contemptuous of the rough manners and conversation of the foxhunters and was angry that he had lost so many hours in their company i cheered myself up he said by the thought that there were no longer any of this species among us meaning presumably moving in the social circles in which i move its strange that men should be entertained by such uncouth noise and hurry or find pleasure in the society of dogs and horses how much more elegant the diversions of the town are foxhunters replied euphranor in a certain way resemble freethinkers the foxhunters employ their animal faculties in pursuit of game and you gentlemen employ your intellectual faculties in the pursuit of truth its the same sort of pastime though the objects are different i would rather be compared to any brute on earth than a rational brute in this context rational is code for human lysicles is saying that he would rather be compared to subhuman animal than to a brutish human being such as a foxhunter that means that youd have been less displeased with my friend pythocles whom i have heard compare the common sort of minute philosophers not to the hunters but to the hounds he gave this reason youll often see among the dogs a loud babbler with a bad nose lead the unskilful part of the pack who all rush after him without following any scent of their own any more than the herd of freethinkers follow their own reason but pythocles was a blunt man and he cant ever have encountered such reasoners among the freethinkers as you gentlemen who can sit so long at an argument dispute every inch of ground and yet know when to make a reasonable concession i dont know how it happened but it seems that alciphron has been making concessions for me as well as for himself speaking for myself im not quite so ready to concede things but i dont want to be a standout either truly alciphron when i consider how far we have come and how far we are agreed i think its likely that well eventually come to be in complete agreement you have granted that a life of virtue is to be preferred as the kind of life most conducive both to the general good of mankind and to the good of individuals and you allow that the beauty of virtue isnt by itself a strong enough motive to get mankind to live virtuously this led you to agree that the belief in a god would be very useful in the world and that therefore you would be disposed to accept any reasonable proof of his existence such a proof has been given and you have accepted it well then if we admit a divinity why not divine worship and if worship why not religion to teach this worship and if some religion why not the christian one if we cant find a better one and christianity is already established by the laws of our country and handed down to us from our forefathers are we to believe in a god yet not pray to him for future benefits or thank him for past ones not trust in his protection or love his goodness or praise his wisdom or marvel at his power and if these things are to be done can we do them in any way that is more suitable to the dignity of god and man than the way laid down by the christian religion i am not perhaps altogether sure that religion must be absolutely bad for the public but i hate to see religion walk hand in hand with considerations of government and social order i dont like to see human rights tied to religion i am not in favour of any kind of governing high priest he reels off a list of countries that have had such i knew a witty freethinker hes dead now who was a great admirer of the ancient druids he detested the present established religion but used to say that he would like to see the druids and their religion restored as it flourished in gaul and britain in ancient times it would be a good thing he thought that there should be a number of thoughtful men set apart to preserve knowledge of arts and sciences to educate youth and to teach men the immortality of the soul and the moral virtues that is what the ancient druids did he said and id be glad to see them once more established among us how would you like it alciphron that priests should have power to decide all controversies settle disputes about property distribute rewards and punishments that anyone who didnt submit to their decrees should be excommunicated regarded with disgust excluded from all honours and privileges and deprived of the common benefit of the laws and that from time to time a number of laymen should be crammed together in a wickerwork idol and burned to death as an offering to their pagan gods how would you like living under such priests and such a religion not at all such a state of affairs would be utterly unacceptable to freethinkers but thats what the druids and their religion were like if we can trust cæsars account of them im now more than ever convinced that there ought to be no such thing as an established religion of any kind certainly all the nations of the world have until now been out of their wits even the atheniansthe wisest and freest people on earthhad whoknowswhat foolish attachment to their established church they offered it seems a monetary reward to whoever would kill diagoras of melos a freethinking contemporary who laughed at their mysteries and protagoras another of the same sort narrowly escaped being put to death for writing something that seemed to contradict their accepted notions of the gods thats how our noble sect was treated in ancient athens and i have no doubt that your druids would have sacrificed many a holocaust berkeleys word of freethinkers i wouldnt give a farthing to exchange one religion for another away with them all together root and branch anything less than that isnt worth doing no druids or priests of any sort for me i see no place in the world for any of them this reminds me of how we ended our last philosophical conversation we agreed that next time we would return to the point we had then just begun on namely the use or benefit of the christian religion which alciphron challenged crito to show im all the readier to take this up because i dont think it is hard to do one great mark of christianitys truth is in my view its tendency to do good it seems to be the north star a principal guide to navigation at sea that guides all our judgments about practical matters including moral ones because these are always connected with universal benefit but to think straight about this matter we should try to do what lysicles did in an earlier conversation see pages taking account of things as a whole going as far as we possibly can in seeing how principles branch out into consequences in its four occurrences in this paragraph principle means source or seed see euphranor on pages we neednt pay much attention to the moods or whims or imaginary distresses of a few idle men whose ideas may be offended though their conscience cant be wounded what we have to do is to consider fairly the true interests of individuals as well as of human society now as is evident to anyone who gets his notion of it from the gospel the christian religion is a fountain of light joy and peace a source of faith hope and charity so it has to be a principle of happiness and virtue youd have to be blind not to see that destroying the principles of good actions must destroy good actions as for someone who sees this and yet persists in trying to destroy the principlesif he isnt wicked who is it seems to me that any man who can see in some depth and some breadth must be aware of his own misery sinfulness and dependence perceive that this present world is not designed or adapted to make rational souls happy welcome the chance to get into a better state and be overjoyed to find that the road leading to that better state involves loving god and man practising every virtue living reasonably while we are here on earth proportioning the value we put on things to the value they actually have and using this world without misusing it thats what christianity requires it doesnt require the cynics nastiness or the numbness of the stoic can there be a higher ambition than to overcome the world or a wiser ambition than to subdue ourselves or a more comfortable doctrine than the forgiveness of sins or a more joyful prospect than that of having our low nature renovated and assimilated to the deity our being made fellowcitizens with angels and sons of god did pythagoreans or platonists or stoics ever propose to the mind of man purer means or a nobler end how much of our happiness depends on hope how totally is hope extinguished by the minute philosophy on the other hand how it is cherished and raised by the gospel let anyone who thinks seriously consider these things and then say which he thinks deserves better of mankindhe who recommends christianity or he who runs it down which does he think is likelier to lead a happy life to be a hopeful son an honest dealer a worthy patriothe who sincerely believes the gospel or he who doesnt believe a word of ithe who aims at being a child of god or he who is content to be known as one of epicuruss hogs just look at the characters and behaviour of average examples of the two sorts of men and then say which sort live in a way that accords best with the dictates of reason the preparer of this text asked anthony long uc berkeley for help with epicuruss hogs and this was part of his reply included with permission in the last verse of horaces little epistle to tibullus he describes himself to his fellow poet as a hog from epicuruss herd in his selfmocking context horace says that he has been observing the epicurean rule of living carefree for the day when you want to laugh you will see me sleek and fat in fine shape a hog horace knows that the true epicurean is not a voluptuary but he ironically echoes that stock prejudice its amazing to see how different things look when they are viewed in different lights or by different eyes the picture i have of religion is very unlike yours crito when i consider how it unmans the soul filling it with absurd dreams and slavish fears how it extinguishes the gentle passions inspiring a spirit of malice and rage and persecution when i see bitter resentments and unholy wrath in the very men who preach meekness and charity to others perhaps gentlemen of your sect think that religion is a subject beneath their attention but it seems to me that someone who sets about opposing any doctrine ought to know what he is opposing so ill tell you religion is the virtuous mean between disbelief and superstition we dont defend superstitious follies or the rage of bigots what we plead for is religion against irreligion law against confusion virtue against vice the hope of a christian against the despondency of an atheist i wont defend bitter resentments and unholy wrath in any man much less in a christian and least of all in a clergyman but if even the best christians sometimes produce outbursts of angry emotion that wont surprise anyone who reflects on the sarcasms and rudeness with which christians are treated by the minute philosophers for as cicero remarks somewhere an insult has a sting that a wise and good man will find it hard to bear he says it in latin but even if you sometimes see particular selfprofessed christians going to faulty extremes of any kind through passion and weakness while unbelievers of a calmer and cooler temperament sometimes behave better this contrast proves nothing in favour of disbelief or against christianity if a believer acts badly that is because of the man not of his belief and if an unbeliever does good that is because of the man not of his unbelief you wont deny that the clergy are regarded as physicians of the soul and that religion is a sort of medicine that they deal in and administer well now if very many souls are diseased and lost how can we think that their the physician is skillful or that his medicine is good its a common complaint that vice increases and men grow more wicked by the day if a shepherds flock is diseased or unsound who is to blame but the shepherd for neglecting them or not knowing how to cure them i have nothing but contempt for such shepherds such medicine and such physicians who do what all hucksters douse grave and elaborate speeches to peddle their pills to the people who are never the better for them it seems utterly reasonable to say that we should base our judgment of a physician and his medicine on the medicines effect on the sick but tell me lysicles would you judge a physician by the sick who take his medicine and follow his prescriptions or by those who dont doubtless by those who do well then what are we to say if great numbers of sick people refuse to take the medicine and instead of it take poison of a directly opposite nature that has been prescribed by others whose concern it is to discredit the physician and his medicines to block men from using them and to destroy their effect by drugs of their own is the physician to blame for the health troubles of those people by no means by the same line of argument doesnt it follow that the tendency of religious doctrines should be judged by the effects they produce not on all who hear them but only on those who accept or believe them it seems so if we are to be fair then shouldnt we judge the effects of religion by the religious of faith by believers of christianity by christians but i suspect there are very few of these sincere believers still wont it suffice to justify our principles if in proportion to the numbers who accept them and the strength of the faith with which they are accepted they produce good effects there may be more such believers than you think and if there arent isnt that the fault of those who make it their proclaimed purpose to lessen that number and who are those but the minute philosophers i say it is owing to the clergy themselves to the wickedness and corruption of clergymen and who denies that there may be minute philosophers even among the clergy in such a numerous a body there are bound to be men of all sorts but despite the cruel reproaches flung at the clergy by their enemies i think that any fairminded observer of men and things will be inclined to regard those reproaches as revealing faults in those who fling them as much as in the clergy at whom they are flungespecially if he takes into account the strident tone of those who censure the clergy i dont know enough of the world to claim to judge the virtue merit and wideranging accomplishments of men in the various professions and anyway i dont like the odious work of comparison but im willing to say this the clergy in this region where i live are by no means a disgrace to it on the contrary the people seem to profit greatly from their example and doctrine but supposing the clergy to be sinners and faulty as of course all men certainly are supposing you could detect here and there among them great crimes and vices what inference can you draw against the profession itself from its unworthy practitioners any more than the pride pedantry and bad lives of some philosophers creates a case against philosophy or those of lawyers a case against law it is certainly right to judge principles from their effects but then we must know them to be effects of those principles its precisely the method i have followed with respect to religion and the minute philosophy i can honestly say that i never knew any man or family become worse in proportion as they became religious but i have often observed that minute philosophy is the worst thing that can get into a family the easiest way to impoverish divide and disgrace it what i have observed by this same method of tracing causes from their effects is that the love of truth virtue and the happiness of mankind are good stuff for speeches but they arent what drive the clergy in their work if they were why would clergymen beas they all areso fond of abusing human reason disparaging natural religion and trashing the philosophers and scientists not all its true that a christian favours confining reason within its proper bounds but so does every reasonable man if we are forbidden to get involved with unprofitable questions empty philosophy and science that isnt really science it doesnt follow that all inquiries into profitable questions useful philosophy and real science are unlawful no man of good sense will make those inferences it is generally acknowledged that there is a natural religion that can be discovered and proved by the light of reason to those who are capable of such proofs but still it has to be admitted that precepts and oracles from heaven are incomparably better suited to the improvement of ordinary folk and the good of society than are the reasonings of philosophers thats why we dont find that natural or rational religion ever became the popular national religion of any country it cant be denied that in all heathen countries a world of fables and superstitious rites have been accepted under the colour of religion but i question whether they were as absurd and harmful as they are vulgarly said to have been because their respective legislators and magistrates see note on page must surely have thought them useful we dont deny that there was something useful in the old religions of rome and greece and some other pagan countries on the contrary we freely admit that they had some good effects on the people but these good effects came from the truths contained in those false religionsthe more truth a religion contained therefore the more useful it was i think youll have difficulty producing any useful truth any moral precept any healthy principle or notion in any nonchristian system of religion or philosophy that isnt included in the christian religion where it is either enforced by stronger motives or supported by better authority or carried to a higher point of perfection so you want us to think ourselves a finer people than the ancient greeks or romans if by finer you mean better perhaps we are and if we arent its not because we have the christian religion but because too many of us dont alciphron protests that critos perhaps we are is indefensible he contrasts cicero and brutus with an english patriot and seneca with one of our parsons crito replies that those great men were not the minute philosophers of their times and that the best of their principles were also christian ones he adds that the current standing of some of the great men of the ancient world is partly due to their undeniable personal merits partly to favourable publicity and not at all to their not being christian as for more recent times a careful look shows a great deal of moral improvement in europe under the influence of christianity for a start he says lets take a look at england i have heard much of the glorious light of the gospel and would be glad to see some effects of it in my own dear countrywhich is incidentally one of the most corrupt and profligate on earth despite the boasted purity of our religion but you wouldnt be showing much confidence in your religion if you compared it only with that of the barbarous heathen from whom we are derived if you want to honour your religion have the courage to make your comparison with the most renowned heathens of antiquity it is a common prejudice to despise the present and overrate remote times and things theres a touch of this in the judgments men make concerning the ancient greeks and romans those nations certainly did produce some noble spirits and great patterns of virtue but overall they seem to me to have been much inferior in real virtue and good morals to our corrupt and profligate nation so you called it to bring dishonour to our religion i wonder how you would choose to describe it when you wanted to do honour to the minute philosophy crito backs up his statement about the greeks and romans by citing examples the treatment of slaves and prisoners of war killing of unwanted children gladiators and also bacchanals and unbridled lusts of every kind these dont have parallels in contemporary england he says largely because of christianity alciphron replies that crito is overlooking facts that dont fit his views citing the inhumanity of that barbarous custom of duelling crito agrees that duelling is bad i shant make an apology for every goth that walks the streets with a determined purpose to murder any man who spits in his face or calls him a liar he goes on to say that christianity isnt responsible for this and alciphron says that thats irrelevant to the immediate present topic which is just a comparison of contemporary england with ancient greece and rome crito accepts this and returns to the comparison they were making saying that duelling isnt as bad as the common roman practice of poisoning thats very true duelling is not as general a nuisance as poisoning and its not so low either this crime if it is a crime has a good chance of holding on despite the law and the gospel the clergy never preach against it because they dont suffer from it personally and a man of honour mustnt appear to oppose the means of vindicating honour which is what duelling is you arent the first freethinker to say that the clergy are not given to preaching against duelling but in my view that remark itself is unfair and so is your statement about why the clergy stay away from this topic in effect half of their sermonsall that is said about charity brotherly love forbearance meekness and forgiving injuriesis directly against this wicked custom of duelling as for the claim that they never suffer from it themselves that is so far from true that one can make a case for saying that they suffer from it oftener than other men how can you make good on that claim the ferocity of this passage suggests that it reflects berkeleys own personal experiences of being bullied by cowards there are two kinds of bully the fighting and the tame both public nuisances the fighting bully is the more dangerous animal but there are far fewer of them than of tame bullies the tame bully exerts his talents against clergymen which the fighting bully never does the qualities of a man that make him count as a tame bully are natural rudeness combined with a delicate sense of dangermeaning danger to himself you see the fashionable custom of calling men to account for their behaviour ie challenging them to a duel has not lessened the force of inbred insolence and bad manners it has merely turned that force in a new direction so you can often see one of these tame bullies nearly bursting with offended pride and bad temper that he dares not express openly because he is afraid of being challenged to a duel until a parson comes his way providing reliefie giving his angry state a safe outlet but to return to our topic can you deny that the ancient romans were as famous for justice and integrity as todays men are for the opposite qualities you cant get the character of the romans from the opinions of cicero the actions of cato or a few shining episodes scattered through their history what you need to consider is the prevailing tenor of their lives and notions and then he says the picture changes and he goes on to cite examples of atrocious publicly approved conduct by the romans then i venture to say that if you take roman history from one end to the other and impartially compare it with our own you wont find the romans to be as good as you imagine or your countrymen to be as bad on the contrary i really do think that an unbiased eye will detect a vein of charity and justicean effect of christian principlesrunning through england today crito paused and alciphron spoke up addressing himself to euphranor and me it is natural for men according to their various upbringings and prejudices to form opposite judgments about the same things crito for instance imagines that religion has only salutary effects but if you appeal to the general experience and observation of other men youll find that the statement tantum religio potuit suadere malorum has grown into a proverb which says that religion is the root of evil it was said by lucretius and wasnt a generalization about religion speaking of agamemnons sacrifice of his daughter to a goddess in the hope of getting favourable winds for his attack on troy lucretius wrote so greatly was religion able to persuade a man to do evil not just among epicureans or other ancient heathens but among moderns speaking of the christian religion i think it is unreasonable to set up against the general concurring opinion of the world the observation of a particular person or a particular set of zealots whose prejudice sticks close to them and keeps mixing in with their judgmentszealots who read draw conclusions and observe with an eye not to discovering the truth but to defending their prejudice notice how nasty the tone has become this is said about crito in his presence but not addressed to him directly although i cant share alciphrons views i admire his skill and dexterity in argument sometimes he represents an opinions acceptance by people in general as a sure sign of its being wrong but when that doesnt suit his purposes he just as easily makes it a sure sign of truth but the fact that an irreligious proverb is used by the friends and admired authors of a minute philosopher doesnt imply that the proverb is something generally accepted still less that it is a truth based on the experience and observation of mankind and this one isnt a truth it would be as reasonable to think that darkness is a natural effect of sunshine as to think that sullen and furious passions come from the glad tidings and divine precepts of the gospel the sum and substance the scope and end of christs religion is the love of god and man all other doctrines and duties whether legal or moral are subordinate to this as parts of it means to it signs of it principles arising from it motives to adhere to it or effects of it tell me now how could evil or wickedness of any kind comes from such a source i dont say that there are no evil qualities in christians or that there are no good ones in minute philosophers but i do say this whatever evil there is in us our principles certainly lead to good and whatever good there may be in you it is most certain that your principles lead to evil it must be admitted that christianity looks handsome on the outside and many plausible things can be said in favour of the christian religion taken simply as we find it in the gospel he goes on to report the view of one of our great writers shaftesbury that the first christian preachers sneakily made christianity look goodall love charity meekness patience and so forthuntil they had converted much of the world and come to have political power and then they soon changed their appearance and showed cruelty ambition avarice and every bad quality crito responds that this is very stupid the first christian preachers died for their faith and yet ever since this religion has appeared in the world we have had eternal feuds factions massacres and wars the very reverse of that hymn with which it is introduced in the gospel glory be to god on high on earth peace goodwill towards men crito accepts this adds that christianity was often the pretext for these evils but insists that this doesnt mean it was their cause he then says that the evils of the christian era were matched and outnumbered by evils in prechristian times all these evils early and late were the common product of the passions and vices of mankind which are sometimes covered with the mask of religion by wicked men who have the form of godliness without the power of it this is so obviously true that im surprised that any man of sense knowledge and candour can doubt it he returns to ancient rome with more examples of horrors alciphron agrees that the romans had a high and fierce spirit which produced very bloody catastrophes but the ancient greeks he says were a civilized and gentle sort of men softened by arts and philosophy crito replies that the little states and cities of greece as alciphron calls them had their factions which persecuted each other with such treachery rage and malice that our factious folk are mere lambs by comparison for evidence of this he refers to thucydides history of the war between athens and sparta and he expresses contempt for freethinkers divers to the bottom of things fair inquirers and openers of eyes who are capable of such a gross mistake as sentimentalising ancient greece the rest of mankind we could more easily give up but as for the greeks men of the most refined genius express a high esteem of them not only on account of the qualities that you think fit to allow them but also for their virtues on the basis of the fullest and fairest observation i can make i think that if virtue stands for truth justice and gratitude there is incomparably more virtue right now in england than could ever be found in ancient greece he goes on about the ingratitude that some greek states showed to some of their citizens who had been benefactors and then moves on to this as for the source of the chief advantage of the greeks and romans and other nations that have made the greatest figure in the world im inclined to think it was their special reverence for the laws and institutions of their countries these inspired them with steadiness and courage and with the heartfelt and noble love of their country and what they understood to be their country was not confined by language or ethnic origin still less by geographical location their notion of their country also took in a certain system of manners customs notions rites and civil and religious laws i can see your drift you want us to revere the laws and religious institutions of our country well excuse us if we dont see fit to imitate the greeks or to be governed by any authority whatsoever im sure you dont if islam were established by law i dont doubt that the freethinkersthe very ones who applaud turkish maxims and manners so loudly that youd think they were ready to turn turkishwould be the first to protest against them but to return to our topic i agree that there always have been wars and factions in the world and that there always will be on some pretext or other as long as men are men but theres a specifically christian sort of war and sort of warrior one that the heathens had no notion of the noun divine has been replaced by theologian in this version but its occurrence in this paragraph and the next is left unaltered for reasons that youll see im talking about disputes in theology the wars and polemical divines the warriors which the world has been amazingly pestered with if you take their word for it they are teaching peace meekness harmony and whatnot but even a cursory look at how they behave shows them to have been all through the centuries the most contentious quarrelsome disagreeing crew that ever appeared on earth the skill and trickery the zeal and eagerness with which the scholastic divines those barbarians split hairs and quarrel over nonexistent imagined things is more absurd and a greater scandal to human reason than all the ambitious intrigues plots and politics of the court of ancient rome and makes me even angrier than those do if divines are quarrelsome its not because they are divine but because they are undivine and unchristian justice is a good thing and so is the art of healing yet men can be wronged in the administering of justice or poisoned in the giving of medicine but just as wrong cant be justice or an effect of justice and poison cant be medicine or an effect of medicine so also pride or strife cant be religion or an effect of religion having said that i agree that you can often see hotheaded bigots signing up with religious parties as well as political ones without being of credit or service to either for the next bit you need to remember that the scholastics were roman catholic philosophical theologians while berkeley was an anglican as for the scholastics in particular i dont think the christian religion has any need to defend them their doctrines or their method of handling them still however futile their views may be and however clumsy their language its simply not true that they sneer and scold and rant in their writings and they are so far from showing fury or passion that an impartial judge might rate them far ahead of the minute philosophers in keeping close to the point and in their tone and good manners but anyway if men are puzzled tangle with one another talk nonsense and quarrel about religion they do the same about law medicine politics and everything else that matters its not just in divinity that men run into disputes trickery nonsense and contradictions it also happens in the other professions i have mentioned and indeed in any pursuit where men have created abstract theory but this doesnt stop there being many excellent rules sound ideas and useful truths in all those professions in all disputes human emotions too often get stirred into the mix in proportion as the subject is thought to be more or less important but we oughtnt to confuse the cause of man with the cause of god or make human follies an objection to divine truths its easy to distinguish what looks like wisdom from above from what comes from the passion and weakness of men the distinction is so obvious that when someone doesnt draw it one might be tempted to think that this is a result not of ignorance but of something worse the hostile tone isnt improving the conduct we cite in objections to minute philosophers is a natural consequence of their principles anything they can cite in objections to us is an effect not of our principles but of human passion and frailty oh terrific so we must no longer cite in objections against christians the absurd contentions of councils the cruelty of inquisitions the ambition and powergrabbing of churchmen you can cite them as objections against christians but not against christianity if the divine author of our religion and his disciples have sowed a good seed and if together with this good seed the enemies of his gospel including the minute philosophers of all ages have sowed bad seeds from which weeds and thistles grow isnt it obvious that these bad weeds cant be blamed on the good seed or on those who sowed it he develops this point at considerable and not very interesting length alciphron responds by shifting to a different complaint the triviality and unimportance of much theological writing i shant undertake to vindicate theological writings as such a general defence of them would be as needless as a general accusation is groundless but let them speak for themselves and dont condemn them on the word of a minute philosopher anyway lets look at the worst case imagine a quarrelsome pedant in divinity who disputes and ruminates and writes on some refined point that is as useless and unintelligible as you please but then ask yourself what would have become of this man if he had been brought up to be a layman rather than a cleric mightnt he have employed himself in shifty business deals harassing lawsuits factions seditions and such like amusements doing much more harm to the public than he actually does with his useless theological studies the two pages between here and occupy five pages in the original they arent of much philosophical interest alciphron complains that in theological disputes what men lack in light they commonly make up in heat crito replies that in any branch of study when some isolated point is being looked into with great care that tends to generate an inflated sense of its importance but this is routine stuff and not special to theology alciphron complains that trivial theological squabbles are regarded as learning and the public takes an interest in them as though they were sporting events he objects to theological writings on stylistic grounds what man of sense or breeding would not detest the infection of longwinded pulpit eloquence or of that dry formal pedantic stiff and clumsy style that smells of the lamp and the college those who are foolish enough to admire the universities as centres of learning must think that my reproach smells of the college is a strange one but it is perfectly fair these days the ablest men agree that the universities are merely hotbeds of prejudice corruption barbarism and pedantry speaking for myself i find no fault with universities all i know is that i had three hundred pounds a year to spend in one of them and it was the happiest time of my life as for their books and style of writingi didnt have time to pay any attention to them whoever wants to pull weeds will never lack work theres no shortage of bad books on every subject i dont know what theological writings alciphron and his friends are familiar with but i venture to say that our english theologians include many writers who for breadth of learning solidity of content strength of argument and purity of style are not inferior to any writers in our language as for our universities which are of course imperfect any impartial observer will find that with all their flaws they are better than universities in other countries and much better than the mean picture that minute philosophers draw of them its natural that the loudest complaints against places of education come from those who have profited least by them crito mistakes the point i am relying on the authority not of a dunce or a rake or an absurd parent examples that crito has used but of the most accomplished critic this age has produced this great man characterizes men of the church and universities with the finest touches and most masterly pencil what do you think he calls them what why the black tribe magicians formalists pedants bearded boys and after having sufficiently derided and exploded them and their mean and crude learning he provides the most admirable models of good writing namely his own writings they have to be acknowledged as the finest things in our languageas i could easily convince you for i also have with me something by that noble writer after an exchange about a noble writer who is also a nobleman in fact shaftesbury alciphron takes a book from his pocket and starts to read a long flowery unclear passage in which idleness is praised as being better than busy greed it is quoted verbatim from shaftesburys book characteristics of etc except that berkeley mischievously puts it on the page as fifty lines blank verse of which this is typical but here a busy form solicits us active industrious watchful and despising pains and labour she wears the serious countenance of virtue but with features of anxiety and disquiet what ist she mutters what looks she on with such admiration and astonishment and so on until euphranor interrupts with a protest why should we interrupt our discussion to read a play it isnt a play or poetry alciphron replies but a famous modern critic moralizing in prose he goes on about this great mans discoveries and his writings euphranor comments sarcastically on the kind of man who offers to reform the style and taste of the age and alciphron not hearing the sarcasm continues enthusiastically about the admired critic of our times who has among other things argued that shakespeare milton and others have been greatly overrated euphranor asks what effect this great man has had on the public do they aspire to his sublimity or imitate his chaste unaffected style alciphron still naively enthusiastic says that the taste of the age is much mended crito gets in a slap at the writingstyle of minute philosophers and then shifts the conversation back towards where it was a few minutes ago when your great man tells us that ignorance and ill taste are due to the christian religion or the clergy i cant just take his word for it the truth is the opposite of that crito says in a speech that is summed up in this everyone who knows anything knows that we are indebted for our learning to the greek and latin tongues and that we are indebted for those tongues to our religion what else could have made foreign and dead languages in such demand among us alciphron speaks harshly of one sort of learning that is undoubtedly of christian origin and special to the universitieshe deplores the years that young people waste in acquiring the mysterious jargon of scholasticism and the further years they have to spend being untaught it by the world but what if this scholastic learning was not of christian but of moslem origin being derived from the arabs and what if this complaint about gentlemens spending several years in learning and unlearning this jargon is just a sham and this is said sarcastically a specimen of the truth and candour of certain minute philosophers surely it wouldnt be such a deplorable loss of time if a young gentleman spent a few months on the much despised and decried art of logica surplus of logic is by no means the prevailing nuisance of this age it is one thing to waste ones time learning and unlearning the barbarous terms ultrafine distinctions and longwinded sophistry of the scholastics its another to attain some exactness in defining and arguingthings that may be not altogether beneath the dignity even of a minute philosopher logic used to be regarded as its own objectie a selfsufficient subject all on its ownso that the art of reasoning instead of being transferred to things was aimed only at words and abstractions which produced a sort of leprosy in all branches of knowledge but those times are past and logiconce cultivated as the chief branch of knowledgeis now considered in another light it doesnt play anything like the part in the studies of young gentlemen at the universities that is attributed to it by those admirable reformers of religion and learning the minute philosophers crito goes on to say that the restoration of arts and civilized learning has been due to the influence of christians whom he names at length in the course of this he speaks of the great scholars who flourished on the other side of the alps in the golden age as the italians call it of pope leo the tenth and alciphron challenges this saying that the noble critic from whom he quoted a few minutes ago regards the italians as corrupters of true learning and erudition crito replies with some slighting remarks about the noble critic and surprisingly lysicles backs him up saying in effect that someone who writes so much about art and taste and critical skill oughtnt to write as badly as that man shaftesbury does in the course of some further skirmishing between alciphron and crito about whether and to what extent english culture is indebted to church or universities or ancient languages crito speaks of christianity as a generator of arts and sciences and also of the general sense of virtue and humanity and the belief in a providence and afterlife which all the argumentation of minute philosophers has not yet been able to abolish that remark brings the topic of christianityandculture to an end because alciphron replies it is strange that you still persist in arguing as though all the gentlemen of our sect were enemies to virtue and downright atheists when i have assured you that on the contrary we have among us a number of people who announce their support for virtue and natural religion and i have also assured you that i myself now argue on that basis how can you claim to support natural religion and yet be open enemies of christianity which is the only established religion that includes whatever is excellent in natural religion and which is the only means of making those precepts duties and notions become reverenced throughout the world suppose someone tried to persuade people that he was greatly in support of a particular earthly monarch that he loved and admired his government while at the same time he took every opportunity to express himself as a most bitter enemy of the very persons and methods that contributed most to the monarchs service and to making his dignity known and revered his laws observed or his dominion extendedwouldnt such a person be thought weak or insincere and isnt this just what minute philosophers like you do announce themselves as advocates of god and religion and yet do all they can to discredit christians and their worship admittedly you argue against christianity in one way that doesnt necessarily express hostility to religion as such namely by representing christianity as the cause of evil and wickedness in the world but that line of argument could be used with equal force against civil government food and drink every faculty and profession learning eloquence and even against human reason itself and even those of your sect who allow themselves to be called deists if their views are thoroughly examined will be found to include little religion in them as for gods providence watching over our conduct and dispensing blessings or hardships the immortality of the soul the last judgment and an afterlife with rewards and punishments those are great points of natural religion but how few if any of your freethinkers have tried to get men to have a serious sense of them how many go the opposite way trying to make the belief in them shaky or ridiculous when a mans declared principles and personal beliefs are utterly subversive of the things listed above anything he says about virtue piety and religion will be understood as merely playing safe and not being conspicuous frankly i have never had any liking for religion of any kind revealed or unrevealed whats unrevealed is natural religion and i venture to say the same for any gentlemen of our sect that i am acquainted with having never known any of them do anything as low as use the word god with reverence or express respect for piety or for any sort of worship he adds details about ways in which a minute philosopher may talk as though he had respect for christianity explaining that this is never to be taken seriously and literally then after all these arguments and ideas that beget one another without end here is my view in a nutshell my friends and i cant for the life of us see why man mightnt do very well and govern himself without any religion at all brutes do it and they are thought to be less capable than men you say that brutes have instincts senses appetites and passions to steer and conduct them well men have all those and also have reason that they can consult when they need to from these premises my friends and i conclude the road of human life is well enough lit without religion brutes dont have much power of thought and it is confined to particular things that are present to the animal so they are sufficiently restrained and kept in order by the force or faculties of other animals and by the skill of man and conscience and religion dont come into this in contrast with that human reason is a faculty of vast extent and power especially power to do mischief and conscience is a necessary balance to it and another point by the law of their nature nonhuman animals are pushed to one particular end or manner of existence without inclination or means either to deviate from that or to go beyond it but man has in him a will and higher principle through which he can pursue different or even contrary ends and he can fall short of or exceed the perfection natural to his species in this world just as he can either hand over control to his sensual appetites thereby degrading himself into the condition of brutes or else wellorder and improve his mind thereby upgrading himself into something resembling an angel man is the only animal with enough understanding to know his god whats the use of this knowledge if it isnt to ennoble man to raise him to a level where he is more like god and more in touch with god and what would the good of such ennoblement be if it ended with this life and how can these things happen without religion but we have already discussed at great length the topics of vice and virtue man and beast sense and intellect lysicles surely you dont want us to go back to where we were three or four days ago by no means i would much rather go forward and make an end as soon as possible but to save us all trouble let me tell you once for all that whatever you say youll never persuade me that so many able and agreeable men are in the wrong and a pack of snarling sour bigots in the right o lysicles i dont look for religion among bigots or for reason among libertines each kind disgrace their respective positionsthe bigot exerting an angry zeal for things that hardly matter and the libertine paying no attention to even the plainest and most important truths and surely whatever there is thats silly narrow and uncharitable in the bigot the same is in great measure to be attributed to the conceited ignorance and petulant irreligion of the libertine lysicles ignored this and rounded on alciphron i have always thought he said that nothing could be sillier than to think of destroying christianity by praising natural religion you cant consistently think well of one and poorly of the other because its obvious that natural religion needs the help of revealed religion if it is ever to be established and accepted anywhere except in the brains of a few idle speculative men i knew what your concessions would come to anyone with half an eye can see that the belief in god virtue an afterlife and such fine notions are the very basis and cornerstone of the christian religion give them this foundation to build on and youll soon see what superstructures our theologians will raise from it admit the truth and importance of those doctrines and you dont have to be a conjurer to prove from that the excellence and usefulness of the christian religion and then of course there must be priests to teach and propagate this useful religion and if there are priests provision will have to made for their maintenance enabling them to perform all their rites and ceremonies in a decent fashion and to keep their sacred character respected and the plain upshot of all this is that the monarch will ally himself with the priesthood in order to subdue the people so we have opened the gates to a long procession of ecclesiastical evils priestcraft hierarchy inquisition we have lost our liberty and property the nation has been put to vast expense simply to purchase bridles for our mouths and saddles for our backs he said this with some sharpness of tone and a scolding manner alciphron was upset but said nothing and showed confusion in his looks crito looked at euphranor and me with a smile then looking over at the two philosophers he said if youll allow me to intervene to prevent a rupture between old friends and brethren in opinion i would remark that in what lysicles has just said there is something right and something wrong it seems right to assert as he does that a real belief in natural religion will lead a man to approve of revealed religion but it is wrong to say that inquisitions tyranny and ruin must follow from this your freethinkersno offence meantseem to mistake where their strength lies they imagine strongly but reason weakly they are mighty in exaggeration but thin in argument isnt there some way to relieve them from the terror of that fierce and bloody animal an english parson wont it be enough to trim his talons without chopping off his fingers then they are such wonderful defenders of liberty and property he tells an antipope story to illustrate his thesis that we may see every day both things and notions being attributed to liberty and property that in fact dont have and arent meant to have anything to do with either of them really is it impossible for a man to be a christian without being a slave or to be a clergyman without having the principles of an inquisitor i am far from shielding and justifying the greed for domination or tyrannical power in ecclesiastics some who have been guilty of that have paid dearly for it and it is to be hoped they always will but once we have calmed the fury and folly of the ambitious bishop isnt it time to look see whether some evil mightnt come to the state from a different sourcethe overflowing zeal of an independent whig ie a believer in primitive christianity who is opposed to the established church of england ill tell you this without bothering to prove it the worst tyranny this nation ever felt was from the hands of patriots of that kind i dont know tyranny is a harsh word and is sometimes misapplied when spirited men with independent views create a ferment or make a change in the state those who lose by the changes are apt to consider things in one light and those who win to consider them in another in the mean time this is certainly good policy we should be sparing with our money and keep it for better uses than to spend on the church and religion what follows is a longish discussion of propertyrights the legal basis for the ownership of land by the church and so on then i can never hope crito to make you think that my schemes are reasonable you and i each argue correctly on our own principles and well never agree until we drop our principles and that cant be done by reasoning we all talk of just and right and wrong and public good and so on we use the same names but our notions and conclusions are very different perhaps diametrically opposite and yet the conclusions on each side may admit of clear proofs and be inferred by the same method of reasoning for instance the members of a club i belong to define man as sociable animal and so we dont count as men the human creatures of whom it can be said that we prefer their absence to their presence by this standard its clear that men of pleasure goodhumoured men and men of wit are the only human creatures who properly and truly count as men therefore whatever is conducive to good incomes for them is for the good of mankind and consequently very just and lawful even though it seems to bring loss or harm to other creatures i say seems because no real harm can be done in respect of life or property to those who dont know how to enjoy life and property we hold this on the basis of clear and well connected reasoning but others may view things in another light give different definitions draw different conclusions and perhaps regard as a wart or tumour of human nature what we think to be the top and flower of the creation from all which there must arise a very different system of morals politics rights and notions lysicles then swing into a jokey classification of men that someone invented in which kinds of men at given the names of kinds of animals thus according to this system the fishes are the men who swim in pleasure the beasts are dry drudging covetous rapacious folk and all those addicted to trouble and business like oxen and other dry land animals which spend their lives in labour and fatigue the birds are airy notional men enthusiasts projectors poets philosophers and such like if you ask me which species of mankind i like best i answer the flying fish ie a man of animal enjoyment with a mixture of whim thus you see we have our creeds and our systems just as more solemn folk do with this difference that our systems are not straitlaced not strapped on tightly but sit easy to be slipped off or on as the mood takes us or the occasion serves and now i can listen with the greatest equanimity imaginable to my opinions being argued against or refuted i wish all men were like that but youll find a sort of meni neednt name the sortthat cant endure having their opinions examined or their faults criticized they are against reason because reason is against them we freethinkers are all for liberty of conscience if our tenets are absurd we allow them to be freely argued against and inspected and by parity of reasoning we might hope to be allowed the same privilege regarding the opinions of other men o alciphron wares that cant stand the light are indeed suspect so whatever moves you to make this complaint i promise you that i never will up to now i have allowed your reason its full scope and ill always do so in the future but for the love of truth be candid and dont spend your strength and our time on matters that arent significant or are irrelevant to our topic or have been agreed between us we allow that tyranny and slavery are bad things but why should we fear them from the clergy at this time we agree that rites and ceremonies arent of central importance in religion but why should we ridicule things that in their own nature are not bad and may be good and that bear the stamp of supreme authority i freely admit that men in theology as well as other subjects get tangled in useless disputes and will probably go on doing so till the end of the world but why must all the human weakness and mistakes of clergymen be attributed to wicked designs why indiscriminately abuse their character and their beliefs is this like candour love of truth and freethinking granted bad temper and illbreeding can occasionally be found in the clergy but arent the same faults found in english laymen who have spent their lives in a secluded rural environment i grant that theres endless futility in the works of the scholastics but i deny that a volume of that does as much harm as a page of minute philosophy that weak or wicked men should by favour of the world creep into power and high positions in the churchtheres nothing surprising in that and it is natural to suppose that once they are in those positions they will behave like themselves but through all this it is obvious that what drives them in their unworthy achievements is not the gospel but the world not the spirit but the flesh not god but the devil we dont shrink from agreeing that nothing is more infamous than vice and ignorance in a clergyman nothing lower than a hypocrite more trivial than a pedant more cruel than an inquisitor but you should agree in your turn gentlemen that nothing is more ridiculous and absurd than for pedantic ignorant and corrupt men to throw the first stone at every shadow of their own defects and vices in other men when i think about the detestable state of slavery and superstition i feel my heart swelling to take in the utter blessing of independent liberty this is the sacred and high privilege the very life and health of our english constitution so you mustnt be surprised if we with a vigilant and searching eye guard it against the minutest appearance of evil you must even allow us to cut around it going deep and using a magnifying glass so as better to see and extirpate every least speck that appears in the freedom that we are careful to preserve and angry to see threatened as for unrestricted liberty i leave that to savages who i think are the only ones who have it but as for the reasonable legal liberty of our constitution i most heartily and sincerely wish it may to survive and flourish among us for ever he says that any amount of vigilance is justified if it stops attempts to change our free and gentle government into a slavish or severe one but how he demands can one get out of this any basis for an attack on religion there follows an discussion of rights of suppression alciphron reports a magistrate who was so hardpressed by freethinkers that he couldnt find anything to say in defence of his religion except that if ten million people inhabiting the same island wanted to have laws establishing religion in certain ways and ten thousand able men publicly sneered at those laws the ten million would be entitled to expel the ten thousand out of the island and what answer would you make to this remark of the magistrate the answer is obvious by the law of nature which is superior to any human institutions intelligence and knowledge have a right to command folly and ignorance i say that able men have by natural right a dominion over fools this doctrine however was never thoroughly understood until quite recently after conversation about a hardpressed individual magistrate alciphron will now revert to using the magistrate in the manner described in a note on page as a kind of shorthand for the lawmaking and lawenforcing authorities of the country a generation back hobbes and his followersthough otherwise very great mendeclared in favour of the religion of the magistrate probably because they were afraid of the magistrate but times have changed and the magistrate may now be afraid of us crito briefly comments on this and then launches into an anecdote that starts a brief and inconclusive discussion of the legal requirement that only professed christians could serve on juries then this much is certain the christian reformed religion is a principal part and cornerstone of our free constitution and i really think it is the only thing that makes us deserve freedom and makes us able to enjoy it freedom is either a blessing or a curse depending on how men use it if our religion were wiped out among us and the ideas that are regarded by freethinkers as prejudices of a christian education were erased from the minds of britons it seems to me that the best thing that could then happen would be the loss of our freedom a people who have such restless ambition such strength of feeling such enmity between factions so much at stake in contests such unrestricted licence of speech and press amid so much wealth and luxurythe only thing that has so far kept them from ruin are the hoary old wives tales he uses a latin phrase quoting persius as on page that you claim to be wiping out under the christian religion this nation has been greatly improved from being a sort of savages we have become civilized polished and learned we have made a decent and noble figure both at home and abroad and as our religion decreases i am afraid we shall be found to have declined so why should we persist in that dangerous experiment one would think crito that you had forgotten the many calamities caused by churchmen and religion and one would think that you had forgotten what we said this very day in answer to that objection i dont want to go on for ever saying the same things so ill make just three points if we reflect on the past state of the christian world and especially of our country with our feuds and factions that existed while we all had the same religioneg the war of the roses so violent and bloody and longwe may well suspect that the nastiness that has more recently shown up under the mask of religion would have broken out under some other pretext if religion hadnt been available it doesnt follow from anything you can say about our history that the evils accidentally arising from religion bear any proportion to the good effects it has really produced or to the evils it has prevented the best things can accidentally give rise to evil and such an accidental effect is not strictly speaking produced by the good thing itself but by some evil thingnot a part property or effect of itthat happens to coincide with it i think we have given enough discussion to the topic of todays session i must acknowledge that theres something in what crito has said about the usefulness of the christian religion lysicles may not like this but i owe it to my status as a fair impartial adversary to say this ill even admit that some of our sect are in favour of tolerating christianity i remember a meeting of a number of able men where after much debate we passed three resolutions the first was that no religion ought to be tolerated in the state but this on more mature thought was judged impracticable the second was that all religions should be tolerated but none looked on with favour except atheism but it was feared that this might make trouble among the lower sort of people the third resolution was that some religion or other should be established for the use of the vulgar after a long dispute about which religion this should be it was proposed that the present religion might be tolerated until a better one was found but while i grant that christianity is expedient i can never think it true while there are unanswerable objections to it is it all right if i present those at our next meeting to which we all agreed sixth dialogue monday in the original work this is by a considerable margin the longest of the dialogues but not in this version from which much of the philosophically uninteresting material has been cut dion reports that on the sunday the various people spent the day in their characteristic ways then the next morning we assembled at the same place as on saturday and when we were all seated i remarked that during the preceding week our discussion had been longer and less interrupted than i had ever known in town where mens hours are broken by visits business and amusementsso much so that anyone who settles for forming his ideas wholly from conversation must end up with ideas that are very shattered and incomplete and what have we achieved replied alciphron through all these continued discussions for my part i think that with regard to the main point that divides us the truth of the christian religion im just where i was at the outset i answered that so many points had been examined discussed and agreed between him and his adversaries that i hoped to see them eventually agreeing on everything for in the first place i said the principles and opinions of those who are called freethinkers or minute philosophers have been pretty clearly explained it has been also agreed that vice isnt beneficial to the nation in the way that some men imagine it is that virtue is highly useful to mankind but that the beauty of virtue is not enough on its own to get men to be virtuous that therefore the belief in a god and providence ought to be encouraged in the state and tolerated in good company as a useful notion and it has been proved that there is a god that it is reasonable to worship him and that the worship faith and principles prescribed by the christian religion are a good influence alciphrons reply was addressed to even if everything that dion has just said is true he said that doesnt move me an inch from where i was at the outset regarding the main point thats because nothing in all this proves the truth of the christian religion though each of the details dion has listed might create a prejudice in its favour so i must be on my guard against being a prejudiced personprejudiced in favour of christianity as a lover of truth i must look sharp and consider carefully every step i take you may remember alciphron that you suggested as todays topic certain difficulties and objections that you had to offer against the christian religion we are now ready to hear and consider anything of that kind that you think fit to produce atheism and the wrong idea of christianity as something harmful to mankind are great prejudices and a mans losing them may make him more apt to argue with candour and submit to reasonable proof but losing prejudices against an opinion as you have done isnt the same as acquiring a prejudice in its favour as you fear you may have done so we have reason to hope that youll be able to do justice to your cause without being uncritically in love with it after a selfcongratulatory opening alciphron says that he will do his best to share with those who are wandering lower down in the narrow dark paths of error the view of things that he has achieved from his lofty stand above the reach of prejudice then know then that each of the various groups of men has a faith and a religious system that sprouts from the common grain of enthusiasm that they all havea grain that is a basic ingredient in the mix of human nature each group tells of communication with the invisible world revelations from heaven divine oracles and the like when i consider all these claims with an impartial eye i cant possibly assent to them all and i find within myself something that restrains me from assenting to any of them im willing to go where i am led by common sense and the light of nature but the same reason that tells me to yield to rational proof forbids me to accept opinions without proof this holds in general against all revelationsall let this be counted as my first objection against the christian religion in particular this objection presupposes that theres no proof or reason for believing the christian revelation so if good reason can be assigned for such a belief the objection comes to nothing now i presume youll agree that a true and proper reason for believing a report is the authority of the person who makes it and the better his authority the sounder the claim his report has to our assent well now the authority of god is on all accounts the best so it is most reasonable to believe anything that comes from god meaning anything that is told to us by god i agree but then you have to prove that it does come from god and arent miracles and the fulfilment of prophecies joined with the excellence of its doctrine a sufficient proof that the christian religion came from god miracles would indeed prove something but what proof have we of these miracles proof of the same kind that we do havethe only kind we can haveof events that occurred long ago and far away we have authentic accounts passed down to us from eyewitnesses whom we cant conceive to have been tempted to deceive us by any human motive whatsoever why cant we because in giving these accounts they were acting contrary to their interests their prejudices and the very principles in which they had been nursed and brought up these accounts were confirmed by the unparalleled razing of the city of jerusalem and the scattering of the jewish nation which is an enduring testimony to the truth of the gospel particularly of the predictions of our blessed saviour for example and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh luke within less than a century these accounts were spread throughout the world and believed by great numbers of people they were also written down translated into numerous languages and handed down with the same respect and consent of christians in the most distant churches dont you see said alciphron staring straight at crito that all this depends on tradition and tradition believe me gives only a weak hold it is a chain whose first links may be stronger than steel and yet the last ones weak as wax and brittle as glass imagine a picture copied successively by a hundred painters each copying from the one before how like the original will the last copy be how lively and clear will an image be after a hundred reflections between two parallel mirrors thats how like and lively i think a faint vanishing tradition will be at the end of sixteen or seventeen centuries some men have a false heart others a wrong head and even when heart and head are both good memory may be treacherous something gets added something omitted something varied from the truth and the cumulative result of many such additions deductions and alterations through the centuriesthe bottom lineis quite different from what the tradition started with we can know ancient facts by oral tradition or written tradition and a written tradition may be either private kept in the hands of particular men or public recorded in public archives now as far as i can see all these three sorts of tradition agree in attesting to the genuine antiquity of the gospels and they are strengthened by supplementary evidence from rites instituted festivals observed and buildingschurches baptistries and sepulchresput up by ancient christians granting that your objection holds against oral tradition on its own i cant think it is so difficult to transcribe faithfully and once something has been put in writing it is secure against slips of memory and can with reasonable care be preserved intact for as long as the manuscript lastswhich we know from experience can be more than a thousand years a tradition of more than sixteen hundred years needs only two or three links in its chain he gives an example and despite the great length of time those links may be very sound and unbroken and no reasonable man will deny that an ancient manuscript may be as credible now as when it was first written we have it on good authorityand anyway it seems probablethat the first christians were careful to transcribe copies of the gospels and epistles for their private use and that other copies were preserved as public records in many churches throughout the world and that portions of them were constantly read in their assemblies what more could be said to prove the authenticity of the writings of classic authors or ancient records of any kind alciphron turned to euphranor and said silencing an adversary is different from convincing himdont you agree euphranor oh yes they are different but what i want is to be convinced its not so clear to me that you do look however willing a man is to be convinced he cant be convinced by probable arguments when there is a demonstration going the other way i agree that he cant well it is as obvious as demonstration can make it that no divine faith can possibly be built on tradition take the case of an honest credulous farmer who is drilled and lectured every sunday by his parish priest clearly its the parson he believes in not god all he knows about revelations doctrines and miracles is what the priest tells him he believes all this and his faith is purely human if you say he has the liturgy and the bible as foundation for his faith the difficulty still recurs as regards the liturgy he pins his faith on the civil magistrate as well as the ecclesiastic one and neither of those can claim divine inspiration as for the bible he takes both that and his prayerbook on trust from the printer who he believes made true editions from true copies so faith is at work here but faith in what faith in the priest in the magistrate in the printer editor transcriber none of whom can possibly be claimed to be divine i had the hint for this argument from cratylus its an arrow out of his quivera sharp one let me get hold of this arrow and try it out for myself suppose that your farmer hears a magistrate declare the law from the bench or suppose he reads it in a statute book do you think that the magistrate or the printer is the true and proper object of his faith and submission or do you acknowledge a higher authority on which their official actions are based again if you read a passage in the roman historian tacitus that you believe to be true would you say you assented to it on the authority of the printer or transcriber rather than the historian maybe maybe not i dont think im obliged to answer these questions all you are doing is to transfer the question from one subject to another what we were discussing was not law or nonreligious history but religious tradition and divine faith i can see well enough which way you are heading but ill never accept that you can solve one difficulty by starting up another o alciphron you expect others to stay fair and stand firm as you chose to express it on page while you pluck out their prejudices but you elude our grasp at every turn how can euphranor argue with you if not from your concessions and how can he know what they are unless you tell him my question admits of only two answers take your pick from one of the answers it will follow that by a parity of reason we can easily conceive how a man can have divine faith without ever feeling inspiration or seeing a miracle that is because it is equally possible for a mind to which divine revelation has come by some channeloral or scripturalto carry its thought and submission back up that channel to the source ending up with faith not in human but in divine authority its proper and true object being not the mechanisms and agents of the channel but rather the great origin itself from the other answer it will follow that youre introducing a general scepticism into human knowledge and smashing the hinges on which civil government and all the affairs of the world turn in short youll destroy human faith in order to get rid of divine i leave it to you to consider how well this goes with your announcement that you want to be convinced i really would be glad to be convinced one way or otherto come to some conclusion but i have so many objections in store that you shouldnt attach much weight to your dealing with one of them depend on it youll find me behaving like a gentleman and a lover of truth ill state my objections briefly and plainly and accept reasonable answers as fast as you can give them come on euphranor make the best case you can for your tradition you can never present as a constant and universal tradition one that is admitted to have been unknown or at best disputed in the church for several centuries and this is the case with the new testament for though we now have a settled canonmeaning that the church hierarchy eventually decided which books should be included in the new testament and which should noteveryone must see and admit that a tradition cant grow stronger by age and that anything that was uncertain in the earliest christian times cant be undoubted later on what do you say to this euphranor id like to get clearer about your meaning before i give an answer this objection of yours seems to presuppose that a tradition that has been constant and undisputed may be admitted as a proof but that where the tradition is defective the proof must be so too is this your meaning it is so the gospels and the epistles of st paul which were universally accepted from the start and have never since been doubted of by the church must be accepted as genuine and since these books contain all those points that are in controversy between you and me i dont need to argue with you about the authority of other books of the new testament that didnt come to be generally known and accepted in the church until later someone who assents to the undisputed books is no longer an unbeliever even if he doesnt regard the book of revelation or the epistles of st james or st jude or st peter or the last two epistles of st john as deserving to be in the canon the additional authority of these portions of the bible may carry weight in particular controversies between christians but it cant add anything to arguments against an unbeliever as such when you are a christian it will be time enough to argue about the status of those books and youll be nearer to being christian if your way there is shortened by the omission of that question for the present not as near as you may think despite all the fair and plausible things you may say about tradition when i consider the spirit of forgery that reigned in primitive times and reflect on the many gospels acts and epistles that were attributed to the apostles and then came to be recognized as spurious i confess that i cant help suspecting the whole bible tell me alciphron do you suspect that all platos writings are spurious because the dialogue on death is agreed to be so wont you accept any of ciceros writings as genuine because sigonius passed off a book that he had written as ciceros de consolatione and the deception succeeded for some time suppose i admit as genuine the works of cicero and plato that are commonly accepted as genuine what then why then i would want to know whether its balanced and impartial in a freethinker to measure the credibility nonreligious and sacred books by different standards let us know what we christians are allowed to work with when we argue with minute philosophers are we allowed the benefit of common maxims in logic and criticism if so then please give a reason why writings which in the style and manner and matter bear visible signs of being fraudulent and have accordingly been rejected by the church can be used as an argument against writings that have been universally accepted and handed down by a unanimous constant tradition i dont know of anything truly valuable that hasnt been counterfeited so your argument has a universal scope but something that tells against everything doesnt hold against anything it would seem as silly to reject the genuine writings of nonreligious authors because of the fakes as it would be unreasonable to suppose that the heretics and the many sects of christians wouldnt have included anyone capable of that kind of deceit i see no way of judging this at such a great distance of time it is all dark and doubtfulmere guesswork crito intervenes with a list of the reasons there are to trust the judgments of the church councils about what is spurious and what genuine alciphron then moves to a new point the bible is not well enough written to have been divinely inspired euphranor says that thats not decisive even an earthly monarch leaves the detailed wording of his laws and proclamations to his secretaries and clerks to express his sense in their own words also some roughness of style matches the roughness we find in largescale naturefor example there is never a really straight shorelinethough we do find geometrically exact shapes in the works of insects so it seems that a scrupulous attention to what men call the rules of art is not observed in the big productions of the author of nature alciphron replies that thats all right as regards niceties of grammar and expression but he still counts it against the divine inspiration idea that so much of the bible is written in a flat characterless boring way euphranor explodes o alciphron if i dared to follow my own judgment i would be apt to think there are noble beauties in the style of the bible in the narrative parts a simple and unaffected manner in the devotional and prophetic parts an animated and sublime style and in the doctrinal parts such an air of dignity and authority as seems to declare that their origin is divine but i shant set up my judgment on such a delicate matter against that of the wits and men of genius who are so plentiful in your sect nor am i tempted to do so because it seems to me that this latest argument of yours is worthless anyway something isnt shown not be the oracle of god by being delivered in a plain dress rather than in the enticing words of mans wisdom this may perhaps work as a defence of some simplicity and carelessness in writing but what defence can there be for nonsense crude nonsense i could easily give many examples because i once read the bible the whole way through looking for them look at the th psalm in this bible that i have here the author begins very grandly calling on all the inhabitants of the earth to listen and assuring them that his mouth will speak of wisdom and the meditation of his heart will be of understanding but he has no sooner finished this preface than he puts this senseless question wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the wickedness of my heels shall compass me about the wickedness of my heels what nonsense after such a solemn introduction i have naturally weak eyes and many things that i cant see are clearly seen by others so i dont conclude that a thing is absolutely invisible because i cant see it well it may be with my understanding the way it is with my eyes so i dont venture to declare a thing to be nonsense because i dont understand it he then goes through several interpretations that have been suggested for the passagetreating it as some kind of metaphor or as involving a hebrew idiom that we dont have in english crito chimes in with boring anecdotes about foreigners who have been misled by english idioms then euphranor resumes in this very psalm that you have picked on i should have thought that the good sense and morality contained in what follows the obscure bit would make a fairminded reader judge favorably concerning the original sense of the author in the part that he couldnt understand tell me alciphron when you are reading the classics and encounter something that you cant make sense of do you immediately conclude that it is nonsense by no means we have to expect difficulties to arise from different idioms old customs hints and allusions that may be clear at one time or place and obscure at another then why wont you judge passages of the bible by the same rule the sources of obscurity that you mention are all common both to religious and nonreligious writings and theres no doubt that in both sorts of writing the difficulties would vanish if we had a more detailed knowledge of the languages and circumstances he gives an examplea phrase in the book of jeremiah that looks odd unless one knows certain things about life near the river jordan here and there a difficult passage may be cleared up but there are many that cant be explained away by any exercise of human skill or ingenuity what do you say you about the discoveries that some of our learned writers have made of false citations from the old testament found in the new testament some new testament citations of passages in the old testament arent exactly accurate this has been known for centuries by christian writersit isnt a new discovery by minute philosophers it can be explained by errors of transcription and is of no great importance he develops this reply at some length concluding what can you infer from all this except that the design of the bible was not to give us exact knowledge of every detail and that the holy spirit didnt dictate every particle and syllable and miraculously preserve them from even the slightest alteration alciphron renews his attack on the bibles style and euphranor renews his defence then it wouldnt be a problem for me to admit that a popular incorrect style might serve the general ends of revelation as well as a more precise and exact one but i cant get over the obscurity if the supreme being had spoken to man it seems to me he would have spoken clearly and the word of god wouldnt need commentaries see qa note on page i you seem to think that obscurity is a defect but if it turns out not to be one that will be the end of this objection of yours ii now speech and style are instrumental in the conveying of thoughts and notions in getting knowledge opinion and assent iii and the perfection of an instrument should be measured by the use for which it is intended iv so something that is a defect in one instrument may be no defect in another for instance edged tools are in general designed to cut but because the uses of an axe and a razor are different its not a defect in an axe that it isnt as sharp as a razor or in the razor that it isnt as strong and heavy as an axe v so we can say in general that any instrument is perfect if it suits the purpose or intention of the person who uses it vi from which it seems to follow that no mans speech is defective in clearness if it isnt intelligible to all men but is intelligible enough to the ones the speaker intended should understand it or if it isnt equally clear in all parts or doesnt convey perfect knowledge all through but does convey an imperfect hint which is all the speaker intended vii so we need to know the intention of the speaker if we are to know whether his style is obscure through defect or design viii but no one man can possibly know all the ends and purposes of gods revelations so for all you know to the contrary the obscurity of some parts of the bible may fit quite well with a purpose that you dont know in which case they arent evidence that the bible doesnt come from god the books of the bible were written in ancient languages at distant times on various occasions and on very different subjects doesnt that make it reasonable to think that some parts or passages might have been clearly enough understood by those for whose use they were principally designed and yet seem obscure to us who speak another language and live at another time is it at all absurd or unsuitable to our ideas of god and man to suppose that god may reveal but be reserved about how much he reveals on certain remote and sublime subjects content to give us hints and glimpses rather than clear views may we not also suppose as something reasonable and suggested by the analogy of nature that some points that could have been more clearly explained were left obscure merely to encourage our diligence and modestytwo virtues which if it wouldnt seem disrespectful to such great men i would recommend to the minute philosophers lysicles replied this indeed is excellent you expect that men of sense and spirit should in great humility put out their eyes and blindly swallow all the absurdities and nonsense that are offered to them as divine revelation on the contrary i want them to open their eyes look sharply and try the spirit berkeleys phrase to see whether it is of god rather than passively and ignorantly condemning all religions together if they would compare the christian system with other claimants to divine revelation consider impartially the doctrines precepts and events contained in christianity weigh them in the balance against any other religious natural moral or historical accounts and examine diligently all the proofs internal and external that for so many ages have been able to influence and persuade so many wise learned and inquiring men they might find in christianity certain special features that sufficiently distinguish it from all other religions and supposed revelations as a basis for a reasonable faith if that happened i leave it to the minute philosophers to consider whether they are right to take a revelation so distinguished and attested and dismiss it with impatient scorn because some parts of it are obscure he returns to the topic of obscurity in texts written in an ancient foreign language the likelihood that we wont know all the idioms and so on and repeats his plea for judging religious writings in the same manner as nonreligious ones you may lecture and expound but nothing you have said or can say alters the fact that a revelation that doesnt reveal is a mere contradiction in terms tell me alciphron dont you accept that the light of the sun is the most glorious production of providence in this natural world suppose i do well this light that you cant deny was made by god shines only on the surface of things doesnt shine in the night shines imperfectly in the twilight is often interrupted refracted and obscured represents distant things and small things dubiously imperfectly or not at all isnt all this true it is doesnt it follow that to expect in this world a constant uniform light from god without any mixture of shade or mystery would be to depart from the rule and analogy of the creation and that therefore its wrong to argue that the light of revelation is not divine because its not as so clear and full as you expect or because it doesnt shine equally at all times and in all places because i claim to be fair and unbiased in this debate i have to admit that you say some plausible thingsas a man of argument will always be able to do in vindication of his prejudices but i should come into the open and tell you once for all that however much you question and answer illustrate and enlarge you wont convince me that the christian religion is divinely revealed in support of this attitude i have said several things and have many more to say that carry weight not only with myself but with many great men who are good friends of mine and they wont stop carrying weight no matter what euphranor says on the other side i envy you the happiness of knowing such people i cant have that advantage living as i do in this outoftheway place so i have to make the most of this opportunity that you and lysicles have put into my hands i regard you as two able physicians and you were pleased to consider me as a patient whom you have generously undertaken to cure now a patient must be completely free to explain his case and report all his symptoms because concealing a symptom might prevent a perfect cure so please understand me not as objecting to or arguing against either your skill or your medicines but only as reporting on my condition and on the effects your medicines have on me alciphron didnt you give me to understand that you would wipe out my prejudices it is true a good physician eradicates every fibre of the disease come you shall have a patient hearing tell me didnt plato believe that god inspired particular men as organs or trumpets to proclaim and sound forth his oracles to the world and wasnt the same opinion also embraced by other great writers of antiquity socrates seems to have thought that all true poets spoke by inspiration and cicero held that there was no extraordinary genius without it what would you infer from this i would infer that inspiration shouldnt seem impossible or absurd but rather agreeable to the light of reason and the notions of mankind youll agree with this i suppose because you have made it an objection against one particular revelation that there are so many claims to revelation throughout the world alciphron replies with a dig at the word inspire it comes he rightly says from latin meaning to breathe or blow in so it should be applied to mere wind or vapour and not to big truths euphranor sharply takes this up pointing out that alciphron is willing to say that he discourses while sitting down and yet discourse comes from latin meaning run about alciphron defends his use of discourse in the obvious way and euphranor cashes in on that may we not as well conceive that the term inspiration might be borrowed from sensible things to stand for gods action when in an extraordinary manner he influences arouses and enlightens the mind of a prophet or an apostle lets drop the silly point about blowing in and get back to our real topic when we look into our own minds it seems to me we plainly perceive certain instincts impulses and tendencies that from time to time spring up unaccountably in our souls this is ordinary and natural but why cant we conceive it possible for the human mind for an extraordinary reason to be moved in an extraordinary manner having its faculties stirred up and kicked into action by a supernatural power he admits that there have been and will be wild visions and morbid ravings but that doesnt mean that there arent also genuine inspirations we cant rule out the possibility that a true prophet or inspired person can distinguish divine inspiration from mentally unbalanced imagination as easily as we can distinguish sleeping from waking he quotes the book of jeremiah to that effect i see no need to deny that inspirations and revelations are possible make the best you can of this concession well if something is allowed as possible we are entitled to suppose that it is fact we are let us then suppose that god chose to make a revelation to men and that he inspired some men as a means to instruct others having supposed this can you deny that their inspired discourses and revelations might have been committed to writing or that the written versions might in the course of time become obscure in many places that some of them might even have been less clear than others at the outset or that they might get altered by frequent transcribing as other writings are known to have done isnt it even very probable that all these things would happen i grant it well then how can you defend your claim that the bible is not divine because of facts about it that you now acknowledge would probably accompany any divine revelation transmitted down to us through so many centuries he concedes the point about small blemishes that might arise from copying errors etc but i defy the wit of man to invent anything more extravagant than the accounts the bible gives of apparitions devils miracles god manifest in the flesh being born again grace selfdenial resurrection of the dead and suchlike sick dreamsthings so odd unaccountable and remote from human understanding that you have no more chance of clearing them of the charge of absurdity than you have of making a black man white by washing him no critical skill can justify them no tradition can recommend themeven as inventions of competent men let alone as divine revelations i always had a great opinion of your wisdom alciphron but now i consider you as something more than man how otherwise could you know what it may be proper for god to reveal this is of course a sneer i dont think it is insulting to the greatest of human understandings to suppose that they are ignorant of many things that arent suited to their faculties or lie out of their reach even the plans of princes often lie beyond the ken of their subjects who can only know what is revealed to them by those at the helm and are often unqualified to judge concerning the usefulness and likely consequences even of what they are allowed to know until in due course the scheme unfolds and is explained by the course of events of course many things contained in the bible are remote from the common understanding of mankind but i dont see that it follows from this that they didnt come from divine revelation on the contrary doesnt it seem reasonable to suppose that a revelation from god would contain something different in kind or more excellent in degree than anything that lies within the grasp of humans even of the wisest philosopher accounts of separate spirits good or bad prophecies miracles etc are undoubtedly strange but i dont see how you can prove them to be impossible or absurd some things are so evidently absurd that it would be almost as silly to disprove them as to believe them and i take thesethe ones i listed a moment agoto be of that sort isnt it possible that some men show as much prejudice and narrowness in rejecting all such accounts as others might show slackness and credulity in accepting them i cant understand why anyone who admits the union of the soul with the body should declare it impossible for the human nature to be united to the divine in some way that cant be described or grasped by reason nor can i see any absurdity in the idea that sinful man may be born again may become a new creature by the grace of god reclaiming him from a carnal life to a spiritual life of virtue and holiness and since being governed by sense and appetite is contrary to the happiness and perfection of a rational creature i dont in the least wonder that we are told to exercise selfdenial as for the resurrection of the dead i dont regard that as so very contrary to the analogy of nature when i see plants that have been left to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigour or a worm that appears to be dead change its nature so that something that at first crawled on the earth becomes a new species and flies around with wings and when i consider that the soul and body are things of such utterly different kinds i cant see any reason to be positive that the soul must necessarily be extinguished when the body falls to pieces especially since i find in myself a strong natural desire for immortality and i havent observed that natural appetites are given in vain given merely to be frustrated you regard certain things as extravagant and absurd but i shant agree with that until i see good reason for it no alciphron your positive airs mustnt be regarded as proofs and we wont think things are contrary to common sense just because you say so by common sense we ought to mean either the general sense of mankind or the improved reason of thinking men now i believe that all those articles you have so powerfully and vividly summed up and exploded can be shown to be consistent with and even in harmony with common sense in one or other of these senses that the gods might appear and converse among men and that the divinity might inhabit human nature were things that the heathens believed and though the notion of a devil may not be so obvious or so fully described there are plain traces of it in several traditions he cites ancient greeks chaldeans and egyptians and reports that a text as early as homer contains something that cardinal bessarion has identified as an allusion to the fall of satan then many more classical references in connection with the other articles on alciphrons list apparently with grace uppermost though it isnt mentioned by name winding up any man who really thinks has only to look at what other thinking men have thoughtmen who cant be supposed to be prejudiced in favour of revealed religionand hell see cause if not to think with reverence of the christian doctrines of grace selfdenial rebirth sanctification and the rest at least to judge more modestly and cautiously than someone who confidently declares them absurd and in conflict with the reason of mankind lysicles says that none of this has the slightest appeal him and that if this makes anyone think he is ignorant i am happy and safe in my ignorance crito says perhaps not so safe which he and backs up thus mere ignorance isnt a crime but willful ignorance deliberate ignorance ignorance from laziness or conceited ignorance is a faultwe have the testimony of heathen writers as proof of that and it doesnt need proof to show that if ignorance is a fault then we cant be secure in ignorance as an excuse honest crito seems to hint that man should take care to inform himself while alive so that his neglect to do so wont be punished when he is dead the best way to get a gentleman to keep on with something is to try to frighten him out of it this is the stale and absurd tactic that priests use making them and their religion more odious and contemptible to me than all the other items put together that hellandeternalpunishment thing is the most absurd as well as the nastiest thought that ever entered into the head of mortal man but you must admit that it isnt an exclusively christian absurdity because socrates that great freethinker of athens thought it probable that impious men are punished for ever in hell it is reported of this same socrates that he was often known to think for twentyfour hours at a stretch fixed in the same position and wrapped up in meditation our modern freethinkers are men of a more lively sort those old philosophers were most of them insecure i think they had a narrow timid way of thinking that falls far short of the frank spirit of our times but if a man doesnt know the nature of the soul how can reason give him any assurance about whether it is mortal or immortal but what if i do know the nature of the soul i have been taught that whole secret by a modern freethinker a man of science who discovered the nature of the soul not by a tiresome looking into himself or by getting himself confused in a labyrinth of notions or by stupidly thinking for whole days and nights together but by looking into things and observing the analogy of nature this great man is a tried and tested scientist who has conducted many experiments on plants he holds that men and plants are really of the same species that animals are moving plants and plants are fixed animals that the mouths of animals have the same use as the roots of plants that blossoms and flowers correspond to the private parts of the human body that plant and animal bodies are both organic and both have life which is a certain motion and circulation of juices through the appropriate tubes or vessels the soul he says is the specific form or source from which come the distinct qualities or properties of things we start with plants because they are simpler than animals and thus easier to analyse the soul of any plantrosemary for exampleis nothing more or less than its essential oil this is the source of its special fragrance taste and medicinal virtuesie its life and operations use chemical techniques to separate or extract this essential oil and you get the soul of the plant whats left behind being a dead carcass that doesnt have a single property or power of the plant this essential oil is an oily substance with a fine subtle element or volatile salt imprisoned in it strictly speaking this volatile salt is the essence of the plants soul containing all its powers and the oil is the vehicle of this most subtle part of the soul the part that fixes and individuates it and just as the plant dies when separated from this oil so the soul dies when this essential oil is split up into its elements as you can see by leaving it exposed for some time to the open air so that the volatile salt or spirit can fly off after which the oil remains dead and tasteless not perceptibly weighing any less but having lost that volatile essence of the soul that ethereal aura that spark of existence which returns and mixes with the solar light the universal soul of the world and the only source of life im talking about all lifeof plants lower animals and thinking animals which differ only according to the fineness of organization of their bodies this chemical system lets you at once into the nature of the soul and accounts for all its phenomena in the compound that is called man the soul or essential oil is what commonly goes by the name of animal spirit see note on page for chemists do now agree that animal spirits are nothing but the more subtle oils now in proportion as the essential oil of the plant we call man is more subtle than that of other plants the volatile salt that impregnates it is more free to act and that explains the properties and actions of humans that distinguish them from lower creatures he gives some examples o lysicles your ingenious friend has opened up a new scene and explained the most obscure and difficult points in the clearest and easiest manner this account of things struck my fancy i must admit im no great lover of creeds or systems but when a notion is reasonable and based on experience i know how to value it really seriously lysicles do you believe this account to be true in the next exchange the artist and his art mean roughly the expert and the field in which he is an expert really seriously i dont know whether i do or not but i can assure you that the ingenious artist himself hasnt the least doubt about it and believe an artist in his art is a sound bit of advice and a short way to knowledge but what does the soul of man have to do with the chemical art the same reason that tells me to trust a skillful artist in his art inclines me to suspect him when he is out of his art men are too apt to reduce unknown things to the standard of what they know and bring a prejudice or slant from things they have been familiar with in making judgments about things with which they have not been familiar i have known a violinist solemnly teach that the soul is harmony a geometrician very positive that the soul must be extended and a physician who having pickled half a dozen embryos and dissected a few rats and frogs became very sure of himself and affirmed that there is no soul at all lysicles declines to argue saying in effect theres the theory take it or leave it which euphranor ironically describes as said like a gentleman then he asks whether the maxim about believing an artist in his art applies to clergymen lysicles says no why not because he lysicles knows as much about religious matters as the clergy do all men of good sense are competent judges of those matters what are gods attributes and his treatment of mankind the true end and happiness of rational creatures and the means of improving and perfecting their beingsare these more easy and obvious matters than the ones to which ordinary secular studies are devoted perhaps not but i do know thissome things are so obviously absurd that no authority will make me give in to them for instance if all mankind tried to convince me that the son of god was born on earth in a poor family was spat upon beaten and crucified lived like a beggar and died like a thief i wouldnt believe a word of it common sense shows everyone how an earthly prince or ambassador can decently appear and the son of god coming as an ambassador from heaven must make an appearance that is much greater than that and is in all respects the very reverse of that which jesus christ is reportedeven by his own historiansto have made do you think lysicles that if a man entered london in a rich suit of clothes with a hundred gilt coaches and a thousand laced footmen this would be a more divine and truly grand appearance than if he had power with a word to heal all kinds of diseases to raise the dead to life and calm storms at sea oh im sure it is very agreeable to common sense to suppose that he could restore others to life but couldnt save his own you tell us of course that he rose again from the dead but what was the point of his dying in the first placethe just dying for the unjust the son of god dying for wicked men and why precisely there why exactly then why didnt he appear earlier and preach in all parts of the world so that the benefit was spread wider and more evenly account for all these points and reconcile them if you can to the common notions and plain sense of mankind crito replies with two points one is that some of lysicles questions are boorish and illmannered benevolent acts arent usually scrutinized as carefully as other acts who but a minute philosopher would on a gratuitous distribution of favours ask why now rather than earlier lysicles should face the fact that he is out of his depth none of us know nearly enough to be entitled to form judgments on what it would have been reasonable for god to do there are several pages of this you cant judge the parts of a machine without knowing how the whole thing works lysicles says that some things can be seen at first glance to be so cruel and unjust that they are obviously unworthy of god to which crito replies that we should take into account à propos of how badly god treated the egyptians how badly the egyptians had treated the israelites and also repeated that caution in judgment is appropriate when we know that we dont have all the facts euphranor has a qa argument making the point that children often dont understandand may even resentactions by their parents that are entirely for their own good he likens this to lysicles attitude to actions by god the topic of the ancients versus the freethinking moderns comes up again in the course of it alciphron says that the present times gray and hoary with age and experience have a manifest advantage over those that are falsely called ancient the point being that in ancient times the world was younger than it is now he continues i tell you in plain english euphranor we dont want your revelations for this plain reason those that are clear were already known to everyone and noone gets any benefit from those that are obscure just as its impossible for anyone to believe the practical principles of the christian religion and not be the better for them so it is obvious that those principles may be much more easily taught as articles of faith than demonstrated or discovered as doctrines of science here highgrade theoretical knowledge we see all the time that many are instructed in matters of faith few are taught by scientific demonstration and fewer still can discover truth for themselves i wish that minute philosophers would reflect on some facts relating to the natural or civil concerns of the world with religion not coming into it namely how rarely men are swayed or governed by mere reasoning and how often by faith how little they know and how much they believe how uncommon it is to meet with a man who argues soundly who really is a master of reason or walks by that rule how much better qualified men are to judge concerning facts than concerning reasonings to receive truth on testimony than to deduce it from principles how general a spirit of trust or reliance runs through the whole system of life and opinion and at the same time how seldom the dry light of unprejudiced nature is followed or to be found if our thinking men would only give thought to these things they might find it hard to produce a good reason why faith which has so great a share in everything else should have no place in religion re dry light see note on page he then replies to the were already known to everyone part of what alciphron has just said by saying that obviously they werent perhaps they could have been known but revelation is useful if it reveals something that men havent taken the trouble to know even if they could have known it alciphron then moves to a complaint against prophecies namely that they are very obscure euphranor replies that some are obscure while some are not which is pretty much what should be expected given the way the world is and the way men are alciphron in reply refers to the scepticism about prophecies of freethinking experts on these matter and euphranor responds to that somewhat sneeringly and remarks that the christians have their experts too after a further exchange of insults euphranor offers some explanations of why certain prophecies are unclearto us at this time looking back in time we can see a certain progress from darker to lighter in religious matters so we can reasonably expect that future events will clear up such points as at present exercise the faith of believers alciphron now drops prophecies and turns to something else i want now to examine your religion by comparing the system of revelation with collateral accounts of ancient heathen writers and showing how much it clashes with them the christian revelation presupposes the jewish religion so if the jewish one is destroyed the christian one must of course fall to the ground with it i am going to go the short way by attacking this jewish revelation headon tell me if we believe the mosaic account of things ie the first five books of the old testament dont we have to hold that the world was created not quite six thousand years ago yes we do what will you say now if other ancient records carry the history of the world back many thousand years beyond this period what if the egyptians and chinese have accounts extending to thirty or forty thousand years what if the egyptians have observed twelve hundred eclipses during the space of fortyeight thousand years what if the chinese have also many observations antecedent to the jewish account of the creation what if the chaldeans had been observing the stars for more than four hundred thousand years and what shall we say if we have successions of kings and their reigns marked for several thousand years before the beginning of the world assigned by moses shall we reject the accounts and records of all other nationsthe most famous ancient and learned in the worldand preserve a blind reverence for moses the legislator of the jews if they deserve to be rejected euphranor replies why shouldnt we reject them this introduces an attack on the accounts and records that alciphron has mentioned the only reliable ones dont go as far back as moses time for the beginning of the world the writers of the records that stretch further back are unknown or unregarded by ancient astronomers modern scholars have uncovered inconsistencies in the chinese accounts alciphron remarks that the modern scholars in question are mostly roman catholic missionaries and euphranor replies that they are our only source of information about the chinese and that in any case it makes sense to trust them the same persons who tell us of these accounts refute them if we reject their authority in one case what right have we to build upon it in another alciphron praises the chinese generally as a learned able and acute people who are addicted to arts and sciences euphranor replies at length that on the contrary the chinese are superstitious credulous and absurd then he turns to the egyptian records purporting to make the world older than moses did and gets alciphron to admit that he doesnt know where those records were found when they were written how they were preserved and so on they arent mentioned by any ancient greek writers though some of them visited egypt euphranor comments again at even greater length on the credulity of any modern person like alciphron who believes such stuff alciphron replies with a challenge how can you account for the work that the great joseph scaliger and sir john marsham have put in on those records euphranor declines to account for it and deplores the fact that such substantial scholars as scaliger and marsham should waste time on that rubbishy stuff after all its hard to see why those egyptian priests should have set up spurious records supporting such great claims to antiquityrecords that differ one from another but are alike in one thing namely that they overthrow moses history how can this be accounted for if there was no real foundation for the records what pleasure profit or power could motivate men to forge successions of ancient names and periods of time for ages before the world began really alciphron is there anything so strange or unprecedented in this empty wish to extend the antiquity of nations beyond the truth hasnt it been seen in most parts of the world doesnt it appear even in our own times especially among dependent and subdued people who have little else to boast of he then launches into masses of detail first about the irish and then about the sicilians these being dependent and subdued people who invented long histories for themselves as a way of feeling important then why isnt it likely that the egyptians a subdued people invented fabulous accounts from the same motive and like others valued themselves because of extravagant claims to antiquity when in all other respects they were so much inferior to their masters and it is no less certain that the phœnicians assyrians and chaldeans were each a conquered and reduced people before the rest of the world appear to have heard anything of their claims to such remote antiquity but what need is there to work at accounting for the motivations of fabulous writers isnt it sufficient to see that they relate absurdities arent supported by any independent evidence seem not to have been believed even by their own countrymen and are inconsistent one with another theres nothing strange in the fact that men should have the stupidity to create false accounts so as to deceive the world what is strange is the fact that after so many learned critics have done so much towards undeceiving the world there should still be men who are capable of being taken in by the paltry scraps of fabulous or counterfeit writers let me point out that those learned critics may prove to be clergymen perhaps some of them roman catholics what about sir isaac newton was he either catholic or clergyman you may not grant that he was as wise and intellectually powerful as the great men of the minute philosophy but it you cant deny that he had read and thought a great deal on this subject ending his inquiry with a perfect contempt for all those celebrated rivals to moses it has been observed by able men that sir isaac newton though a layman was deeply prejudicedas we can from his great regard for the bible and the same holds for mr locke mr boyle lord bacon and other famous laymen who however knowledgeable on some matters cant be thought to have achieved the keen discernment that is the special distinction of your sect but perhaps there are reasons other than prejudice to incline a man to give moses the preference the government manners and religion of his country were based on the truth of his history there are clear traces of that history in the most ancient books and traditions of the gentiles particularly of the brahmins and parsees his account of the great flood is confirmed by signs in nature as well as by writings of antiquity his history is confirmed by the relatively recent invention of arts and sciences the gradual peopling of the world the very names of ancient nations and even by the authority and arguments of that renowned philosopher lucretius who is so much admired and followed by the freethinkers when he writes on other subjects the continual decrease of fluids the sinking of hills and the slowing of planetary motion provide natural evidence that this world had a beginning just as the civil or historical proofs that i have mentioned plainly indicate that this beginning occurred at about the time assigned to it in the bible and after all that let me add one more remark people digging into the earth have found quantities of shells and in some places bones and horns of animals complete and unbroken that have probably lain there for thousands of years that makes it seem probable that gems medals and metal or stone implements might have remained buried complete and unbroken for forty or fifty thousand years if the world had been that old so how does it come about that no such remains are found no remnants of all those centuries preceding the biblical account of time no fragments of buildings no public monuments no intaglios cameos statues reliefs medals inscriptions utensils or manufactured things of any kind are ever discovered to testify to the existence of those mighty empires those successions of monarchs heroes and demigods for so many thousand years let us look forward in time and think about a time twenty thousand years into the future with the intervening time having involved plagues famines wars and earthquakes all of which will have made great havoc in the world isnt it highly probable that pillars vases and statues that now exist would still exist at that future time and testify to our time and all the time between now and then im thinking of pillars etc made of granite porphyry or jasperstones that are so hard that we know them to have lasted for two thousand years above ground without any considerable alteration isnt it also probable that some of our current coins might be dug up at that time far in the future or that old walls and the foundations of buildings might show themselves just as the shells and stones of the primeval world are preserved down to our times these are matters that anyone can form a judgment about using common sense and ordinary experience they give us good reason to conclude that the world was created at about the time recorded in the bible alciphron sat musing and made no answer whereupon lysicles spoke up harking back to critos remark that lucretius supported the mosaic dating of the start of the world i must admit that i would rather suppose with lucretius that the world was made by chance and that men grew out of the earth like pumpkins than pin my faith on those wretched fablespinning fragments of oriental history that alciphron had used as evidence against moses dating of the start of that world as for the learned men who have taken pains to clarify them and piece them together they strike me as being no better than so many musty pedants an able freethinker may now and then make some use of their laborious output and play off one absurdity against anothereg an egyptian absurdity against a jewish one but dont infer from this that he has any real respect for the authority of such apocryphal writers or believes one syllable of the chinese babylonian or egyptian traditions if we seem to give them preference over the bible thats only because they are not established by law this is my plain sense of the matter and i dare say its the general sense of our sect they are too rational to take such trifles seriously though they sometimes give hints of deep learning and put on a grave face just to have fun at the expense of bigots since lysicles will have it so i am content not to build on accounts of time preceding the mosaic he then talks about historians of about moses own time they should be regarded as on a par with moses he says and some of them give accounts that utterly clash with hiseg one that says that the jews were really egyptians who had leprosy and were driven out of the country for that reason on this account the religion that they said had been given to them on mount sinai was really something which they as egyptians brought with them from egypt crito replies that those other accounts arent evidence against the mosaic one because they are in such conflict with one another and that linguistic considerations show that the jews werent egyptians and that a religion whose fundamental principle was monotheism and whose principal design was to abolish idolatry couldnt have come from egypt the most idolatrous of all nations after some more of this alciphron deplores the loss of the books of those great men celsus porphyry and julian books that would have enabled the modern freethinkers to demolish the whole jewish religious system at once crito questions that and says some slighting things about each of the three especially emphasizing how credulous they were accepting all sorts of weird beliefs they were he concludes whimsical superstitious weak and visionaryand he throws in a final gibe against the impartial gentlemen who admire the talents and are proud to tread in the footsteps of those three men see things in different lights something that one person wonders at is regarded as negligible by another it can even happen that a prejudiced mind whose attention is turned towards things faults and blemishes fancies it sees some shadow of defect in the great lights that have in our own days enlightened the world but tell me crito what you think of the jewish historian josephus he is agreed to have been a man of learning and judgment he did himself accept a revealed religion namely judaism and christians commonly cite him with respect when his authority suits their purposes all this i accept then mustnt it seem suspicious to any impartial inquirer that this learned jew should write the history of his own country focusing on the very place and time of jesus christs appearance without saying anything about the character miracles and doctrine of that extraordinary person some ancient christians were so sensitive about this that they tried to repair the situation by inserting a famous passage in the work of that historiana forgery that has been sufficiently detected by able modern critics well there is expert opinion on both sides of that question but i dont want to get into all that so i am content to take it your way by supposing that the passage is not genuine but is the pious fraud of some wrongheaded christian who couldnt tolerate the omission in josephus but that fraud cant make the omission a real objection against christianity and i cant see in the omission any other basis for amazement or suspicion supposing the gospel account to have exactly true it would seem very natural for josephus not to have reported it given that he was aiming by his work to give his country some standing in the eyes of the world which had been greatly prejudiced against the jews and knew little of their historya purpose that the life and death of our saviour wouldnt have contributed to even slightly josephus couldnt have been an eyewitness of our saviour or his miracles he was a highclass pharisee who was learned in foreign as well as jewish scholarship with a high position in the state whereas the gospel was preached to the poor the gospel was initially accepted and then spread by poor illiterate people chosen for this role so that the gospels spread wouldnt seem to be the work of man or a product of human selfinterest or power the jews generally expected the messiah to be a worldly and conquering princea prejudice that was so strong that they preferred attributing our saviours miracles to the devil to acknowledging him to be the messiah at josephuss time the jewish state was in a condition of hellish disorder and confusion with mens minds filled and stunned by unparalleled wars dissensions massacres and seditions of that devoted people taking all these facts together i dont find it strange that such a man who was writing with that view at that time and in those circumstances should omit to describe our blessed saviours life and death or to mention his miracles or to pay any attention to the state of the christian church which at that time was like a tiny seed just beginning to take root and germinate and this will seem even less strange if you bear in mind that the apostles in a few years after our saviours death left jerusalem set about convert nonjews and were dispersed throughout the world the converts in jerusalem were not only some of the poorest people but were also few in number the three thousand converts added to the church in one day when peter preached in jerusalem seem to have been strangers from all over the country who had gathered there to celebrate the feast of pentecost throughout the time of josephus and for several years more during a succession of fifteen bishops the christians at jerusalem conformed to the laws of moses which made them in outward appearance just like the rest of the jews which must have made them harder to notice the gospel when first propagated seemed to ignore the great or considerable men of this world would it be surprising if they in turn overlooked it as something not suited to their way of thinking he goes on to say that learned jews at that time might well be afraid in one way of writing in favour of christianity and in another way of writing against it so that their safest course was to say nothing about it also the historian gamaliel does mention jesus christ in passing in his account of st jamess death although he shows a respect for the apostle he mentions jesus in a casual and neutral way saying nothing either good or bad about him but he characterizes him as jesus who was called the christ not who claimed to be the christ or who was falsely called the christ but simply and then he says it again this time in greek he continues it is evident that josephus knew there was such a man as jesus and that he was said to be the christ and yet he condemns neither him nor his followers which i see as evidence in their favour if josephus had known or been convinced that jesus was an impostor of course he would have said so plainly i cant understand why any man should conclude against the truth of the gospel from josephuss omitting to speak of it any more than from his omitting to accept it if the first christians been chief priests and rulers or men of science and learning it might have been more plausible to contend that their religion was a human construct than it is in fact given that it has pleased god to use weak things to confound the strong yet it seems an odd argument in support of any doctrine that it was preached by simple people to simple people it would indeed be a very weak argument if the only testimony to the doctrine came from simple people but what we have here is a doctrine of which this is true its first instruments were people with very few human advantages it made its first progress among people who didnt have wealth skills or power to grace or encourage it in a short time through its own innate excellence and the mighty force of miracles and the demonstration of the holy spirit it spread throughout the world and subdued men of all ranks and conditions of life doing this not only with no support from all worldly motives but positively against such motives isnt it very unreasonable to reject or suspect such a doctrine on the grounds that its human means are lowly mightnt this with much better reason be thought to be evidence that the doctrine comes from god alciphron replies that real inquirers will demand testimony from learned men there has been plenty of that but their testimony is suspect because they were prejudiced christians and therefore their testimony is to be suspected you are demanding evidence of the truth of christianity from people who didnt believe it this isnt reasonable they kick this topic around for a while and then a dispute starts up concerning how much respect the early church fathers deserve alciphron says that even if he did give weight to early christian writings the great number of forgeries and heresies that sprung up in those times would considerably take away from that weight let us suppose something that you do agree to be possible namely that there is a god a devil and a revelation from heaven that was committed to writing many centuries ago on the basis of that supposition take a look at human nature and ask what would probably follow if the supposition were fact isnt it very likely there would be halfbelievers mistaken bigots holy frauds men who were ambitious selfinterested disputing conceited schismatic heretical absurd among those who announced themselves as believers in this revealed religion and isnt it also very likely that after a few centuries there would be various readings omissions transpositions and obscurities in the text of the sacred oracles you be the judge is it reasonable to treat as an objection to something a course of events that would probably and naturally follow if the thing in question did exist well say what you will this variety of opinions must shake the faith of a reasonable man where there are so many different opinions on the same point its very certain that they cant all be true but its certain that they can all be false and the means we have to use to find out the truth when a man of sense embarks on this inquiry he finds himself suddenly startled and thrown offbalance by hard words and knotty questions this makes him abandon the pursuit thinking the game not worth the chase crito replies that differences of opinion and the formation of sects occurs in all branches of human studyhe cites law medicine and politicsand this doesnt deter us from thinking that there are good rules sound ideas and useful truths in all those disciplines he develops this approach in connection with medicine remarking that real discoveries have been made despite the hard words and knotty questions that have arisen on the way to them then after a brief exchange of insults crito turns to the question of schisms and subsects but to return what profession of men is there who never split into schisms and never talk nonsense isnt it obvious that out of all the kinds of knowledge on which the human mind is employed there grow certain excrescences that can safely be pared off as we pare our fingernails under all that rubbishy stuff it is certain that the faith derived from christ and his apostles was not a piece of empty sophistry and to claim to demolish the foundation of faith for the sake of the superstructure that humans have built is a sign of poor thinking and its a sign of unfairness to suppose that a doubtful sense is fixed and argue from one side of the question in disputed points such questions as should the beginning of genesis be understood in a literal or an allegorical sense is the book of job a history or a parable are disputed amongst christians so an unbeliever has no right to argue from one side of any of them what we are arguing for now is not this or that tenet of a sect this or that controversial idea but rather the general faith taught by christ and his apostles and preserved by universal and perpetual tradition in all the churches down to our own times to attack this divine doctrine on account of things that come not from within the doctrine but from external sources such as the theories and disputes of men strikes me as an absurdity comparable with cutting down a fine tree that provides fruit and shade because its leaves give nourishment to caterpillars or because spiders sometimes weave cobwebs among the branches after an exchange focussing on the question of how clever men ought to spend their time but after all the examination and inquiry that mortal man can make about revealed religion it is impossible to reach any rational sure footing we are told strange things that are said to be proved by the fact that men have laid down their lives for them but it is perfectly conceivableindeed it has often happenedthat men have died for the sake of false beliefs that they used to hold you may indeed find examples of men dying for falsehoods that they believed but can you find a case of a mans dying for the sake of a proposition that he didnt believe of course not it is inconceivable yet this must be what happened if the witnesses of christs miracles and resurrection were impostors there is indeed a great deal of glittery talk about faith based on miracles but when i examine this matter thoroughly and track the christian faith back to its origins i find that it is really based on darkness and hesitation and uncertainty instead of propositions that are evident or at least agreeable to human reason i find an astonishing narrative of the son of god tempted in the wilderness by the devilsomething utterly unexplainable having absolutely no purpose or use or reason i meet with strange stories of angels appearing voices from heaven demonsthings quite out of line with common sense and common experiencealong with a number of incredible feats said to have been done by divine power but more probably the inventions of men and not made less likely to be so by my complete inability to guess why they were invented deeply laid plans are dark and the less we know the more we suspect but even if all those stories are true i shant accept that they were miraculous until i have a thorough knowledge of ordinary natural causes and of the force of magic it seems to me alciphron that what you are analysing is not faith but infidelity lack of faith and that you are tracing it back to its sources which judging from your own account i understand to be dark and doubtful worries and surmises hastiness in judging and narrowness in thinking and all this is based on your fantastic overrating of your own scrap of experience and on real ignorance of the views of god and of the qualities operations and interrelations of the many fundamentally different kinds of beings that exist in the universe or that you dont know dont exist thats what the sources of unbelief are likeobscure uncertain fanciful and conjectural whereas the sources of faith are propositions that seem to me plain and clear there is nothing unclear about these this faith in christ was spread throughout the world soon after his death that wasnt brought about by human learning politics or power in the churchs early years many knowledgeable and honest men accepted this faith not from some but against all worldly motives the nearer those men were to the fountainhead of christianity the better chance they had to check on the truth of the propositions that they believed the less it was in their selfinterest to be persuaded the more need there was for evidence to convince them they relied on the authority of people who declared themselves eyewitnesses of the miracles and resurrection of christ those professed eyewitnesses suffered greatly through giving this testimony and finally they sealed it with their blood those witnesses weak and unimportant as they were overcame the worldspread more light preached purer morals and did more benefit to mankind than all the philosophers and wise men put together if these propositions are clear and sure as they seem to me to be they constitute plain just and reasonable grounds for assent to the christian faith they dont rest on any falsehoods they dont contain anything beyond our sphere because they dont presuppose more knowledge than we have or better faculties than we are actually equipped with and even if they arent accepted as morally certain as i think they will be by fair and unprejudiced inquirers even accepting them as only probable is sufficient to stop the mouth of an unbeliever morally certain means certain enough for all practical purposes its a bit vague but is stronger than only probable the pillars of our faith are the above eight plain propositions and not the obscure ones that you supposed which are in fact the unsound uncertain sources of unbelief in a rash prejudiced and assuming mind to argue or counterargue on the basis that a supposed miracle might be explained by hidden powers of nature or by magic is groping in the dark but by the evident light of their senses men can be sure enough about perceptible effects and matters of fact such as the miracles and the resurrection of christ and the testimony of such men can be passed on through centuries with the same moral certainty as can other historical narrations and those same miraculous facts when reason has related them to the doctrines they were brought to prove provide an unbiased mind with strong indications that they have come from god or from a superior source as for the fact that jews and gentiles back then attributed our saviours miracles to magicdo you count that as evidence against the miracles it seems to be to be positive evidence that those events did occur it doesnt square with the christian account of what caused them but it doesnt bring any evidence against that account as for the nature and operations of demons the history laws and system of rational beings and gods schemes or viewswe dont claim to know enough about all this to account for every action and appearance recorded in the gospel but you dont know enough of those things to be entitled to object against accounts that are so well supported by testimony its easy to raise doubts regarding many authentic parts of civil historyevents that we find inexplicable because the explanation of them requires more knowledge than we have of facts circumstances and councils and its even easier with respect to natural history in that field if surmises were accepted as evidence against things that are odd strange and inexplicable if our slight experience were made the rule and measure of truth and no phenomenon was accepted unless we with our ignorance of the principles laws and system of nature could explain it we would make discoveries all rightdiscoveries about our own blindness and presumption something that i cant begin to explain by any rules of logic and good sense is why men who are so easily and so often floored by problems about the natural visible world should yet be so sharpsighted and dogmatic about the invisible world and its mysteries i expect that ill always be in the darkas you put itabout the evidence for the christian religion and always presume there isnt any for how is it possible at this remote distance in time to arrive at any knowledge or conduct any demonstrations about it what of it i admit that knowledge in a strict sense cant be had except of something that is either selfevident or demonstrated but probable arguments are a sufficient basis for faith who ever thought that rigorous proofs are necessary to make a christian all that is needed is faith and provided that men are convinced in the main and on the whole this saving faith can be consistent with some degrees of obscurity doubt and error for although the light of truth is unchangeable in its eternal source the father of lights in relation to us it is variously weakened and obscured by passing across a long distance or through a thick medium in which it is intercepted distorted or tinted by mens prejudices and passions but despite all this if you will use your eyes you can see enough for the purposes either of nature or of grace although the light you see by is dimmer or brighter depending on the place the distance the time of day and the medium and although there may be much that we cant explain in the realms of nature and of grace all that is required for faith to be maintained is that the two should exhibit enough analogy to make it probable that they have the same author are the workmanship of one and the same hand those who saw touched and handled jesus christ after his resurrection if anyone did may be said to have seen by a clear light but to us the light is very dim and yet we are expected to believe in the resurrection just as they did for my part i agree with spinoza that christs death was literal but his resurrection was allegorical and for my part i cant see anything in this celebrated unbeliever that should make me desert matters of fact and moral evidence so as to adopt his ideas throughout this paragraph evidence means evidentness in this usage the evidence of proposition p refers to how evident p is its not about evidence for p so matters of fact and moral evidence means matters of fact and propositions that are morally evident re morally see the note on page i do have to allow a certain allegorical resurrection i mean the resurrection of christs disciples from weakness to resolution from fear to courage from despair to hope and that allegorical resurrection is evidence for the real one because i cant see how those changes in the disciples can be explained except by supposing that they knew through their own senses that our lord had truly really literally risen from the dead it cant be denied that his disciples who were eyewitnesses of his miracles and resurrection had stronger evidence than we can have of those matters but it also cant be denied that at that time there was a correspondingly greater need for evidence to induce men to embrace a new institution that was contrary to the whole system of their upbringing their prejudices their passions their interests and every human motive still it seems to me that the moral evidence and probable arguments that are within our reach are quite enough to make prudent thinking men keep to the faith that has been handed down to us from our ancestors and established by the laws of our countrya faith requiring submission on matters that are above our knowledge and for the rest recommending doctrines that best fit our interests and our reason he goes on to talk about the advantage that we have of being able to look back at the history of the world during the christian period and seeing gods plans a work in it then we can behold christ crucified that stumblingblock to the jews and foolishness to the greeks putting an end to the temple worship of the one and the idolatry of the other but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness corinthians if a due reflection on these things isnt enough to create a reverence for the christian faith in the minds of men why would that be because men have a wise and cautious incredulity anything but that consider how easily men have faith during their daily doings where there is no prejudice or appetite to bias or disturb their natural judgment the men who in matters of religion wont move an inch unless things are made evident to them and at every turn expect demonstration trust their health to a physician and their lives to a sailor with complete faith i cant think they deserve the honour of being thought harder to convince than other men or that they are more accustomed to know and therefore less inclined to believe on the contrary its tempting to suspect that our modern unbelief owes more to ignorance than to knowledge this leads to squabbles with lysicles about attitudes to careful scholarship and then about the legitimacy of attacking christianity by jokes and puns and innuendo euphranor joins in on that last topic and so finally does although i am a declared admirer of reason a worshipper of reason i have to admit that in some cases the sharpness of ridicule can do more than the strength of argument but if freethinkers sometimes use mirth and humour its not because we have no other weapons it shall never be said that a freethinker was afraid of reasoning no crito we have reasons in store the best are yet to come and if we can find an hour for another conversation before lysicles and i set out for london tomorrow morning ill undertake to supply you with reasons that are as clear effective and close to the point as you could wish seventh dialogue tuesday we assembled at break of day in the library alciphron began with a declaration of his sincerity assuring us he had very maturely and with a most unbiased mind considered everything that had been said the day before he added that a number of probable reasons had been given for accepting the christian faith but he said because those reasons are only probable they cant overcome absolute certainty and demonstration so if i can demonstrate rigorously prove that your religion is absurd and inconsistent your probable arguments in defence of it instantly lose their force and with it all right to be answered or considered when sincere and able witnesses give the same testimony that certainly has great weight in human affairs it can even have enough weight to claim our acceptance of things that are odd and out of line with human judgment and or experience i will also concede that it is possible for a traditionie a chain of testimoniesto be conveyed with moral evidence see note on page through many centuries but you must concede that something thats demonstrably and obviously false shouldnt be accepted on the strength of any testimony whatever because however good testimony is it cant amount to demonstration to be plain no testimony can turn nonsense into sense no moral evidence can make contradictions consistent well then because the strength of our cause doesnt depend on critical points of history chronology or languages it cant be decided by any such points dont be surprised if the same kind of tradition that governs our assent with respect to facts in civil or natural history is not accepted as sufficient support for metaphysical absurdities and absolute impossibilities things that are obscure and unaccountable in human affairs or the operations of nature may nevertheless be possible and if the testimony to them is good enough they may be assented to but religious assent or faith can be plainly shown to be intrinsically impracticable impossible and absurd this is the primary reason for unbelief this is our citadel and fortress it may indeed be ornamented with extra turrets and supplementary walls of learnedness of various sorts but if those are demolished the fortress still stands its own strength makes it impregnable well i have to admit that this shrinks our field of inquiry considerably if you make good on what you have just said ill have nothing more to say it is easy to fool the shallow mind of the vulgar because it attends only to the surfaces of things and thinks about them not in detail but en bloc and so we find a blind reverence for religious faith and mystery but when a sharp philosopher comes to dissect and analyse these items of faith the deceit plainly appears and because he isnt blind he has no reverence for empty notionsor more accurately for mere forms of speech that mean nothing and are of no use to mankind the long speech that follows involves a theory of meaning and understanding that was widely accepted at the time its principal source is the third book of lockes essay concerning human understanding words are signs they stand for ideas or they ought to and so far as they suggest ideas they are significant words that dont suggest any ideas are insignificant someone who associates a clear idea with each word that he uses speaks sense and when such ideas are lacking the speaker utters nonsense so if we want to know whether someones speech is senseless and insignificant all we need do is to set aside the words and consider the ideas suggested by them because men cant immediately communicate their ideas to one another they have to use sensible signs or words the purpose of which is to raise in the hearers mind the ideas that are already are in the speakers and if they fail to do this they are useless for someone to count as understanding what he reads or hears he must have a sequence of ideas raised in his mind corresponding to the sequence of words that he has read or heard these are plain truths that men readily assent to in theory but they arent much attended to in practice so they deserve to be expounded in detail and drummed into people however obvious and undeniable they may be people in general dont much like thinking but they dont mind speaking and listening to the speech of others and the effect of that is that their minds are stored with names rather than ideas the husk of knowledge rather than knowledge itself and yet these words without meaning are often what mark off one party or sect or group of partisans from another forming the subject matter of their disputes and the object of their zeal this is the most general cause of error and it isnt restricted to ordinary minds even people who are regarded as acute and learned philosophers are often busy working at names instead of things or ideas and are thought to be expressing knowledge when really they are only uttering hard words without a meaning knowledge is the perception of the connection or disagreement between ideas and someone who doesnt distinctly perceive the ideas associated with the terms cant form a mental proposition corresponding to the verbal one so obviously that person cant possibly have knowledge he cant even be said to have opinion or faith these imply a weaker assent than knowledge does but it still has to be assent to a proposition and although the agreement or disagreement of the ideas wont be as evident as in the case of knowledge the terms of the verbal proposition have to be understood just as clearly as they are in knowledge which means that the conventionally associated ideas must be clearly in the persons mind ill say it again all degrees of assentwhether based on reason or authority and wherever they are on the spectrum from i am compelled to believe this at one end to i am faintly more inclined to accept this than to deny it at the otherare internal acts of the mind that are directed at ideas without which there really cant be any such thing as knowledge faith or opinion we can perhaps raise a dust by arguing with one another about purely verbal propositions but that is mere trifling all this will be readily agreed to with respect to human learning and science here abstract theoretically organised and deductively interlocked bodies of knowledge because in that domain it is a generally accepted method of exposing any doctrine or thesis to strip off its words and examine what ideasif anyare underneath this is often found to be the shortest way to end disputes which might otherwise grow and multiply without end with the disputants not understanding one another or themselves i neednt give examples this doctrine about meaning and understanding shines by its own light and is accepted by all thinking men what i shall do is to apply the doctrine to our present topic i hope i dont need to argue that the rules of reason and good sense that hold sway in all other subjects ought to be applied in religion also well there are those who consider faith and reason to be two distinct domains and want us to think that good sense has nothing to do with the domain of faithwhich is in fact the region where it has most to do i have decided never to argue with such men but leave them peacefully in possession of their prejudices in applying what i have said about ideas and understanding to issues in religion i shant single out any nitpicking disputes in academic theology nor shall i pick on any doctrines concerning the nature and essence of god because you might counter what i said about any of those by claiming that god is infinite and that the problem i had raised was part of our general difficulty in grasping the nature of infinity the central item in the christian dispensation is grace nothing is mentioned or considered more often than grace is throughout the new testament which represents it as something of a very special kind distinct from anything revealed to the jews or known by the light of nature this same grace is spoken of as the gift of god as coming through jesus christ as reigning as abounding as operating men are said to speak through grace and to believe through grace mention is made of the glory of grace the riches of grace the stewards of grace christians are said to be heirs of grace to receive grace grow in grace be strong in grace to stand in grace and to fall from grace and lastly grace is said to justify and to save them hence christianity is styled the covenant or dispensation of grace meaning that christianity rests on promises that god has made through grace and favours that he has given through grace and its well known that no point has created more controversy in the church than this doctrine of grace there have been many disputes about the nature extent and effects of grace and about the kinds of graceuniversal efficacious sufficient preventing and irresistible that have employed the pens of protestant as well as roman catholic theologians and he reels off the names of several christian sects im not even slightly interested in just what these disputes have been so i shant try to list them now all i need to make my point is that great contests on these points have existed and still continue what i would like to be told is the answer to this what is the clear and distinct idea associated with the word grace presumably one can know the bare meaning of a term without going into the depth of all those learned inquiries and controversies this is surely an easy matter provided there is an idea connected to the term and if there isnt it cant be a subject of a rational dispute or an object of real faith of course men may indeed deceive themselves or others by claiming to argue and believe when basically there is no argument or belief that goes beyond mere verbal trifling i can easily understand grace in one of its everyday nonreligious senses grace meaning beauty a blushing womanly grace and grace meaning favour the signs of grace that the queen showed to raleigh but when grace names an active vital ruling principle roughly source of energy or activity see b in euphranors speech on pages influencing and operating on the mind of man and distinct from every natural power or motive i declare that i cant understand it or form any distinct idea of it and therefore i cant assent to any proposition about it and so i cant have any faith regarding it and its a selfevident truth that god doesnt require anyone to do what he cant do when alciphron talks of a word as signifying a distinct idea he may mean that the idea is intrinsically clear or that the idea is distinct from all ideas associated with other words or both in this version distinct will be allowed to stand unexplained a philosophical friend of mine asked me to look at the writings of some theologians that he showed me which i did and i also talked with others on this subject but after all my reading and conversations i could make nothing of it whenever i set aside the word grace and looked into my own mind i found a complete absence of ideas and because i suspect that mens minds and abilities are much alike i suspect that other men if they examined what they call grace with the same exactness and lack of bias would agree with me that there was nothing to it but an empty name this isnt the only example of a meaningless word that is often heard and spoken but is believed to be intelligible simply because it is familiar there are many others that occur in sentences that are said to express necessary articles of faith the fraud that grace imposes on mankind is i think partly the following men speak of this holy principle as of something that acts moves and makes things happen taking their ideas from physical thingsfrom motion and the force or momentum of bodies because bodies are obvious and perceptible men put them in place of grace a spiritual and incomprehensible thing that is clearly a delusion even if our idea of bodily force is ever so clear and intelligible it doesnt follow that the idea of grace a supposed force but one that has nothing bodily about it must be clear and intelligible too and though we can reason clearly perceive assent and form opinions about bodily force it doesnt at all follow that we can do the same regarding grace and so it comes about that a clear sensebased idea of something real producesor rather is made a pretence foran imaginary spiritual faith that isnt actually about anything i call the faith imaginary because it isnt possible for it to be real where there are no ideas there cant be any assent and where there is no assent there cant be any faith and if something is impossible no man can be obliged to have it or do itthats as clear as anything in euclid whatever it is that words are used for i cant believe that they are used to do impossible things so let us look into what they are used for and see if we can make sense of our daily practice words it is agreed are signs so it might be as well to examine the use of other signs so as to understand the use of words counters at a cardtable are used not for their own sake but only as signs substituted for money as words are substituted for ideas tell me alciphron is it necessary every time these counters are used throughout the game to form an idea of the precise amount of money that each represents by no means all thats needed is that the players agree on their respective values at the outset and cash them in at those values when the game is over and in adding up some numbers where the figures stand for pounds shillings and pence do you think its necessary to form ideas of pounds shillings and pence at each step in the operation i dont all that is required is for the figures on the bottom line to direct our actions appropriately with respect to things it seems to follow from this that words can be significant even if they dont every time they are used arouse in our minds the ideas that they signify because its enough for meaningfulness if we have it in our power to substitute things or ideas for the words when there is a call for it it seems to follow also that words have a use additional to that of marking and suggesting distinct ideas namely influencing our behaviour and there are two ways for them to do thatforming rules for us to act by and arousing certain passions dispositions and emotions in our minds so it seems that a discourse that tells us how to act or spurs the doing or notdoing of an action can be useful and significant even if the words making it up dont each bring a distinct idea into our minds it seems so tell me alciphron isnt an idea altogether inactive it is so an agentsomething that does things an active mind or spiritcant be an idea and cant be like an idea from which it would seem to follow that the words that stand for an active principle soul or spirit dont stand for ideas in the strict and proper sense of ideas but they arent insignificant or meaningless as i can show through one really striking example namely the word i or the word myself as used by me i understand what it signifies i know what it means but what it signifies isnt an idea and isnt like an idearather it is something that thinks and wills and grasps ideas and does things with them it cant be denied that we know what is meant by the terms myself will memory love hate and so forthwe have some notion that we understand relating to themeven though strictly speaking these words dont suggest distinct ideas to us in this version of the seventh dialogue the uses of idea and notion will exactly track berkeleys what would you infer from this what i have inferred already namely that words can be significant without standing for ideas its because people thought otherwise that the doctrine of abstract ideas has arisen do you deny that the mind can abstract i dont deny that it can abstract in a certain sense of that word we can think about one thing separately from another if but only if they could exist separately and could be perceived separately so we can abstract by thinking about a mans head and not about his body or think about colour without thinking about motion or think about shape without thinking about weight but it doesnt follow from this that the mind can frame abstract general ideaseg thinking about colour without thinking about any specific huewhich appear to be impossible yet it is generally thought these days that every noun replacing substantive name here and throughout marks out and exhibits to the mind one distinct idea separate from all others tell me alciphron isnt the word number a noun it is well now see if you can form an idea of number in abstractnot bringing verbal signs or things that are numbered speaking for myself i cant can it be so difficult to form a simple idea of number which is the subjectmatter of a most evident demonstrable science wait a bit let me see if i cant abstract the idea of number from numberwords and numerals and from all particular countable things long pause to tell the truth i dont find that i can apparently then neither you nor i can form distinct simple ideas of number and yet we can make a very proper and significant use of numberwords and numerals they direct us in the management of our affairs and do it in such an essential way that we would be lost without them and yet if other mens abilities are like mine achieving a precise simple abstract idea of number is as difficult as is comprehending any mystery in religion to come now to your example let us examine what idea we can form of force abstracted from body motion and outward perceptible effects speaking again for myself i dont find that i have or can have any such idea surely everyone knows what is meant by force and yet i question whether everyone can form a distinct idea of force i beg you alciphron dont be distracted by words set aside the word force and exclude everything else from your thoughts and then see what precise idea you have of force force is that in bodies which produces motion and other perceptible effects it is then something distinct from those effects it is well then please now set aside any thought of the thing that has the force and the effects that follow from it and contemplate force itself through its own precise idea i have to say that i find it difficult shut your eyes to assist your meditation alciphron closed his eyes and thought for a few minutes and then declared that he couldnt do it well then replied euphranor there is something that it seems neither you nor i can form an idea of and your own remark that mens minds and abilities are much alike implies that noone else has any more of an idea of it than we do it does and yet there are certainly many speculations reasonings and disputes refined subtleties and intricate distinctions relating to this same force and to explain its nature and mark out the different notions of it or kinds of it learned men have used the terms gravity reaction inertial force inherent force immediate force dead force live force momentum solicitatio conatus and various other such expressions and big controversies have arisen about the notions or definitions of these terms men had wanted to know whether force is spiritual or bodily whether it remains after action how it is transferred from one body to another strange paradoxes have been concocted about its nature properties and proportions for instance that opposite forces can exist at the same time in the same quiescent body that the force of percussion in a small particle is infinite he names a book in which details can be found and goes on at some length about controversies between leibniz and others over forces in physics then the ingenious toricelli says concerning the momentum and the velocity of heavy falling bodies that they are a certain something and an idontknowwhat what does all this tell us about the idea of forcejust force itself setting aside body time space motion and all the perceptible measures of force cant we say that its as difficult to form an idea of force as to form an idea of grace i dont know what to think about that but i presume youll agree that some propositions or theorems relating to force are obviously true and also useful for instance what berkeley wrote that a body with conjunct forces describes the diagonal of a parallelogram in the same time that it would the sides with separate what he ought to have meant if a body is subject to two forces represent them by two lines drawn from a single pointdirection representing direction and length representing strength add two more lines to complete a parallelogram the resultant force on the body is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram isnt this theorem very widely useful doesnt the doctrine of the composition and resolution of forces depend on it and through that countless rules and theorems telling us how to act and explaining phenomena all through mechanics and mathematical physics and if this theorem helps men to get the knowledge of many inventions in mechanics and teaches them how to make engines that they can use to do things that are otherwise hard or impossible and provides a key to discovering the nature of planetary motions in addition to all its usefulness here on earth are we going to say that it is not practically or theoretically useful because we have no distinct idea of force obviously not well given that we take that line with force what excuse have we for going a different way with grace if there are queries disputes perplexities and diverging notions and opinions about grace so there are about force also if we cant form any precise distinct idea of grace neither can we of force oughtnt we by parity of reasoning to conclude that there may be various true and useful propositions about grace just as there are about force and oughtnt you also to conclude that grace may for all you know to the contrary be an object of our faith and influence our life and actions by attacking evil habits and supporting good ones even though we cant get a distinct idea of grace all on its own separated or abstracted from god who produces it man who receives it and virtue and piety that result from it shant we allow the same method of arguing the same rules of logic reason and good sense to hold sway in spiritual matters as in physical ones in faith as well as in physics and when we are examining gods revelations shant we use the same candour and make the same allowances as we do when examining the discoveries of men i cant see how a philosopher can be free from bias and prejudice or be said to weigh things in an equal balance if he maintains the doctrine of force and rejects that of grace or admits the abstract idea of triangle while ridiculing the holy trinity anyway however partial or prejudiced other minute philosophers may be you have laid it down as a maxim that the same logic which governs in other matters must be admitted in religion alciphron i think youd do better to stay with the method of wit and humour rather than trying religion by the dry test of reason and logic dont worry by all the rules of right reason it is absolutely impossible that any mysteryespecially the trinityshould really be the object of mans faith im not surprised that you thought so while you held that noone could assent to a verbal proposition without forming in his mind distinct ideas associated with the words in it but you have agreed that those signs can be significant even if they dont suggest ideas represented by them provided they serve to regulate and influence our wills passions or behaviour which commits you to agreeing also that a mans mind can assent to propositions containing such terms when it is directed or affected by them even if it doesnt perceive in itself distinct ideas marked by those terms it seems to follow from this that a man can believe the doctrine of the trinity if he finds it revealed in the bible that the father the son and the holy ghost are god and that there is only one god he can believe this doctrine of a creator redeemer and sanctifier three persons making one substanceeven though he doesnt form in his mind any abstract or distinct ideas of trinity person or substance provided that the doctrine has the right effect on his mind producing in it love hope gratitude and obedience thereby becoming a lively operative principle that influences his life and actions in ways that fit with the notion of saving faith that is required in a christian whether this is right or wrong it seems to follow from what you have declared together with what you have conceded i wonder if there is anything parallel to this christian faith in the minute philosophy suppose a fine gentleman or lady of fashion who are too busy to think for themselves and are only freethinkers at secondhand have the advantage of being initiated quite early into the principles of your sect by listening to men of depth and genius who have often expressed the opinion that the world is governed either by fate or by chance and it doesnt matter which see qa note on page i you wont deny that it is possible for such persons to give their assent to either of these propositions the fate one and the chance one ii and their assent can properly be called faith iii and yet these disciples of the minute philosophy may be unable to dive deep enough to form any abstract or precise or definite idea of fate or of chance iv so that this same gentleman or lady may be said to believe or have faith where they dont have ideas v and this faith or conviction can produce real effects showing itself in the conduct and tone of their lives freeing them from the fears of superstition and giving them a true liking for the world with a noble indifference about any afterlife and cant christians with equal reason be allowed to believe in the divinity of our saviour or believe that in him god and man make one person and be genuinely convinced of this so that this faith or belief becomes a real principle of life and conduct because of this belief that they have they submit to his government believe his doctrine and behave according to his precepts even though they dont form any abstract idea of the union between the divine and human nature and even though they cant clear up the notion of person in a way that will satisfy a minute philosopher it seems obvious to me that we wouldnt so often be faced with a demand for a clear and distinct idea of person in relation to the trinity and wouldnt so often find difficulties about this being treated as objections to our faith if these demands and objections were made only by people who had delicately examined and could themselves explain the principle of individuation in man or could untie the knots and answer the objections that can be raised even about human personal identity alciphron says that he doesnt think there is any great mystery in personal identity and expresses agreement with lockes theory about this that is an opening for euphranor to argue against lockes thesis that as euphranor puts it personal identity consists in consciousness the argument is not worth much as it is based on a stunningly absurdly uncharitable reading of locke it was launched by reid essays on the intellectual powers of man essay chapter anyway this interchange contributes nothing to the rest of the dialogue which euphranor puts back on track thus there is i think a practical kind of faith or assent that shows itself in the will and actions of a man even if his understanding isnt furnished with corresponding abstract precise distinct ideas you indeed have conceded that there are many instances of such practical faith in other matters that dont involve religion so why shouldnt it be that doctrines relating to heavenly mysteries might also be taught in this saving sense to common minds that you may well think incapable of all teaching and faith of the sort you have been demanding this mistaken view of teaching and faith said crito has led to a great deal of profane and misapplied sarcasm but all that can fairly bounced back onto the minute philosophers themselves who muddle scholasticism with christianity and impute to other men the perplexities chimeras and inconsistent ideas that are often the work of their own brains and argue on the basis of their own wrong way of thinking anyone can see that such an ideal abstracted faith is never thought of by the great majority of christiansfarmers for example and artisans and servants and theres nothing in the bible to suggest that either jews or christians are required to engage in the delicately precise forming of abstract ideas nothing like this is to be found in the law or the prophets the evangelists or the apostles everyone whose understanding is not perverted by science falsely so called can see that the saving faith of christians is of quite another kind a vital operative principle roughly source of energy or activity see b in euphranors speech on pages that generates charity and obedience then what can we make of the disputes and decisions of the famous council of nicaea which drew up the socalled nicene creed and all the councils since that one what was the intention of those venerable fathers the homoousians and the homoiousians why did they disturb themselves and the world with hard words and subtle controversies those are greek words meaning respectively the same and similar the controversy was between two views about the relationship of the son to the father whatever their intention was it couldnt have been to do something that is obviously impossiblenamely create precise abstracted ideas of mysteries in the minds of common christians theres no evidence that the majority of christians in those days thought they were obliged to set aside words shut their eyes and form abstract ideas any more than men now form abstract ideas of force time number or many other things about which they nevertheless believe know argue and dispute it seems to me that whatever was the source of that controversy and however it was conducted what it was really about was not a desire by either side to convey precise positive ideas to the minds of men by the use of those controversial terms but rather something negativenamely a desire to exclude on one side the view that there are three gods and on the other the view that there is just one god of whom the father the son and the holy ghost are merely three aspects but so many learned and ingenious theologians have from time to time offered the world new explanations of mysteries claiming to have worked to get accurate ideas and wanting to recommend their discoveries and speculations to others as articles of faith what are we to make of them to all such innovators in religion i would say with hieronymus why after so many centuries do you claim to teach us something that hasnt been taught before why explain things that neither peter nor paul thought needed to be explained the explanation of mysteries in divinity is as futile as the pursuit of the philosophers stone see note on page in chemistry or the perpetual motion machine in mechanics but in each of the three cases the absurdity is to be blamed not on that branch of enquiry but only on wrongheaded people engaged in it what euphranor has been saying seems to be applicable also to other mysteries of our religion we may find it impossible to form an abstracted idea of original sin for example or an idea of how original sin is passed on from adam to the rest of us but the belief in it may produce in someones mind a salutary sense of his own unworthiness and of the goodness of his redeemer and from that may follow good habits and from them good actions which are the genuine effects of faith when faith is considered in its true light it can be seen to be neither inconsistent nor incomprehensible as some men want us to think it is but suited even to common capacities placed in the will and affections rather than in the understanding and producing holy lives rather than subtle theories faith isnt something you passively let flow into you its an operative conviction of mind which always produces some suitable action disposition or emotion in those who have it i could easily prove and illustrate this by countless instances taken from human affairs and indeed while the christian religion is considered as an institution fitted to ordinary minds rather than to the minds of hairsplitting theoreticians and while our notions about faith are accordingly taken from mankinds ordinary everyday life rather than from the special systems of faithimprovers i dont think it will be hard to understand the meaning and use of our belief in mysteries and to justify them against the most confident assertions and objections of the minute philosophers who can easily be caught in the very traps that they have set for others and that spirit of controversythe mother and nurse of heresieswould doubtless be much reduced if men would grasp that things should be rated not by their colour shape or trademark so truly as by their weight if some litigious theologians had proportioned their zeal to the importance of the opinions they were propounding that would greatly reduce the zealous intensity of most of what they had to say which would have spared them and us a great deal of trouble someone who takes his notions of faith opinion and assent from common sense and common usage and has maturely weighed the nature of signs and of language wont be so ready to quarrel about the wording of a mystery or to break the peace of the church so as to retain or reject a word heres a plain example that should convince you of the effective and necessary use of faith without ideas the example concerns a convinced minute philosopher a coarse and callous man with large appetites and not much money who has an opportunity to perform one villainous act that will make him richan act that he knows he can get away with what is there to deter him certainly not a sense of the beauty of virtue see alciphrons speech on pages in fact the only way to get some moral leverage on this man is to produce in him a sincere belief in a future state although it is a mystery although it is what eye has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive corinthians this belief will restrain him from carrying out his wicked project to a reasonable reflective philosophical mind the points insisted on by your refined beautyofvirtue moralists may be as lovely and excellent as you please but i venture to say that given mankind as it is very few people would be influenced by them so we see the necessary use of faith as well as its powerful effects and none of this involves having ideas you and euphranor apparently want to convince me that the belief in mysteries doesnt involve anything as utterly absurd as we are apt to think and that a man neednt renounce his reason to maintain his religion but if this is true why is it that mens faith dwindles in proportion as their knowledge grows i have learned from you alciphron that there is nothing like getting to the bottom of things and analysing them into their basic elements so ill try to do that with the question of the nature of faithyoull have to judge whether i succeed the objections that are made to faith dont come from knowledge but rather from ignorance of what knowledge is and that ignorance might be found even in people who are regarded as masters of this or that particular branch of knowledge science and faith have this in common they both involve an assent of the mind and as the nature of scientific assent is most clear and evident we should consider it first in order to cast a light on the assent involved in faith to trace things back to their origins the human mind needs aids that are not part of its basic natural equipment it is naturally furnished with the ideas of particular and concrete as distinct from abstract things and what its designed for is not merely being aware of its ideas but pursuing its own happiness by actively operating on the basis of them for the scientific pursuit of knowledge about the origins of things therefore the mind needs extra help specifically it needs certain general rules or theorems to guide it in this pursuit and the true original reasonable end of studying the arts and sciences is to acquire such rules because these rules are general they cant be obtained by the mere consideration of the original ideas or particular things but only by means of marks or signs and these being general in the sense that they are used for general purposes become the immediate instruments and materials of science so the mind makes its progress not by mere contemplation of particular things even less by contemplating abstract general ideas of things but by appropriately choosing and skillfully managing signs for example everyone knows about force and number in concrete situations along with things that accompany them things that have them and signs of them and noone has any understanding of force and number considered in the abstract and captured in precise abstract ideas so its clear that their abstract nature isnt a foundation for science and that merely considering their ideas in their concrete form isnt the way to advance in the respective sciences of physics and mathematics because nothing is more evident than that someone who cant read or write understands the meanings of numeral words in concrete situations as well as the best scientist or mathematician but here lies the difference the one who understands the notation of numbers can use it to express briefly and clearly all the variety and degrees of number and to perform easily and quickly many arithmetical operations by the help of general rules its obvious how useful these operations are in human life and equally obvious that performing them requires having an appropriate notation if mankind were in a very primitive state with no use of language they wouldnt know any truths of arithmetic their first step towards that science would be the acquisition of names for numbers so that they could signify numbers as high as you like by repeating those names in a certain order the next step would be to associate those names with visible markspermanent ones not like sounds which dont last if this system of marking this notation was done well it would make it easier for us to discover and apply general rules to assist the mind in reasoning and judging and in extending recording and communicating its knowledge about numbers what the mind is immediately concerned with in these activities are the signs or numerals through which it is directed to act in relation to things or number in concrete as the logicians call it without ever considering the simple abstract intellectual general idea of number i dont think it is hard to be convinced that the science of arithmetic is entirely concernedin its rise operations rules and theoremswith the conventional use of signs which are of two sorts names that are words and numerals these names and numerals are in their roles as signs universal the names are related to things the characters are related to the names and both names and characters are related to operations there arent many basic names of numbers the stock of them being enlarged by a certain analogy so a system of characters will be useful to the extent that it is simple and aptly expresses this analogy thus words written at length were less useful than the old roman numerals which in turn were less useful than the modern notation for example two hundred and fortyfour was less useful than ccxliv which was less useful than and the invention of algebraical symbols was a further advance for extensive and general use so there we have it arithmetic and algebra are sciences of great clearness certainty and extent whose immediate topic is signs on the skillful use and management of which they entirely depend perhaps a little attention to them may help us to understand the progress of the mind in other sciences which differ in nature design and purpose but may nevertheless agree in the general methods of proof and inquiry in my view all sciences that are universal and demonstrable by human reason will be found to have signs as their immediate object though in applying a science we connect these signs with things it isnt hard to grasp why this is so nothing is more natural for us than to use the things we do know as stepping stones towards things we dont know and to explain and represent less familiar things by others that are more familiar now it is certain that a before we reflect we imagine and b before we imagine we perceive by our senses and that c of all our senses eyesight is the most clear distinct various agreeable and comprehensive so its natural for us a to help the intellect by imagination b to help imagination by sense and c to help the other senses by sight hence figures metaphors and symbols we illustrate mental things by physical ones we substitute sounds for thoughts and written letters for sounds we use emblems symbols and hieroglyphics for things that are too obscure to strike our minds and too various or too fleeting to be retained we substitute imaginable things for intelligible ones sensible things for imaginable ones smaller things for ones that are too big to comprehend easily and larger things for ones that are too small to be clearly picked out present things for absent ones permanent things for perishing ones and visible things for invisible ones hence the use of models and diagrams thus lines are substituted for time velocity and other things of very different natures thus again we speak of minds in a figurative way describing their operations by terms borrowed from perceptible things such as apprehend conceive reflect discourse and the like apprehend comes from latin meaning seize conceive from take together reflect from bend back discourse from run to and fro euphranor talks a little about allegories eg platos representing the mind by the driver of a winged chariot which etc etc then im inclined to think that the doctrine of signs matters a great deal over a very wide area and that if it were properly considered it would cast a lot of light on things and provide a genuine solution for many difficulties so we can say this much about all signs they dont always suggest ideas signified to the mind when they do suggest ideas they arent general abstract ideas they have other uses such as raising proper emotions producing certain dispositions or habits of mind and directing our actions in pursuit of the happiness that is the ultimate end and design the primary spring and motive that sets rational agents at work the real purpose of speech whether it is being used in reasoning or in expressing theoretical knowledge or faith or some degree of belief is not primarily to give or get ideas but rather to guide actions aimed at bringing about some conceived good sometimes indeed words can lead to suitable actions not merely without communicating any ideas but without such ideas being even possible an example is the algebraic sign standing for the square root of a negative number this is useful in logical operations although it is impossible to have an idea of any such quantity as and what is true of algebraic signs is also true of words or language in fact modern algebra is a languagea compact appropriate artificial sort of languageand any algebraic calculation could be expressed by ordinary words much less conveniently but with nothing left out also theres no avoiding the fact that even the mathematical sciences themselvessupposed to the most clear and certain sciences that we haveoften fall short of the clear and distinct ideas that todays minute philosophers whether knowingly or ignorantly insist on in the mysteries of religion im talking here about mathematics considered as theory not about practical applied mathematics in absolutely any science or field of activity men will be sure to embarrass themselves with difficulties and disputes if they move from particulars to generalities from concrete things to abstractions or relinquish practical views and the useful purposes of knowledge in favour of barren theorising regarding means and instruments as ultimate ends and struggling to get the precise ideas that they suppose to be associated with all words im talking about difficulties and disputes such as the ones that have sprung up in geometry about the nature of the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent proportions indivisibles infinitesimals and various other matters despite all of which geometry itself is rightly admired as an excellent and useful science it really does prove useful in many reallife situations where it governs and directs the actions of men enabling them to do in a sound and accurate way things that would otherwise be faulty and uncertain and by parity of reasoning we shouldnt regard any other doctrines that govern influence or direct the mind of man to be less true or excellent because they provide material for controversy and useless theorizing by troublemakers this applies especially to the articles of our christian faith with regard to which belief leads to persuasion which in turn influences the lives and actions of men as for the perplexity of contradictions and abstracted notions that crop up in secular sciences and divine faith nitpickers may use it as an objection incautious people may stray into it while judicious people keep away from it the belief of christians can be justified without departing from the accepted rules of reasoning and if any pious men think otherwise thats probably a result not of religion or of reason but merely of human weakness if there are especially many unbelievers in our time i shant conclude that our time knows more than former agesonly that it is more arrogantly selfconfident and i dont think that this confidence is a result of much thought it seems to me that the more thoroughly and extensively any man investigates and thinks about the principles aims and methods that occur in secular arts and sciences the more convinced he will be that theres no weight in the plausible objections that are brought against the mysteries of faith and he wont have much difficulty maintaining and justifying his position using accepted methods of argument and the common principles of logic appealing to countless parallel cases all through the many branches of human knowledge in all of which the supposition of abstract ideas creates the same difficulties according to this doctrine anything can be maintained therell be nothing absurd in popery not even in transubstantiation the doctrine that in the sacrament of the eucharist the bread and wine become the body and blood of jesus pardon me what i have been saying doesnt justify any article of faith that isnt contained in scripture is in conflict with human reason implies a contradiction or leads to idolatry or wickedness of any kind those four disqualifiers are very different from not being representable by distinct or abstract ideas ill allow euphranor that your reasoning has all the force you meant it to have i freely admit that there may be mysteries that we can believe things that we dont understand and that faith can be useful even when what its about is not distinctly grasped in short i agree that there can be faith and mysteries in other thingsbut not in religion the plain reason for this is that its absurd to suppose there to be any such thing as religion and if theres no religion then there cant be religious faith or mysteries religion obviously implies the worship of a god which worship presupposes rewards and punishments which presuppose merits and demerits good and evil actions and these presuppose human freedom and that is impossible which means that religion which is built on it must be unreasonable and absurd it cant be reasonable to have fears where there is no guilt and there cant be guilt when everything that happens follows unavoidably from the structure of the world and the laws of motion here is what happens when a man as we say raises his hand to shade his eyes from the sun physical objects strike on his senseorgans specifically lightparticles strike his eyes those organs the eyes start a vibration in the nerves that vibration is passed along to the soul or animal spirits in the brain or root of the nerves see note on page starting up in them the kind of motion called volition the volition starts up a new movement in the animal spirits this causes the spirits to flow into certain nerves the events in those nerves cause bodily movements that constitute the action in question in our case cause his hand to go up over his eyes and all of this happens necessarily by the laws of mechanism so the events that we ordinarily take to be human actions should be regarded as mechanical and its just wrong to think they have a source that is free so there is no basis for praise or blame fear or hope reward or punishment and religion as i have already pointed out is built on and presupposes those things if i have understood you rightly alciphron you regard man as a sort of organ that is played on by external objects which produce different motions and effects in the organ depending on the different shapes and textures of the nerves the comparison with an organ is not bad but the best comparison is with a puppet certain particles coming in straight lines from all perceptible objects compose so many rays or filaments that push pull and activate every part of the soul and body of man just as threads or wires operate on the joints of the little wooden machine ordinarily called a puppet the only difference is that the puppets wires are thick and visible to ordinary eyes whereas the formerthe rays or filaments that enter into the causation of human socalled actionsare too fine and subtle to be spotted by any but an able freethinker this splendidly accounts for all the operations that we have been taught to ascribe to a source of thought within us thats an ingenious line of thought and must contribute greatly to freeing men from all anxiety about moral notions by tracing their actions not to a source in the human soul but rather to external things but i have some worries about it you suppose the mind to be in a literal sense moved and you take its volitions to be mere motions but suppose someone said and lets face it someone may that the soul is not a body that motion is one thing and volition another id like to know how you would go about convincing such a person your account will be very clear to those who accept that the soul is a body and that all its acts are merely motions given that basis our account of human nature is true fine and new but if someone denies your supposition that the soul is corporeala denial that its very easy to makethen everything you have built on it collapses if we grant that the soul is a body and volitions are motions we are certainly committed then to a fatal necessity ie to the view that all our actions are necessary in the sense that whatever we do we were fated to do bound to do inevitably going to do but i see no reason for granting those two points on the contrary it seems clear that motion and thought are two things as really and as obviously distinct from one another as a triangle is from a sound so it looks as though your argument for the necessity of human actions has a premise that needs to be proved just as badly as the conclusion does well if we suppose that the mind is not corporeal i can still prove my conclusion i shant baffle you with farfetched arguments and merely ask you to look into yourself and observe what happens when some object comes before your mind your understanding considers it then your judgment makes some decree about it as a thing to be chosen or rejected to be done or not done and if done then done thus and not so this decree of the judgment necessarily determines the will whose role is merely to carry out anything ordained by another faculty something necessary cant be free so theres no such thing as freedom of the will freedom is present only when there is an indifference to either side of the question ie when the deliberating mind is evenly poised between the alternatives a power to act or not act without being told what to do or in any way controlled by something external to the will and its obvious that the will cant be free when it doesnt have this indifference and this power and its equally obvious that the will is not indifferent in its actions being absolutely determined and governed by the faculty of judgment my point is not affected by the question of what it is that moves the judgmentwhether its the greatest present uneasiness as locke came to think or the greatest apparent good as many have thought including locke to begin with or something else again whatever it is that moves the judgment the fact remains that the will is always settled and controlled by the judgment and so is always subject to necessity nowhere in the entire human makeup is there anything like a free agent every faculty is determined in all its acts by something external to it the understanding for instance cant alter one of its ideasit necessarily sees each idea in the way that it presents itself the appetites are carried towards their respective objects by a natural necessity reason cant infer anything from anything just as it chooses it is limited by the nature and connection of things and the eternal rules of reasoning which means that it is subject to necessity and the same is true for all our other faculties as well as for the will itself as i have already shown and if we can believe the divine characterizer of our times the will must be agreed to be the most slavish of all our faculties the earl of shaftesbury author of characteristics of etc was widely liked and admired but even alciphron wouldnt call him divine in making him do so berkeley is throwing in a sarcastic jibe of his own some admirers of the present work regret its intemperate hostility to shaftesbury appetite says that noble writer which is reasons older and stronger brother is sure in every contest to be on the winning side as for the will so highly boasted of it is never better than a football for those youngsters to kick or a spinningtop for them to whip to keep it moving the youngsters turn out to be very illmatched and eventually the younger of them instead of now and then getting in a kick or a lash to little purpose leaves the ball or top and starts to kick or lash his older brother crito comments sarcastically on the style and manner of this beautiful parable and asks why the weaker brother would get satisfaction from attacking the stronger one alciphron brushes this off and then the same conclusion can also proved from gods foreknowledge whatever is certainly foreknown will certainly happen what will certainly happen is necessary necessary actions cant be the effect of freewill so now you have this fundamental thesis in our freethinking philosophy demonstrated in two different ways see qa note on page i the proposition that god creates something that is free is not selfcontradictory ii so it is possible that there may be such a thing as a free creature iii this is something that you can conceive and suppose iv such a free creature would think that he acted v and he would condemn himself for some actions and approve of himself for others vi he would think that he deserved reward or punishment vii and all these characteristics are actually found in man tell me now what other qualities does your supposed free agent haveones that are not to be found in man if there arent any we must conclude that man has all the marks of a free agent let me see i was certainly mistaken when i conceded that it was possible at least for almighty power to make such a thing as a free agent i wonder how i came to make such an absurd concession after what had been demonstrated in so many different ways certainly whatever doesnt imply a contradiction is possible for an infinite power and whatever is possible can be supposed therefore if rational agent isnt selfcontradictory then a rational agent can be supposed perhaps from this supposition i might infer that man is free but i wont suppose him to be a free agent since you apparently claim to have demonstrated that he isnt but listen its common knowledge that men base their opinions about others on themselves but when you reach a conclusion about me on the basis of what you know about yourself you may be mistaken many things that are clear to someone with your strength of intellect are not so clear to me who am often puzzled rather than enlightened by those very proofs that you regard as clear and evident i cant be thoroughly convinced by any inference however logically sound it is if its premises arent clear so please let me put questions to you your answers may sort out for me the things that at present i am confused about ill leave with you what i have already said for you to consider and chew over its time now for lysicles and me to set out for london so theres no time for a long questionandanswer session then let me make a couple of brief remarks on what you have said you take that for granted something that i cannot grant when you say that whatever is certain is necessary to me certain and necessary seem to be very different because theres nothing in certain that implies constraint and so theres nothing in it that isnt consistent with a mans being accountable for his actions if it is foreseen that suchandsuch an action will be done cant it also be foreseen that it will be done as an effect of human choice and liberty you delicately abstract and distinguish the actions of the mind judgment and will you use such terms as power faculty act determination indifference freedom necessity and so on as if they stood for distinct abstract ideas and this supposition seems to ensnare the mind into the same perplexities and errors that have been seen to accompany the doctrine of abstraction in every other context its selfevident that there is such a thing as motion and yet some philosophers have tried by refined reasoning to prove there is no such thing walking before them was thought the proper way to confute those ingenious men diogenes is reported to have said à propos of zenos difficulty about how there could be motion i solve it by walking it is equally obvious that man is a free agent and though by abstracted reasonings you might puzzle me and seem to prove that he isnt so long as i am conscious of my own actions this inward evidentness of a plain fact will bear me up against all your reasonings however subtle and refined they may be opposing plain propositions by obscure ones may convince me that your philosophers are clever but it wont convince me that their opinions are true i cant conceive why the acute cratylus shaftesburyin his football metaphor page should allow a power of acting to the appetite and to reason the brothers but not to the will the football if we allow that the mind does contain these three distinct beings i dont see how this could be true of them but i dont find it necessary to abstract and distinguish as many beings in the soul of man as you do which reconciles me to the fact that i cant do so without any such distinction it is evident to metaking myself as a whole not as minutely dissectedthat i am a free agent im not helped to go further by being told that the will is a governed by the judgment or that it is b determined by the object because a in no ordinary everyday case can i separate the decree of my judgment from the command of my will b i know that the sensible object is absolutely inert and so cant determine anything and lastly i am conscious that i am an active being who can and do determine myself i dont know what theoretical results i might get if were to suppose spiritual or mental things to be corporeal or to refine actual and real things into general abstracted notions or by metaphysical skill to split simple and individual things into many parts but if instead of any of that i take things as they are and ask any plain untutored man whether he acts or is free in this or that particular action he immediately says yes and i immediately believe him on the basis of what i find within myself and thus by an induction from particular cases i can draw the general conclusion that man is a free agent even if i cant define or conceive an abstract notion of freedom in general if a man is free he is clearly accountable and if you define and abstract and suppose and infer from your definitions abstractions and suppositions that there cant be any freedom in man and then infer from this that he isnt accountable i shall take the liberty of departing from your metaphysical abstracted sense and appealing to the common sense of mankind if we consider the notions people have of guilt and merit praise and blame accountable and unaccountable well find the question of whether to applaud or censure someone acquit or condemn him always rests on the question did he perform the action in question or what comes to the same thing was he himself when he performed it so it seems that in our ordinary everyday thought and talk a person is regarded as accountable if he is an agent you tell me that man is inactive and that perceptible objects act on him but my own experience assures me of the contrary i know i act and i am accountable for what i do in acting and if this is true then the foundation of religion and morality remains unshaken the only question in this area that religion is concerned with is whether the man is accountable and according to my sense and the worlds common sense he is accountable if he acts and its selfevident that he does act so the grounds and purposes of religion are secured whether or not your philosophic notion of liberty fits mans actions and whether or not his actions are certain or contingent does he deserve the guilt or merit of the action in asking that we arent asking did he do it with a free will or what determined his will when he did it or was it certain or foreknown that he would do it the only question is did he do it wilfully but still the question keeps coming back is man free to answer this oughtnt we first to settle what is meant by the word free we ought in my opinion a man is said to be free insofar as he can do what he wills to do isnt that right it seems so so a man who acts according to his will is to be accounted free i admit that this is right in the vulgar see note on page sense of free but a philosopher goes higher than that and asks whether a man is free to will that is whether he can will as he wills i dont know how philosophical it may be to ask this question but to me it seems very idle the notions of guilt and merit justice and reward are in mens minds in advance of any metaphysical lectures or chapters and according to those accepted natural notions there is no doubt that man is accountable that he acts that he is selfdetermined but a minute philosopher misled by wrong initial suppositions runs together things that are obviously distinct bodyspirit motionvolition certaintynecessity and an abstracter or refiner analyses the simplest instantaneous act of the mind to the point where he thinks he can find within it various faculties and tendencies principles and operations causes and effects note the symmetry identifying things that are really distinct and distinguishing things that are really identical and after he has abstracted supposed and reasoned concerning gratuitous and obscure principles he will conclude that the act in question isnt an act at all and that man is not an agent but a puppet or an organ played on by external objects and his will is a top or a football and this passes for philosophy and freethinking whatever it passes for it doesnt at all seem like a natural or sound way of thinking it seems to me that if we start from things that are particular and concrete and proceed from them to general notions and conclusions well have no trouble in this area but if we start with generalities and lay our foundations in abstract ideas well find ourselves entangled and lost in a labyrinth of our own making i neednt point outbecause anyone can see ithow ridiculous it is to claim to prove that man is not an agent while also pleading for free thought and action thus posing as advocates of necessity and of liberty i have hastily thrown together these hints or remarks about this fundamental thesis in our freethinking philosophy as you call it and about your method of arguing for it which seems to provide a fine specimen of the sophistry of abstract ideas if my brevity has led me to be inappropriately dogmatic you must excuse meyou started it by declining to join me in a leisurely examination of the truth i think we have examined matters sufficiently to everything you have said against human liberty it is a sufficient answer to point out that your arguments are wrong from the outseteither because they suppose the soul to be corporeal or because they rely on abstract ideas supposing the soul to be solid is no better than supposing it to be red or blue supposing the will to consist in motion is no better than supposing the will to be you name it these premises about the soul and the will are to put it mildly neither proved nor probable and i see no obstacle to rejecting everything you infer from them and your arguments also contain other gross mistakes and baseless principles in any human action you distinguish the last decree of the judgment from the act of the will you confuse certainty with necessity you ask in effect the absurd question can a man will as he wills the proposition a man wills as he wills is an identical one ie a necessarily true logical triviality that is obviously the case which means that obviously there must be something wrong with the line of thought that led you to make a question of it you say that the appetites have by natural necessity a tendency towards their respective objects i agree and i add my agreement that appetites are not free but you go further telling us the understanding cant alter an idea that it has nor can it infer indifferently anything from anything just as it chooses what of it if we cant alter the nature of objects does that mean that we cant act at all the two versions of reflect berkeleys viewdefended in other works but mainly not in play in this onethat the objects that we perceive and talk about are ideas and if we arent at liberty to make absurd inferences does it follow that we arent free in any way you take it for granted that the mind is inactive but that its ideas act on it as if the contrary werent evident to everyone who has the common sense to know that when the mind considers its ideas it chooses rejects examines deliberates decreesie it acts on them and they dont act on it summing up because your premises are obscure and false the basic point that you claim to have demonstrated in so many different ways isnt shown to be true or even meaningful and on the other hand we dont have to do much research to be convinced that man acts and that man is accountable for his actions nothing is clearer or more obvious than those two propositions nothing is more universally accepted by men of all sorts learned and unlearned at all times and in all places whatever may be claimed by abstracters refiners and men who are committed to a false hypothesis i think it is obvious to every thinking man of common sense that human minds are so far from being machines or footballs acted on and kicked around by corporeal objects with no inner source of freedom or of action that the only basic true notions we have of freedom agent and action are ones we get by reflecting on ourselves and the operations of our own minds the minute philosophers allow themselves to be taken in by the invalid inferences of three or four eminent bishops of unbelief in recent times i cant think of anything that matches their unique credulity ie any other bigoted superstition whose ringleaders have been able so openly and widely to draw their followers from the plain dictates of nature and common sense the discoverers of truth have always met up with the objection that they are departing from accepted opinions the sneering label unique is a tax on freethinking and as such we most willingly accept it and glory in it a genuine philosopher is never modest in such a way as to prefer authority to reason or an old and common opinion to a true one such false modesty discourages men from treading in untrodden paths and from shining new light and that makes it a greater enemy to freethinking than any other personal quality a judicious person who will follow evidence wherever it leads will also allow authority to have its due weight on disputable points without preferring authority we can accept it as a good backup to reason so your gentlemen of the minute philosophy can save yourself the trouble of announcing all those commonplaces about reason and discoveries and light we arent attached to authority against reason or afraid of untrodden paths that lead to truth and we are ready to follow a new light once we are sure it isnt a willothewisp reason may oblige a man to believe something that he doesnt like but why should a man give up salutary notions in favour of others that are as unreasonable as they are harmful your schemes principles and boasted demonstrations have been proposed and examined at length you have shifted your notions successively retreated from one scheme to another and in the end renounced them all your objections to christianity have been treated in the same manner and with the same outcome if from the things you have held against christianity we set aside everything that comes from the errors and faults of particular persons and difficulties which from the nature of things we arent obliged to explain it is surprising to see how little remainsafter such magnificent threatsthat can amount to a relevant objection against the christian religion what you have produced has been tried by the fair test of reason and even if you hope to get the upper hand through ridicule when you cant get it through reason i predict that in the upshot youll find that you cant destroy all sense of religion how berkeley starts the next sentence make your countrymen ever so vicious ignorant and profane either he meant however vicious ignorant and profane you claim your countrymen to be or he meant however vicious ignorant and profane you cause your countrymen to be men will still be disposed to look up to a supreme being religion right or wrong will survive in some shape or other and there will surely be some worship either of god or the creature that is berkeleys phrasemeaning as for your ridicule well your sect presents us with the spectacle of the most unintelligible men of the age parading themselves as freethinkers men so strong in assertion yet so weak in argument advocates for freedom introducing necessity patriots trampling on the laws of their country claimants to virtue destroying the motives for virtue can anything be more ridiculous than that let any impartial man cast an eye on the opinions of the minute philosophers and then say if anything can be more ridiculous than to believe such things and at the same time laugh at the credulity of others say what you will we have the laughers on our side and as for your reasoning i take that to be another name for sophistry and i suppose by the same rule you take your own sophisms to be arguments let me be frank about this i dont know of any type of sophismany type of logical mistakethat minute philosophers dont use against religion they are guilty of working from false assumptions in taking it for granted that we believe contradictions of bad causal thinking in asserting that uncharitable feuds and discords are the effects of christianity and of pointmissing in demanding that we demonstrate things that we only claim to believe as matters of faith crito gives each of these a technical latin label speaking for myself if sophistry is the art or power of deceiving other men i must acquit these gentlemen of it they seem to have led me on a journey through atheism libertinism fanaticism and fatalism not to convince me of the truth of any of them so much as to confirm me in my own way of thinking they have displayed their flimsy wares not to cheat but to amuse us knowing them to be selfannounced masters of ridicule i dont know what seriously to make of them you dont know what to make of us id be sorry if you did only a superficial philosopher can be quickly fathomed creating ambiguity about where one stands seems to be the sure way to fame and esteem in the learned world as it now is when an able reader cant decide whether his author is atheist or deist or polytheist stoic or epicurean sceptic or dogmatist unbeliever or religious fanatic joking or serious he immediately concludes that the author is enigmatic and deep in fact its true of the most admired writers of our time that noone can tell what to make of them or what they are getting at we have among us moles that dig deep under ground and eagles that soar out of sight we can act all parts and become all opinions putting them on or off with great freedom of wit and humour it seems then that you are a pair of inscrutable unfathomable fashionable philosophers that cant be denied but i remember that you started off with an open dogmatic air talked of plain principles and evident reasoning and promised to make things as clear as noonday to wipe out wrong notions and plant right ones in their place before long though you began to back away from your first notions and adopt others you advanced one while retracting another asserted and conceded said and unsaid and after having followed you through so many untrodden paths and intricate mazes i find myself no nearer to understanding what you actually think didnt we tell you that the gentlemen of our sect are very good at teasing but it seems to me to be useless for a plain man with some settled beliefs or principles to do battle with such slippery dodging changeable philosophers the rule seems to be the christian man must stand still in one place while his freethinking adversary chooses and changes his fightingposition has full range and liberty to move around the battlefield and attack his christian opponent on all sides in all shapes from close up or with missiles from far away on horseback or on foot in light or heavy armour theres no denying that a gentleman has a great advantage over a straitlaced pedant or bigot but at the end of it all how am i better off from the conversation of two such knowledgeable gentlemen i hoped to unlearn my errors and to learn truths from you but i find to my great disappointment that i havent been untaught anything or taught anything its hard to unteach men their prejudices but that has to be done before we can offer to teach them the truth and anyway we dont now have time to prove and argue the ensuing remarks about laws of hospitality confinement in the castle etc are a running joke it looks like a rather thin cover for the anger and contempt that have been building up especially on the christian side well suppose that my mind is white paper and that you are invited to write on it the things that you would teach me if only i were teachable dont try to wipe out my present opinions or to prove your own for once dont joke or tease just let me know some one conclusion of yours before we part if you dont ill beg crito to violate the laws of hospitality towards those who have violated the laws of philosophy by hanging out false lights to someone who isaccording to youbenighted in ignorance and error false lights were lights placed on the seashore in a position that is likely to draw a ship onto the rocks i appeal to you shouldnt these philosophical knighterrants be confined in this castle of yours until they make reparation euphranor is right said crito and my sentence is that you remain here in prison until you have done something towards satisfying my undertaking to euphranor which was that he would know your opinions from yourselves which you also agreed to since it must be so i will now reveal what i take to be the sum and substance the grand arcanum see note on page and final conclusion of our sect i can do it in two words and he utters a twogreekword sentence which means there are only hypotheses so youre a downright sceptic but sceptic as you are you admit that it is probable that there is a god certain that the christian religion is useful possible that it is true certain that if it is true the minute philosophers are in bad shape given all this how can there be any question about what course a wise man should take whether the principles of christians or unbelievers are truest may be made a question but there is no question about which are safest if you have doubts about all opinions you must have doubts about your own which means that for all you know christianity may be true the more doubt the more room there is for faith because a sceptic has less right than anyone else to demand evidence evidentness but whatever uncertainty there may be about some things this much is certain either there is a god or there isnt either there is a revelation or there isnt either man is an agent or he isnt either the soul is immortal or it isnt if the negatives are not sure the affirmatives are possible if the negatives are improbable the affirmatives are probable the more any of your able men finds himself unable to prove any one of these negatives the stronger grounds he has to suspect he may be mistaken so a minute philosopher who wants to act consistently ought to share with the sceptic not merely the sceptics doubts but also his diffidence his modesty and his timidity he shouldnt announce an ocean of light and then lead us to an abyss of darkness if that conduct isnt ridiculous i dont know what ridiculous means as for your ridiculing something that may for all you know be truei cant make any sense of that it isnt acting as a wise man with regard to your own interests or as a good man with regard to the interests of your country cicero says somewhere let us either get rid of religion altogether or retain it altogether if there is a single instance of a people prospering without any religion propose in the british parliament that we change our constitution and live without religion if there is any religion better than christianity propose to the parliament that we introduce that new religion a sceptic is a member of a community just like any other man and he can distinguish good from evil whether natural or political and his knowledge of this distinction should be his guide as a patriot even though he isnt a christian and if he doesnt claim to know even this much he should stop claiming to correct or alter something that he knows nothing about also someone who merely doubts shouldnt behave as if he could demonstrate consider someone who says i find my country in possession of certain tenets namely those of christianity they appear to do good which is why they are encouraged by the legislature they are a main part of our constitution and i dont find that these freethinking innovators can disprove them or substitute things more useful and certain in their place so i shall go along with those tenets out of regard for the good of mankind and for the laws of my country i dont say that this man is a christian but i regard him as a patriot with something that matters as much as christianity does not to inquire is folly but it is even greater folly to condemn without inquiring lysicles seemed heartily tired of this conversation it is now late he said to alciphron and everything is ready for our departure everyone has his own way of thinking and i can no more adopt another mans way of thinking than i can adopt his complexion and facial features alciphron pleaded that they had complied with euphranors conditions for being released from the castle and that they should now be set free and euphranor answered that he had no further claims to makeall he had wanted was to know their tenets epilogue after the philosophers had left i remarked to crito that it was hard to understand how men who are so easy to confute should be so difficult to convince aristotle explains this said crito he says that arguments dont have an effect on everyone but only on those whose minds are prepared by upbringing and habits as land is prepared for seed nichomachean ethics however clear a point is the odds are that it wont be understood by someone whose habits and cast of mind go against it so weak a thing is reason when in competition with inclination i replied that this answer might hold with respect to some people at some times but that it didnt seem satisfactory when applied to inquiring men at a time when reason is so much cultivated and thinking so much in vogue a man who is a keen social observer said crito has said that these days thinking is talked of more than it was in ancient times but practised less and that since the revival of learning men have read much and written much but thought little so that for us thinking closely and soundly is a tiny part of what a learned man does and doesnt figure at all in the activities of the socially polished man the freethinkers it must be admitted parade themselves as thinkers but dont show much exactness in their thinking a lively man and what the world calls a man of sense are often no good at all at thinking the ability to think is not a mere gift of nature but must be improved and perfected by much attention and exercise on very different subjects which means that it requires more time and trouble than todays quickoffthemark men care to takethose are the views of a judicious friend of mine if you arent already sufficiently convinced of their truth you need only look at the dark confused admired writers of this famous sect then youll be able to judge whether those who are led by men whose heads are so wrong can have very good heads of their own take for example spinoza the great leader of our modern unbelievers whose writings contain many schemes and notions that have been much admired and followed in recent years for example undermining religion under the pretence of vindicating and explaining it maintaining that it isnt necessary to believe in christ according to the flesh persuading men that miracles are to be understood only in a spiritual and allegorical sense that vice is not as bad a thing as we are apt to think that men are mere machines impelled by fatal necessity i remarked i have heard spinoza described as a man of close argument and demonstration he did indeed demonstrate replied crito but by his standards anyone could demonstrate anything if a man is allowed the privilege of making his own definitions of common words it will be easy for him to demonstrate conclusions that are true in one sense and false in anothertrue and indeed manifest truisms in his sense but false and indeed seeming paradoxes when the words are taken in their ordinary senses for example let spinoza define natural right to be natural power and he will easily demonstrate that whatever a man can do he has a right to do the folly of this procedure is utterly obvious but our freethinkers who claim to have the lumen siccum are so passionately prejudiced against religion that theyll accept as demonstrations the grossest nonsense and sophistry of weak and wicked writers lumen siccum is latin for dry light it comes from bacons brilliant metaphor the human intellect doesnt burn with a dry light because what the person wants and feels gets pumped into it and these men make so much noise with their thinking reasoning and demonstrating that they prejudice some wellmeaning people against all use and improvement of reason one man saw a neighbour of his ruined by the vices of a freethinking son and acquired such a prejudice against thinking that he wouldnt let his own son read euclid because he had been told that it might teach him to think he was rescued from this by a friend who convinced him that the epidemic was not an outbreak of thinking but merely an unthinking pretence of thinking i know one eminent freethinker who never goes to bed without a gallon of wine in his belly and he always replenishes it before the fumes have left his brain so that he hasnt had one sober thought in the past seven years he adds two more anecdotes reporting disgraceful behaviour by freethinkers then it is strange said crito that such men should parade themselves as freethinkers but its even stranger that other men should be on bad terms with thinking and reasoning because of such pretenders i answered that some good men thought there is an opposition between reason and religion knowledge and faith nature and grace and were led by that to conclude that the way to promote religion is to quench the light of nature and to discourage all rational inquiry i shant comment on the intentions of these men replied crito but surely their notions are very wrong what could dishonour religion more than representing it as an unreasonable unnatural ignorant institution god is the father of all lights natural as well as revealed natural greed is one thing and the natural light is another and you cant argue that because one is bad so is the other similarly you cant argue that because false knowledge is bad that real knowledge is bad also so whatever is said about one of them in the bible is not to be interpreted as having said something about the other i insisted that human learning in the hands of theologians had from time to time created great disputes and divisions in the church just as abstracted metaphysics have always tended to produce disputes among christians as well as other men said crito it should seem that genuine truth and knowledge would calm this mood that makes men sacrifice the undisputed duties of peace and charity to disputable notions after all i said whatever may be said for reason the sceptics and unbelievers of today wont be cured by it i wont dispute that said crito to cure an illness you should consider what produced it if men had reasoned themselves into a wrong opinion one might hope to reason them out of it but thats not how things stand the unbelief of minute philosophers seems to arise from things very different from thought and reason people are often turned into unbelievers by little incidents vanity disgust mood inclination without any help from reason faced with a doctrine whose general tendency one finds disagreeable the mind is prepared to enjoy and improve everything that can possibly be thought to count against it thus someones reason for his unbelief may be the coarse manners of some country curate the polished manners of a great familys chaplain the wit of a minute philosopher a joke a song a tale vice laziness quarrelsomeness and fashion produce minute philosophers and quite a lot of people become minute philosophers through sheer bad temper who can expect such an irrational and capricious thing should yield to reason still it may be worthwhile to argue against such men and expose their fallacies if not for their sake then for the sake of others who might otherwise be swayed by them the most general pretext that looks like a reason is the one that points to the variety of opinions about religion this is a rock for a lazy and superficial mind to sit on and take a rest but a more spirited mind with a sounder way of thinking will stand on it and look around examining and comparing the differing institutions of religion he will want to know of all these which is the most sublime and rational in its doctrines the most venerable in its mysteries most useful in its commands most decent in its worship which creates the noblest hopes and most worthy views he will consider their rise and progress and try to discover which owes least to human arts or arms which flatters the senses and gross inclinations of men which adorns and improves the most excellent part of our nature which has been propagated in the most wonderful manner which has overcome the greatest difficulties or showed the most disinterested not self interested zeal and sincerity in its adherents he will inquire into which squares best with nature and history he will consider which savours of the world and which looks like wisdom from above hell be careful to separate human alloy from anything that is divine and overall he will form his judgment like a reasonable freethinker but instead of taking such a rational course one of those hasty sceptics will conclude straight off that theres no wisdom in politics no honesty in business no knowledge in philosophy no truth in religion and all by the same sort of inference from premises about the numerous examples of folly knavery ignorance and error that are to be met with in the world and because people who know nothing about anything think they are sharpsighted in religion this learned sophism is oftenest levelled against christianity in my opinion if you want to convince an unbeliever who can be brought to reason you should start by clearly convincing him of the existence of a god because it seems to me that a real theist cant be an enemy to the christian religion and that what basically makes someone a minute philosopher is his ignorance or disbelief about gods existence those who are acquainted with the great authors in the minute philosophy presumably dont need to be told this that god exists can be clearly proved and is a proper object of human reason whereas the mysteries of his natureand indeed any other mysteries there are in religioncant possibly be explained and proved by reason it is sufficient if we show that theres nothing absurd or selfcontradictory in our beliefs on those matters and instead of forming hypotheses to explain them use our reason only for answering the objections brought against them but we ought always to distinguish the serious modest honest man of sense who has doubts about religion and behaves like a prudent man in doubt from the minute philosophers those profane and conceited men who insist on trying to convert others to their own doubts when someone of this kind presents himself we should consider what species he belongs to firsthand philosopher secondhand philosopher libertine scorner sceptic each type requires its own special treatment some men are too ignorant to be humble and without humility nothing can be learned but though a man cant be convinced of anything unless he has done some thinking and considering even the most ignorant and thoughtless can sometimes be laughed out of their opinions i once saw a bright woman get the better of two minute philosophers by taking her cue from their predominant claims about themselves to the one who claimed to be the most incredulous man upon earth she remarked that for someone who was credulous enough to trust the most valuable thingshis life and his fortuneto his pharmacist and his lawyer it was absurd to claim to be too incredulous to trust his soul a mere trifle according to him to his parishpriest to the other a nattily dressed dandy who said that he favoured the most unbounded freedom she remarked that he was an absolute slave in matters of dress to him the most important thing in the world while he was earnestly contending for freedom of thinking which was something he never bothered to do there are very few firsthand minute philosophers not enough of them to matter in themselves but their followers who pin their faith on them are numerous and are as confident as they are credulous and they do matter because theres something in the air and manner of these secondhand philosophers that is very apt to disconcert a serious man who believes in argumentits much harder to put up with than the weight of their objections euphranor suggested that it would be greatly to the publics benefit if instead of discouraging freethinking there was erected a dianoetic academy thinktank or seminary for freethinkers provided with quiet rooms and galleries and shady walks and groves where after seven years of silence and meditation a man might become a genuine freethinker and from then on be legally entitled to think what he pleased and have a badge to distinguish him from counterfeits really seriously said crito i think that what the present time needs most is more thinking and that the real cause of whatever is wrong can fairly be attributed to the general neglect of education in those who need it most namely the people of fashion what can be expected when those who have the most influence have the least sense and those who are sure to be followed set the worst example when the young are so uneducated and yet are heard from so much when modesty is regarded as feebleness and a deference to years knowledge religion and laws is regarded as a lack of sense and spirit he evidently means that modesty etc are regarded etc by the young because he goes on such precocious development wouldnt have been valued or encouraged by the wise men of antiquity whose views on this matter are so out of line with the spirit of our times that modern ears im afraid couldnt bear them what im going to say would seem ridiculous to our british youth who are so full of ideas and so boldly in favour of trying out new things and setting their country to rights but i think it will be accepted by men of sense it is this if todays governments would try as an experiment to consider themselves in that old homeric light as pastors of the people whose duty it was to improve their flock they would soon find that this requires a very different kind of upbringing from the modern one and different maxims from those of the minute philosophy if our youth were really accustomed to thought and reflection and an acquaintance with the excellent writers of antiquity wed see the licentious frame of mind commonly called freethinking banished from the presence of gentlemen along with ignorance and bad taste and one reform in how the young are brought up needs special attention as things are men follow vice for the sake of pleasure and fly from virtue because they hate pain so what is needed is for young minds to be formed and accustomed to receive pleasure and pain from proper objects ie to have their inclinations and aversions pointed in the right directions anyone who feels the cursed effects of a wrong upbringingin his mind his health or his fortuneshould ponder this thought there is no better way for you to make amends for what is wrong in yourself than preventing it from being wrong also in your descendants while crito was saying this other guests came in which put an end to our conversation
