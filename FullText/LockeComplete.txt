of the county of wilt and of south wales my lord this treatise which be grow up under your lordships eye and have venture into the world by your order do now by a natural kind of right come to your lordship for that protection which you several years since promise it it be not that i think any name how great soever set at the begin of a book will be able to cover the fault that be to be find in it things in print must stand and fall by their own worth or the readers fancy but there be nothing more to be desire for truth than a fair unprejudiced hear nobody be more likely to procure me that than your lordship who be allow to have get so intimate an acquaintance with her in her more retire recess your lordship be know to have so far advance your speculations in the most abstract and general knowledge of things beyond the ordinary reach or common methods that your allowance and approbation of the design of this treatise will at least preserve it from be condemn without read and will prevail to have those part a little weight which might otherwise perhaps be think to deserve no consideration for be somewhat out of the common road the imputation of novelty be a terrible charge amongst those who judge of mens head as they do of their perukes by the fashion and can allow none to be right but the receive doctrines truth scarce ever yet carry it by vote anywhere at its first appearance new opinions be always suspect and usually oppose without any other reason but because they be not already common but truth like gold be not the less so for be newly bring out of the mine it be trial and examination must give it price and not any antique fashion and though it be not yet current by the public stamp yet it may for all that be as old as nature and be certainly not the less genuine your lordship can give great and convince instance of this whenever you please to oblige the public with some of those large and comprehensive discoveries you have make of truths hitherto unknown unless to some few from whom your lordship have be please not wholly to conceal them this alone be a sufficient reason be there no other why i should dedicate this essay to your lordship and its have some little correspondence with some part of that nobler and vast system of the sciences your lordship have make so new exact and instructive a draught of i think it glory enough if your lordship permit me to boast that here and there i have fall into some thoughts not wholly different from yours if your lordship think fit that by your encouragement this should appear in the world i hope it may be a reason some time or other to lead your lordship further and you will allow me to say that you here give the world an earnest of something that if they can bear with this will be truly worth their expectation this my lord show what a present i here make to your lordship just such as the poor man do to his rich and great neighbour by whom the basket of flower or fruit be not ill take though he have more plenty of his own growth and in much greater perfection worthless things receive a value when they be make the offer of respect esteem and gratitude these you have give me so mighty and peculiar reason to have in the highest degree for your lordship that if they can add a price to what they go along with proportionable to their own greatness i can with confidence brag i here make your lordship the richest present you ever receive this i be sure i be under the greatest obligations to seek all occasion to acknowledge a long train of favour i have receive from your lordship favour though great and important in themselves yet make much more so by the forwardness concern and kindness and other oblige circumstances that never fail to accompany them to all this you be please to add that which give yet more weight and relish to all the rest you vouchsafe to continue me in some degrees of your esteem and allow me a place in your good thoughts i have almost say friendship this my lord your word and action so constantly show on all occasion even to others when i be absent that it be not vanity in me to mention what everybody know but it would be want of good manners not to acknowledge what so many be witness of and every day tell me i be indebted to your lordship for i wish they could as easily assist my gratitude as they convince me of the great and grow engagements it have to your lordship this i be sure i should write of the understand without have any if i be not extremely sensible of them and do not lay hold on this opportunity to testify to the world how much i be oblige to be and how much i be my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant john locke dorset court th of may epistle to the reader i have put into thy hand what have be the diversion of some of my idle and heavy hours if it have the good luck to prove so of any of thine and thou hast but half so much pleasure in read as i have in write it thou wilt as little think thy money as i do my pain ill bestow mistake not this for a commendation of my work nor conclude because i be please with the do of it that therefore i be fondly take with it now it be do he that hawk at lark and sparrows have no less sport though a much less considerable quarry than he that fly at nobler game and he be little acquaint with the subject of this treatise the understandingwho do not know that as it be the most elevate faculty of the soul so it be employ with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other its search after truth be a sort of hawk and hunt wherein the very pursuit make a great part of the pleasure every step the mind take in its progress towards knowledge make some discovery which be not only new but the best too for the time at least for the understand like the eye judge of object only by its own sight can not but be please with what it discover have less regret for what have escape it because it be unknown thus he who have raise himself above the almsbasket and not content to live lazily on scrap of beg opinions set his own thoughts on work to find and follow truth will whatever he light on not miss the hunters satisfaction every moment of his pursuit will reward his pain with some delight and he will have reason to think his time not ill spend even when he can not much boast of any great acquisition this reader be the entertainment of those who let loose their own thoughts and follow them in write which thou oughtest not to envy them since they afford thee an opportunity of the like diversion if thou wilt make use of thy own thoughts in read it be to them if they be thy own that i refer myself but if they be take upon trust from others it be no great matter what they be they be not follow truth but some meaner consideration and it be not worth while to be concern what he say or think who say or think only as he be direct by another if thou judgest for thyself i know thou wilt judge candidly and then i shall not be harm or offend whatever be thy censure for though it be certain that there be nothing in this treatise of the truth whereof i be not fully persuade yet i consider myself as liable to mistake as i can think thee and know that this book must stand or fall with thee not by any opinion i have of it but thy own if thou findest little in it new or instructive to thee thou art not to blame me for it it be not mean for those that have already master this subject and make a thorough acquaintance with their own understand but for my own information and the satisfaction of a few friends who acknowledge themselves not to have sufficiently consider it be it fit to trouble thee with the history of this essay i should tell thee that five or six friends meet at my chamber and discourse on a subject very remote from this find themselves quickly at a stand by the difficulties that rise on every side after we have awhile puzzle ourselves without come any nearer a resolution of those doubt which perplex us it come into my thoughts that we take a wrong course and that before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature it be necessary to examine our own abilities and see what object our understand be or be not fit to deal with this i propose to the company who all readily assent and thereupon it be agree that this should be our first inquiry some hasty and undigested thoughts on a subject i have never before consider which i set down against our next meet give the first entrance into this discourse which have be thus begin by chance be continue by intreaty write by incoherent parcel and after long intervals of neglect resume again as my humour or occasion permit and at last in a retirement where an attendance on my health give me leisure it be bring into that order thou now seest it this discontinue way of write may have occasion besides others two contrary fault viz that too little and too much may be say in it if thou findest anything want i shall be glad that what i have write give thee any desire that i should have go further if it seem too much to thee thou must blame the subject for when i put pen to paper i think all i should have to say on this matter would have be contain in one sheet of paper but the further i go the larger prospect i have new discoveries lead me still on and so it grow insensibly to the bulk it now appear in i will not deny but possibly it might be reduce to a narrower compass than it be and that some part of it might be contract the way it have be writ in by catch and many long intervals of interruption be apt to cause some repetitions but to confess the truth i be now too lazy or too busy to make it shorter i be not ignorant how little i herein consult my own reputation when i knowingly let it go with a fault so apt to disgust the most judicious who be always the nicest readers but they who know sloth be apt to content itself with any excuse will pardon me if mine have prevail on me where i think i have a very good one i will not therefore allege in my defence that the same notion have different respect may be convenient or necessary to prove or illustrate several part of the same discourse and that so it have happen in many part of this but waive that i shall frankly avow that i have sometimes dwell long upon the same argument and express it different ways with a quite different design i pretend not to publish this essay for the information of men of large thoughts and quick apprehensions to such master of knowledge i profess myself a scholar and therefore warn them beforehand not to expect anything here but what be spin out of my own coarse thoughts be fit to men of my own size to whom perhaps it will not be unacceptable that i have take some pain to make plain and familiar to their thoughts some truths which establish prejudice or the abstractedness of the ideas themselves might render difficult some object have need be turn on every side and when the notion be new as i confess some of these be to me or out of the ordinary road as i suspect they will appear to others it be not one simple view of it that will gain it admittance into every understand or fix it there with a clear and last impression there be few i believe who have not observe in themselves or others that what in one way of propose be very obscure another way of express it have make very clear and intelligible though afterwards the mind find little difference in the phrase and wonder why one fail to be understand more than the other but everything do not hit alike upon every man imagination we have our understand no less different than our palates and he that think the same truth shall be equally relish by every one in the same dress may as well hope to feast every one with the same sort of cookery the meat may be the same and the nourishment good yet every one not be able to receive it with that season and it must be dress another way if you will have it go down with some even of strong constitutions the truth be those who advise me to publish it advise me for this reason to publish it as it be and since i have be bring to let it go abroad i desire it should be understand by whoever give himself the pain to read it i have so little affection to be in print that if i be not flatter this essay might be of some use to others as i think it have be to me i should have confine it to the view of some friends who give the first occasion to it my appear therefore in print be on purpose to be as useful as i may i think it necessary to make what i have to say as easy and intelligible to all sort of readers as i can and i have much rather the speculative and quicksighted should complain of my be in some part tedious than that any one not accustom to abstract speculations or prepossess with different notions should mistake or not comprehend my mean it will possibly be censure as a great piece of vanity or insolence in me to pretend to instruct this our know age it amount to little less when i own that i publish this essay with hop it may be useful to others but if it may be permit to speak freely of those who with a feign modesty condemn as useless what they themselves write methinks it savour much more of vanity or insolence to publish a book for any other end and he fail very much of that respect he owe the public who print and consequently expect men should read that wherein he intend not they should meet with anything of use to themselves or others and should nothing else be find allowable in this treatise yet my design will not cease to be so and the goodness of my intention ought to be some excuse for the worthlessness of my present it be that chiefly which secure me from the fear of censure which i expect not to escape more than better writers mens principles notions and relish be so different that it be hard to find a book which please or displease all men i acknowledge the age we live in be not the least know and therefore not the most easy to be satisfy if i have not the good luck to please yet nobody ought to be offend with me i plainly tell all my readers except half a dozen this treatise be not at first intend for them and therefore they need not be at the trouble to be of that number but yet if any one think fit to be angry and rail at it he may do it securely for i shall find some better way of spend my time than in such kind of conversation i shall always have the satisfaction to have aim sincerely at truth and usefulness though in one of the meanest ways the commonwealth of learn be not at this time without masterbuilders whose mighty design in advance the sciences will leave last monuments to the admiration of posterity but every one must not hope to be a boyle or a sydenham and in an age that produce such master as the great huygenius and the incomparable mr newton with some others of that strain it be ambition enough to be employ as an underlabourer in clear the grind a little and remove some of the rubbish that lie in the way to knowledgewhich certainly have be very much more advance in the world if the endeavour of ingenious and industrious men have not be much cumber with the learn but frivolous use of uncouth affect or unintelligible term introduce into the sciences and there make an art of to that degree that philosophy which be nothing but the true knowledge of things be think unfit or incapable to be bring into wellbred company and polite conversation vague and insignificant form of speech and abuse of language have so long pass for mysteries of science and hard and misapply word with little or no mean have by prescription such a right to be mistake for deep learn and height of speculation that it will not be easy to persuade either those who speak or those who hear them that they be but the cover of ignorance and hindrance of true knowledge to break in upon the sanctuary of vanity and ignorance will be i suppose some service to human understand though so few be apt to think they deceive or be deceive in the use of word or that the language of the sect they be of have any fault in it which ought to be examine or correct that i hope i shall be pardon if i have in the third book dwell long on this subject and endeavour to make it so plain that neither the inveterateness of the mischief nor the prevalency of the fashion shall be any excuse for those who will not take care about the mean of their own word and will not suffer the significancy of their expressions to be inquire into i have be tell that a short epitome of this treatise which be print in be by some condemn without read because innate ideas be deny in it they too hastily conclude that if innate ideas be not suppose there would be little leave either of the notion or proof of spirit if any one take the like offence at the entrance of this treatise i shall desire him to read it through and then i hope he will be convince that the take away false foundations be not to the prejudice but advantage of truth which be never injure or endanger so much as when mix with or build on falsehood in the second edition i add as followeth the bookseller will not forgive me if i say nothing of this new edition which he have promise by the correctness of it shall make amend for the many fault commit in the former he desire too that it should be know that it have one whole new chapter concern identity and many additions and amendments in other place these i must inform my reader be not all new matter but most of them either further confirmation of what i have say or explications to prevent others be mistake in the sense of what be formerly print and not any variation in me from it i must only except the alterations i have make in book ii chap xxi what i have there write concern liberty and the will i think deserve as accurate a view as i be capable of those subject have in all age exercise the learn part of the world with question and difficulties that have not a little perplex morality and divinity those part of knowledge that men be most concern to be clear in upon a closer inspection into the work of mens mind and a stricter examination of those motives and view they be turn by i have find reason somewhat to alter the thoughts i formerly have concern that which give the last determination to the will in all voluntary action this i can not forbear to acknowledge to the world with as much freedom and readiness as i at first publish what then seem to me to be right think myself more concern to quit and renounce any opinion of my own than oppose that of another when truth appear against it for it be truth alone i seek and that will always be welcome to me when or from whencesoever it come but what forwardness soever i have to resign any opinion i have or to recede from anything i have writ upon the first evidence of any error in it yet this i must own that i have not have the good luck to receive any light from those exceptions i have meet with in print against any part of my book nor have from anything that have be urge against it find reason to alter my sense in any of the point that have be question whether the subject i have in hand require often more think and attention than cursory readers at least such as be prepossess be will to allow or whether any obscurity in my expressions cast a cloud over it and these notions be make difficult to others apprehensions in my way of treat them so it be that my mean i find be often mistake and i have not the good luck to be everywhere rightly understand of this the ingenious author of the discourse concern the nature of man have give me a late instance to mention no other for the civility of his expressions and the candour that belong to his order forbid me to think that he would have close his preface with an insinuation as if in what i have say book ii ch xxvii concern the third rule which men refer their action to i go about to make virtue vice and vice virtue unless he have mistake my mean which he could not have do if he have give himself the trouble to consider what the argument be i be then upon and what be the chief design of that chapter plainly enough set down in the fourth section and those follow for i be there not lay down moral rule but show the original and nature of moral ideas and enumerate the rule men make use of in moral relations whether these rule be true or false and pursuant thereto i tell what be everywhere call virtue and vice which alter not the nature of things though men generally do judge of and denominate their action accord to the esteem and fashion of the place and sect they be of if he have be at the pain to reflect on what i have say bk i ch ii sect and bk ii ch xxviii sects and he would have know what i think of the eternal and unalterable nature of right and wrong and what i call virtue and vice and if he have observe that in the place he quote i only report as a matter of fact what others call virtue and vice he would not have find it liable to any great exception for i think i be not much out in say that one of the rule make use of in the world for a grind or measure of a moral relation isthat esteem and reputation which several sort of action find variously in the several societies of men accord to which they be there call virtues or vices and whatever authority the learn mr lowde place in his old english dictionary i daresay it nowhere tell him if i should appeal to it that the same action be not in credit call and count a virtue in one place which be in disrepute pass for and under the name of vice in another the take notice that men bestow the name of virtue and vice accord to this rule of reputation be all i have do or can be lay to my charge to have do towards the make vice virtue or virtue vice but the good man do well and as become his call to be watchful in such point and to take the alarm even at expressions which stand alone by themselves might sound ill and be suspect tis to this zeal allowable in his function that i forgive his cite as he do these word of mine ch xxviii sect ii even the exhortations of inspire teachers have not fear to appeal to common repute philip iv without take notice of those immediately precede which introduce them and run thus whereby even in the corruption of manners the true boundaries of the law of nature which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice be pretty well preserve so that even the exhortations of inspire teachers c by which word and the rest of that section it be plain that i bring that passage of st paul not to prove that the general measure of what men call virtue and vice throughout the world be the reputation and fashion of each particular society within itself but to show that though it be so yet for reason i there give men in that way of denominate their action do not for the most part much stray from the law of nature which be that stand and unalterable rule by which they ought to judge of the moral rectitude and gravity of their action and accordingly denominate them virtues or vices have mr lowde consider this he would have find it little to his purpose to have quote this passage in a sense i use it not and would i imagine have spar the application he subjoin to it as not very necessary but i hope this second edition will give him satisfaction on the point and that this matter be now so express as to show him there be no cause for scruple though i be force to differ from him in these apprehensions he have express in the latter end of his preface concern what i have say about virtue and vice yet we be better agree than he think in what he say in his third chapter p concern natural inscription and innate notions i shall not deny him the privilege he claim p to state the question as he please especially when he state it so as to leave nothing in it contrary to what i have say for accord to him innate notions be conditional things depend upon the concurrence of several other circumstances in order to the souls exert them all that he say for innate imprint impress notions for of innate ideas he say nothing at all amount at last only to thisthat there be certain proposition which though the soul from the begin or when a man be bear do not know yet by assistance from the outward sense and the help of some previous cultivation it may afterwards come certainly to know the truth of which be no more than what i have affirm in my first book for i suppose by the souls exert them he mean its begin to know them or else the souls exert of notions will be to me a very unintelligible expression and i think at best be a very unfit one in this it mislead mens thoughts by an insinuation as if these notions be in the mind before the soul exert them ie before they be knownwhereas truly before they be know there be nothing of them in the mind but a capacity to know them when the concurrence of those circumstances which this ingenious author think necessary in order to the souls exert them bring them into our knowledge p i find him express it thus these natural notions be not so imprint upon the soul as that they naturally and necessarily exert themselves even in children and idiots without any assistance from the outward sense or without the help of some previous cultivation here he say they exert themselves as p that the soul exert them when he have explain to himself or others what he mean by the souls exert innate notions or their exert themselves and what that previous cultivation and circumstances in order to their be exert arehe will i suppose find there be so little of controversy between him and me on the point bat that he call that exert of notions which i in a more vulgar style call know that i have reason to think he bring in my name on this occasion only out of the pleasure he have to speak civilly of me which i must gratefully acknowledge he have do everywhere he mention me not without confer on me as some others have do a title i have no right to there be so many instance of this that i think it justice to my reader and myself to conclude that either my book be plainly enough write to be rightly understand by those who peruse it with that attention and indifferency which every one who will give himself the pain to read ought to employ in read or else that i have write mine so obscurely that it be in vain to go about to mend it whichever of these be the truth it be myself only be affect thereby and therefore i shall be far from trouble my reader with what i think might be say in answer to those several objections i have meet with to passages here and there of my book since i persuade myself that he who think them of moment enough to be concern whether they be true or false will be able to see that what be say be either not well found or else not contrary to my doctrine when i and my opposer come both to be well understand if any other author careful that none of their good thoughts should be lose have publish their censure of my essay with this honour do to it that they will not suffer it to be an essay i leave it to the public to value the obligation they have to their critical pen and shall not waste my readers time in so idle or illnatured an employment of mine as to lessen the satisfaction any one have in himself or give to others in so hasty a confutation of what i have write the booksellers prepare for the fourth edition of my essay give me notice of it that i might if i have leisure make any additions or alterations i should think fit whereupon i think it convenient to advertise the reader that besides several corrections i have make here and there there be one alteration which it be necessary to mention because it run through the whole book and be of consequence to be rightly understand what i thereupon say be this clear and distinct ideas be term which though familiar and frequent in mens mouth i have reason to think every one who use do not perfectly understand and possibly tis but here and there one who give himself the trouble to consider them so far as to know what he himself or others precisely mean by them i have therefore in most place choose to put determinate or determine instead of clear and distinct as more likely to direct mens thoughts to my mean in this matter by those denominations i mean some object in the mind and consequently determine ie such as it be there see and perceive to be this i think may fitly be call a determinate or determine idea when such as it be at any time objectively in the mind and so determine there it be annex and without variation determine to a name or articulate sound which be to be steadily the sign of that very same object of the mind or determinate idea to explain this a little more particularly by determinate when apply to a simple idea i mean that simple appearance which the mind have in its view or perceive in itself when that idea be say to be in it by determine when apply to a complex idea i mean such an one as consist of a determinate number of certain simple or less complex ideas join in such a proportion and situation as the mind have before its view and see in itself when that idea be present in it or should be present in it when a man give a name to it i say should be because it be not every one nor perhaps any one who be so careful of his language as to use no word till he view in his mind the precise determine idea which he resolve to make it the sign of the want of this be the cause of no small obscurity and confusion in mens thoughts and discourse i know there be not word enough in any language to answer all the variety of ideas that enter into mens discourse and reason but this hinder not but that when any one use any term he may have in his mind a determine idea which he make it the sign of and to which he should keep it steadily annex during that present discourse where he do not or can not do this he in vain pretend to clear or distinct ideas it be plain his be not so and therefore there can be expect nothing but obscurity and confusion where such term be make use of which have not such a precise determination upon this grind i have think determine ideas a way of speak less liable to mistake than clear and distinct and where men have get such determine ideas of all that they reason inquire or argue about they will find a great part of their doubt and dispute at an end the greatest part of the question and controversies that perplex mankind depend on the doubtful and uncertain use of word or which be the same indetermined ideas which they be make to stand for i have make choice of these term to signify some immediate object of the mind which it perceive and have before it distinct from the sound it use as a sign of it that this idea thus determine ie which the mind have in itself and know and see there be determine without any change to that name and that name determine to that precise idea if men have such determine ideas in their inquiries and discourse they would both discern how far their own inquiries and discourse go and avoid the greatest part of the dispute and wrangle they have with others besides this the bookseller will think it necessary i should advertise the reader that there be an addition of two chapters wholly new the one of the association of ideas the other of enthusiasm these with some other larger additions never before print he have engage to print by themselves after the same manner and for the same purpose as be do when this essay have the second impression in the sixth edition there be very little add or alter the greatest part of what be new be contain in the twentyfirst chapter of the second book which any one if he think it worth while may with a very little labour transcribe into the margin of the former edition an essay concern human understand as thou knowest not what be the way of the spirit nor how the bone do grow in the womb of her that be with child even so thou knowest not the work of god who maketh all thingseccles quam bellum est velle confiteri potius nescire quod nescias quam ista effutientem nauseare atque ipsum sibi displicerecicero de natur deor l i an inquiry into the understand pleasant and useful since it be the understand that set man above the rest of sensible be and give him all the advantage and dominion which he have over them it be certainly a subject even for its nobleness worth our labour to inquire into the understand like the eye whilst it make us see and perceive all other things take no notice of itself and it require art and pain to set it at a distance and make it its own object but whatever be the difficulties that lie in the way of this inquiry whatever it be that keep us so much in the dark to ourselves sure i be that all the light we can let in upon our mind all the acquaintance we can make with our own understand will not only be very pleasant but bring us great advantage in direct our thoughts in the search of other things design this therefore be my purposeto inquire into the original certainty and extent of human knowledge together with the ground and degrees of belief opinion and assenti shall not at present meddle with the physical consideration of the mind or trouble myself to examine wherein its essence consist or by what motion of our spirit or alterations of our body we come to have any sensation by our organs or any ideas in our understand and whether those ideas do in their formation any or all of them depend on matter or not these be speculations which however curious and entertain i shall decline as lie out of my way in the design i be now upon it shall suffice to my present purpose to consider the discern faculties of a man as they be employ about the object which they have to do with and i shall imagine i have not wholly misemployed myself in the thoughts i shall have on this occasion if in this historical plain method i can give any account of the ways whereby our understand come to attain those notions of things we have and can set down any measure of the certainty of our knowledge or the ground of those persuasions which be to be find amongst men so various different and wholly contradictory and yet assert somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence that he that shall take a view of the opinions of mankind observe their opposition and at the same time consider the fondness and devotion wherewith they be embrace the resolution and eagerness wherewith they be maintain may perhaps have reason to suspect that either there be no such thing as truth at all or that mankind hath no sufficient mean to attain a certain knowledge of it method it be therefore worth while to search out the bound between opinion and knowledge and examine by what measure in things whereof we have no certain knowledge we ought to regulate our assent and moderate our persuasion in order whereunto i shall pursue this follow method first i shall inquire into the original of those ideas notions or whatever else you please to call them which a man observe and be conscious to himself he have in his mind and the ways whereby the understand come to be furnish with them secondly i shall endeavour to show what knowledge the understand hath by those ideas and the certainty evidence and extent of it thirdly i shall make some inquiry into the nature and ground of faith or opinion whereby i mean that assent which we give to any proposition as true of whose truth yet we have no certain knowledge and here we shall have occasion to examine the reason and degrees of assent useful to know the extent of our comprehension if by this inquiry into the nature of the understand i can discover the power thereof how far they reach to what things they be in any degree proportionate and where they fail us i suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more cautious in meddle with things exceed its comprehension to stop when it be at the utmost extent of its tether and to sit down in a quiet ignorance of those things which upon examination be find to be beyond the reach of our capacities we should not then perhaps be so forward out of an affectation of an universal knowledge to raise question and perplex ourselves and others with dispute about things to which our understand be not suit and of which we can not frame in our mind any clear or distinct perceptions or whereof as it have perhaps too often happen we have not any notions at all if we can find out how far the understand can extend its view how far it have faculties to attain certainty and in what case it can only judge and guess we may learn to content ourselves with what be attainable by us in this state our capacity suit to our state and concern for though the comprehension of our understand come exceed short of the vast extent of things yet we shall have cause enough to magnify the bountiful author of our be for that proportion and degree of knowledge he have bestow on us so far above all the rest of the inhabitants of this our mansion men have reason to be well satisfy with what god hath think fit for them since he hath give them as st

enough to lead them to the knowledge of their maker and the sight of their own duties men may find matter sufficient to busy their head and employ their hand with variety delight and satisfaction if they will not boldly quarrel with their own constitution and throw away the bless their hand be fill with because they be not big enough to grasp everything we shall not have much reason to complain of the narrowness of our mind if we will but employ them about what may be of use to us for of that they be very capable and it will be an unpardonable as well as childish peevishness if we undervalue the advantage of our knowledge and neglect to improve it to the end for which it be give us because there be some things that be set out of the reach of it it will be no excuse to an idle and untoward servant who would not attend his business by candle light to plead that he have not broad sunshine the candle that be set up in us shin bright enough for all our purpose the discoveries we can make with this ought to satisfy us and we shall then use our understand right when we entertain all object in that way and proportion that they be suit to our faculties and upon those ground they be capable of be propose to us and not peremptorily or intemperately require demonstration and demand certainty where probability only be to be have and which be sufficient to govern all our concernments if we will disbelieve everything because we can not certainly know all things we shall do muchwhat as wisely as he who would not use his legs but sit still and perish because he have no wing to fly knowledge of our capacity a cure of scepticism and idleness when we know our own strength we shall the better know what to undertake with hop of success and when we have well survey the power of our own mind and make some estimate what we may expect from them we shall not be incline either to sit still and not set our thoughts on work at all in despair of know anything nor on the other side question everything and disclaim all knowledge because some things be not to be understand it be of great use to the sailor to know the length of his line though he can not with it fathom all the depths of the ocean it be well he know that it be long enough to reach the bottom at such place as be necessary to direct his voyage and caution him against run upon shoal that may ruin him our business here be not to know all things but those which concern our conduct if we can find out those measure whereby a rational creature put in that state in which man be in this world may and ought to govern his opinions and action depend thereon we need not to be trouble that some other things escape our knowledge occasion of this essay this be that which give the first rise to this essay concern the understand for i think that the first step towards satisfy several inquiries the mind of man be very apt to run into be to take a survey of our own understand examine our own power and see to what things they be adapt till that be do i suspect we begin at the wrong end and in vain seek for satisfaction in a quiet and sure possession of truths that most concern us whilst we let loose our thoughts into the vast ocean of be as if all that boundless extent be the natural and undoubted possession of our understand wherein there be nothing exempt from its decisions or that escape its comprehension thus men extend their inquiries beyond their capacities and let their thoughts wander into those depths where they can find no sure foot it be no wonder that they raise question and multiply dispute which never come to any clear resolution be proper only to continue and increase their doubt and to confirm them at last in perfect scepticism whereas be the capacities of our understand well consider the extent of our knowledge once discover and the horizon find which set the bound between the enlighten and dark part of things between what be and what be not comprehensible by us men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avow ignorance of the one and employ their thoughts and discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the other what idea stand for thus much i think necessary to say concern the occasion of this inquiry into human understand but before i proceed on to what i have think on this subject i must here in the entrance beg pardon of my reader for the frequent use of the word idea which he will find in the follow treatise it be that term which i think serve best to stand for whatsoever be the object of the understand when a man think i have use it to express whatever be mean by phantasm notion species or whatever it be which the mind can be employ about in think and i could not avoid frequently use it i presume it will be easily grant me that there be such ideas in mens mind every one be conscious of them in himself and mens word and action will satisfy him that they be in others our first inquiry then shall behow they come into the mind neither principles nor ideas be innate no innate speculative principles the way show how we come by any knowledge sufficient to prove it not innate it be an establish opinion amongst some men that there be in the understand certain innate principles some primary notions koinai ennoiai character as it be stamp upon the mind of man which the soul receive in its very first be and bring into the world with it it would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced readers of the falseness of this supposition if i should only show as i hope i shall in the follow part of this discourse how men barely by the use of their natural faculties may attain to all the knowledge they have without the help of any innate impressions and may arrive at certainty without any such original notions or principles for i imagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to suppose the ideas of colour innate in a creature to whom god hath give sight and a power to receive them by the eye from external object and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truths to the impressions of nature and innate character when we may observe in ourselves faculties fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of them as if they be originally imprint on the mind but because a man be not permit without censure to follow his own thoughts in the search of truth when they lead him ever so little out of the common road i shall set down the reason that make me doubt of the truth of that opinion as an excuse for my mistake if i be in one which i leave to be consider by those who with me dispose themselves to embrace truth wherever they find it general assent the great argument there be nothing more commonly take for grant than that there be certain principles both speculative and practical for they speak of both universally agree upon by all mankind which therefore they argue must need be the constant impressions which the souls of men receive in their first be and which they bring into the world with them as necessarily and really as they do any of their inherent faculties universal consent prove nothing innate this argument draw from universal consent have this misfortune in it that if it be true in matter of fact that there be certain truths wherein all mankind agree it would not prove them innate if there can be any other way show how men may come to that universal agreement in the things they do consent in which i presume may be do what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be not universally assent to but which be worse this argument of universal consent which be make use of to prove innate principles seem to me a demonstration that there be none such because there be none to which all mankind give an universal assent i shall begin with the speculative and instance in those magnify principles of demonstration whatsoever be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be which of all others i think have the most allow title to innate these have so settle a reputation of maxims universally receive that it will no doubt be think strange if any one should seem to question it but yet i take liberty to say that these proposition be so far from have an universal assent that there be a great part of mankind to whom they be not so much as know not on the mind naturally imprint because not know to children idiots c for first it be evident that all children and idiots have not the least apprehension or think of them and the want of that be enough to destroy that universal assent which must need be the necessary concomitant of all innate truths it seem to me near a contradiction to say that there be truths imprint on the soul which it perceive or understand not imprint if it signify anything be nothing else but the make certain truths to be perceive for to imprint anything on the mind without the mind perceive it seem to me hardly intelligible if therefore children and idiots have souls have mind with those impressions upon them they must unavoidably perceive them and necessarily know and assent to these truths which since they do not it be evident that there be no such impressions for if they be not notions naturally imprint how can they be innate and if they be notions imprint how can they be unknown to say a notion be imprint on the mind and yet at the same time to say that the mind be ignorant of it and never yet take notice of it be to make this impression nothing no proposition can be say to be in the mind which it never yet know which it be never yet conscious of for if any one may then by the same reason all proposition that be true and the mind be capable ever of assent to may be say to be in the mind and to be imprint since if any one can be say to be in the mind which it never yet know it must be only because it be capable of know it and so the mind be of all truths it ever shall know nay thus truths may be imprint on the mind which it never do nor ever shall know for a man may live long and die at last in ignorance of many truths which his mind be capable of know and that with certainty so that if the capacity of know be the natural impression contend for all the truths a man ever come to know will by this account be every one of them innate and this great point will amount to no more but only to a very improper way of speak which whilst it pretend to assert the contrary say nothing different from those who deny innate principles for nobody i think ever deny that the mind be capable of know several truths the capacity they say be innate the knowledge acquire but then to what end such contest for certain innate maxims if truths can be imprint on the understand without be perceive i can see no difference there can be between any truths the mind be capable of know in respect of their original they must all be innate or all adventitious in vain shall a man go about to distinguish them he therefore that talk of innate notions in the understand can not if he intend thereby any distinct sort of truths mean such truths to be in the understand as it never perceive and be yet wholly ignorant of for if these word to be in the understand have any propriety they signify to be understand so that to be in the understand and not to be understand to be in the mind and never to be perceive be all one as to say anything be and be not in the mind or understand if therefore these two proposition whatsoever be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be by nature imprint children can not be ignorant of them infants and all that have souls must necessarily have them in their understand know the truth of them and assent to it that men know them when they come to the use of reason answer to avoid this it be usually answer that all men know and assent to them when they come to the use of reason and this be enough to prove them innate i answer doubtful expressions that have scarce any signification go for clear reason to those who be prepossess take not the pain to examine even what they themselves say for to apply this answer with any tolerable sense to our present purpose it must signify one of these two things either that as soon as men come to the use of reason these suppose native inscriptions come to be know and observe by them or else that the use and exercise of mens reason assist them in the discovery of these principles and certainly make them know to them if reason discover them that would not prove them innate if they mean that by the use of reason men may discover these principles and that this be sufficient to prove them innate their way of argue will stand thus viz that whatever truths reason can certainly discover to us and make us firmly assent to those be all naturally imprint on the mind since that universal assent which be make the mark of them amount to no more but thisthat by the use of reason we be capable to come to a certain knowledge of and assent to them and by this mean there will be no difference between the maxims of the mathematicians and theorems they deduce from them all must be equally allow innate they be all discoveries make by the use of reason and truths that a rational creature may certainty come to know if he apply his thoughts rightly that way it be false that reason discover them but how can these men think the use of reason necessary to discover principles that be suppose innate when reason if we may believe them be nothing else but the faculty of deduce unknown truths from principles or proposition that be already know that certainly can never be think innate which we have need of reason to discover unless as i have say we will have all the certain truths that reason ever teach us to be innate we may as well think the use of reason necessary to make our eye discover visible object as that there should be need of reason or the exercise thereof to make the understand see what be originally engraven on it and can not be in the understand before it be perceive by it so that to make reason discover those truths thus imprint be to say that the use of reason discover to a man what he know before and if men have those innate impress truths originally and before the use of reason and yet be always ignorant of them till they come to the use of reason it be in effect to say that men know and know them not at the same time no use make of reason in the discovery of these two maxims it will here perhaps be say that mathematical demonstrations and other truths that be not innate be not assent to as soon as propose wherein they be distinguish from these maxims and other innate truths i shall have occasion to speak of assent upon the first propose more particularly by and by i shall here only and that very readily allow that these maxims and mathematical demonstrations be in this different that the one have need of reason use of proof to make them out and to gain our assent but the other as soon as understand be without any the least reason embrace and assent to but i withal beg leave to observe that it lay open the weakness of this subterfuge which require the use of reason for the discovery of these general truths since it must be confess that in their discovery there be no use make of reason at all and i think those who give this answer will not be forward to affirm that the knowledge of this maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be a deduction of our reason for this would be to destroy that bounty of nature they seem so fond of whilst they make the knowledge of those principles to depend on the labour of our thoughts for all reason be search and cast about and require pain and application and how can it with any tolerable sense be suppose that what be imprint by nature as the foundation and guide of our reason should need the use of reason to discover it and if there be this would prove them not innate those who will take the pain to reflect with a little attention on the operations of the understand will find that this ready assent of the mind to some truths depend not either on native inscription or the use of reason but on a faculty of the mind quite distinct from both of them as we shall see hereafter reason therefore have nothing to do in procure our assent to these maxims if by say that men know and assent to them when they come to the use of reason be mean that the use of reason assist us in the knowledge of these maxims it be utterly false and be it true would prove them not to be innate the come to the use of reason not the time we come to know these maxims if by know and assent to them when we come to the use of reason be mean that this be the time when they come to be take notice of by the mind and that as soon as children come to the use of reason they come also to know and assent to these maxims this also be false and frivolous first it be false because it be evident these maxims be not in the mind so early as the use of reason and therefore the come to the use of reason be falsely assign as the time of their discovery how many instance of the use of reason may we observe in children a long time before they have any knowledge of this maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and a great part of illiterate people and savage pass many years even of their rational age without ever think on this and the like general proposition i grant men come not to the knowledge of these general and more abstract truths which be think innate till they come to the use of reason and i add nor then neither which be so because till after they come to the use of reason those general abstract ideas be not frame in the mind about which those general maxims be which be mistake for innate principles but be indeed discoveries make and verities introduce and bring into the mind by the same way and discover by the same step as several other proposition which nobody be ever so extravagant as to suppose innate this i hope to make plain in the sequel of this discourse i allow therefore a necessity that men should come to the use of reason before they get the knowledge of those general truths but deny that mens come to the use of reason be the time of their discovery by this they be not distinguish from other knowable truths in the mean time it be observable that this say that men know and assent to these maxims when they come to the use of reason amount in reality of fact to no more but thisthat they be never know nor take notice of before the use of reason but may possibly be assent to some time after during a man life but when be uncertain and so may all other knowable truths as well as these which therefore have no advantage nor distinction from others by this note of be know when we come to the use of reason nor be thereby prove to be innate but quite the contrary if come to the use of reason be the time of their discovery it would not prove them innate but secondly be it true that the precise time of their be know and assent to be when men come to the use of reason neither would that prove them innate this way of argue be as frivolous as the supposition itself be false for by what kind of logic will it appear that any notion be originally by nature imprint in the mind in its first constitution because it come first to be observe and assent to when a faculty of the mind which have quite a distinct province begin to exert itself and therefore the come to the use of speech if it be suppose the time that these maxims be first assent to which it may be with as much truth as the time when men come to the use of reason would be as good a proof that they be innate as to say they be innate because men assent to them when they come to the use of reason i agree then with these men of innate principles that there be no knowledge of these general and selfevident maxims in the mind till it come to the exercise of reason but i deny that the come to the use of reason be the precise time when they be first take notice of and if that be the precise time i deny that it would prove them innate all that can with any truth be mean by this proposition that men assent to them when they come to the use of reason be no more but thisthat the make of general abstract ideas and the understand of general name be a concomitant of the rational faculty and grow up with it children commonly get not those general ideas nor learn the name that stand for them till have for a good while exercise their reason about familiar and more particular ideas they be by their ordinary discourse and action with others acknowledge to be capable of rational conversation if assent ing to these maxims when men come to the use of reason can be true in any other sense i desire it may be show or at least how in this or any other sense it prove them innate the step by which the mind attain several truths the sense at first let in particular ideas and furnish the yet empty cabinet and the mind by degrees grow familiar with some of them they be lodge in the memory and name get to them afterwards the mind proceed further abstract them and by degrees learn the use of general name in this manner the mind come to be furnish with ideas and language the materials about which to exercise its discursive faculty and the use of reason become daily more visible as these materials that give it employment increase but though the have of general ideas and the use of general word and reason usually grow together yet i see not how this any way prove them innate the knowledge of some truths i confess be very early in the mind but in a way that show them not to be innate for if we will observe we shall find it still to be about ideas not innate but acquire it be about those first which be imprint by external things with which infants have earliest to do which make the most frequent impressions on their sense in ideas thus get the mind discover that some agree and others differ probably as soon as it have any use of memory as soon as it be able to retain and perceive distinct ideas but whether it be then or no this be certain it do so long before it have the use of word or come to that which we commonly call the use of reason for a child know as certainly before it can speak the difference between the ideas of sweet and bitter ie that sweet be not bitter as it know afterwards when it come to speak that wormwood and sugarplums be not the same thing assent to suppose innate truths depend on have clear and distinct ideas of what their term mean and not on their innateness a child know not that three and four be equal to seven till he come to be able to count seven and have get the name and idea of equality and then upon explain those word he presently assent to or rather perceive the truth of that proposition but neither do he then readily assent because it be an innate truth nor be his assent want till then because he want the use of reason but the truth of it appear to him as soon as he have settle in his mind the clear and distinct ideas that these name stand for and then he know the truth of that proposition upon the same ground and by the same mean that he know before that a rod and a cherry be not the same thing and upon the same ground also that he may come to know afterwards that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be as shall be more fully show hereafter so that the later it be before any one come to have those general ideas about which those maxims be or to know the signification of those general term that stand for them or to put together in his mind the ideas they stand for the later also will it be before he come to assent to those maximswhose term with the ideas they stand for be no more innate than those of a cat or a weasel he must stay till time and observation have acquaint him with them and then he will be in a capacity to know the truth of these maxims upon the first occasion that shall make him put together those ideas in his mind and observe whether they agree or disagree accord as be express in those proposition and therefore it be that a man know that eighteen and nineteen be equal to thirtyseven by the same selfevidence that he know one and two to be equal to three yet a child know this not so soon as the other not for want of the use of reason but because the ideas the word eighteen nineteen and thirtyseven stand for be not so soon get as those which be signify by one two and three assent as soon as propose and understand prove them not innate this evasion therefore of general assent when men come to the use of reason fail as it do and leave no difference between those suppose innate and other truths that be afterwards acquire and learn men have endeavour to secure an universal assent to those they call maxims by say they be generally assent to as soon as propose and the term they be propose in understand see all men even children as soon as they hear and under stand the term assent to these proposition they think it be sufficient to prove them innate for since men never fail after they have once understand the word to acknowledge them for undoubted truths they would infer that certainly these proposit ions be first lodge in the understand which without any teach the mind at the very first proposal immediately close with and assent to and after that never doubt again if such an assent be a mark of innate then that one and two be equal to three that sweetness be not bitterness and a thousand the like must be innate in answer to this i demand whether ready assent give to a proposition upon first hear and understand the term be a certain mark of an innate principle if it be not such a general assent be in vain urge as a proof of them if it be say that it be a mark of innate they must then allow all such proposition to be innate which be generally assent to as soon as hear whereby they will find themselves plentifully store with innate principles for upon the same grind viz of assent at first hear and understand the term that men would have those maxims pass for innate they must also admit several proposition about number to be innate and thus that one and two be equal to three that two and two be equal to four and a multitude of other the like proposition in number that everybody assent to at first hear and understand the term must have a place amongst these innate axioms nor be this the prerogative of number alone and proposition make about several of them but even natural philosophy and all the other sciences afford proposition which be sure to meet with assent as soon as they be understand that two body can not be in the same place be a truth that nobody any more stick at than at these maxims that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that white be not black that a square be not a circle that bitterness be not sweetness these and a million of such other proposition as many at least as we have distinct ideas of every man in his wits at first hear and know what the name stand for must necessarily assent to if these men will be true to their own rule and have assent at first hear and under stand the term to be a mark of innate they must allow not only as many innate proposition as men have distinct ideas but as many as men can make proposition wherein different ideas be deny one of another since every proposition wherein one different idea be deny of another will as certainly find assent at first hear and understand the term as this general one it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be or that which be the foundation of it and be the easier understand of the two the same be not different by which account they will have legions of innate proposition of this one sort without mention any other but since no proposition can be innate unless the ideas about which it be be innate this will be to suppose all our ideas of colour sound taste figure c innate than which there can not be anything more opposite to reason and experience universal and ready assent upon hear and understand the term be i grant a mark of selfevidence but selfevidence depend not on innate impressions but on something else as we shall show hereafter belong to several proposition which nobody be yet so extravagant as to pretend to be innate such less general proposition know before these universal maxims nor let it be say that those more particular selfevident proposition which be assent to at first hear as that one and two be equal to three that green be not red c be receive as the consequences of those more universal proposition which be look on as innate principles since any one who will but take the pain to observe what pass in the understand will certainly find that these and the like less general proposition be certainly know and firmly assent to by those who be utterly ignorant of those more general maxims and so be earlier in the mind than those as they be call first principles can not owe to them the assent wherewith they be receive at first hear one and one equal to two c not general nor useful answer if it be say that these proposition viz two and two be equal to four red be not blue c be not general maxims nor of any great use i answer that make nothing to the argument of universal assent upon hear and understand for if that be the certain mark of innate whatever proposition can be find that receive general assent as soon as hear and understand that must be admit for an innate proposition as well as this maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be they be upon this grind equal and as to the difference of be more general that make this maxim more remote from be innate those general and abstract ideas be more strangers to our first apprehensions than those of more particular selfevident proposition and therefore it be longer before they be admit and assent to by the grow understand and as to the usefulness of these magnify maxims that perhaps will not be find so great as be generally conceive when it come in its due place to be more fully consider these maxims not be know sometimes till propose prove them not innate but we have not yet do with assent to proposition at first hear and understand their term it be fit we first take notice that this instead of be a mark that they be innate be a proof of the contrary since it suppose that several who understand and know other things be ignorant of these principles till they be propose to them and that one may be unacquainted with these truths till he hear them from others for if they be innate what need they be propose in order to gain assent when by be in the understand by a natural and original impression if there be any such they could not but be know before or doth the propose them print them clearer in the mind than nature do if so then the consequence will be that a man know them better after he have be thus teach them than he do before whence it will follow that these principles may be make more evident to us by others teach than nature have make them by impression which will ill agree with the opinion of innate principles and give but little authority to them but on the contrary make them unfit to be the foundations of all our other knowledge as they be pretend to be this can not be deny that men grow first acquaint with many of these selfevident truths upon their be propose but it be clear that whosoever do so find in himself that he then begin to know a proposition which he know not before and which from thenceforth he never question not because it be innate but because the consideration of the nature of the things contain in those word would not suffer him to think otherwise how or whensoever he be bring to reflect on them and if whatever be assent to at first hear and understand the term must pass for an innate principle every wellgrounded observation draw from particulars into a general rule must be innate when yet it be certain that not all but only sagacious head light at first on these observations and reduce them into general proposition not innate but collect from a precede acquaintance and reflection on particular instance these when observe men have make them unobserving men when they be propose to them can not refuse their assent to implicitly know before propose signify that the mind be capable of understand them or else signify nothing if it be say the understand hath an implicit knowledge of these principles but not an explicit before this first hear as they must who will say that they be in the understand before they be know it will be hard to conceive what be mean by a principle imprint on the understand implicitly unless it be thisthat the mind be capable of understand and assent firmly to such proposition and thus all mathematical demonstrations as well as first principles must be receive as native impressions on the mind which i fear they will scarce allow them to be who find it harder to demonstrate a proposition than assent to it when demonstrate and few mathematicians will be forward to believe that all the diagram they have draw be but copy of those innate character which nature have engraven upon their mind the argument of assent on first hear be upon a false supposition of no precedent teach there be i fear this further weakness in the forego argument which would persuade us that therefore those maxims be to be think innate which men admit at first hear ing because they assent to proposition which they be not teach nor do receive from the force of any argument or demonstration but a bare explication or understand of the term under which there seem to me to lie this fallacy that men be suppose not to be teach nor to learn anything de novo when in truth they be teach and do learn something they be ignorant of before for first it be evident that they have learn the term and their signification neither of which be bear with them but this be not all the acquire knowledge in the case the ideas themselves about which the proposition be be not bear with them no more than their name but get afterwards so that in all proposition that be assent to at first hear the term of the proposition their stand for such ideas and the ideas themselves that they stand for be neither of them innate i would fain know what there be remain in such proposition that be innate for i would gladly have any one name that proposition whose term or ideas be either of them innate we by degrees get ideas and name and learn their appropriate connexion one with another and then to proposition make in such term whose signification we have learn and wherein the agreement or disagreement we can perceive in our ideas when put together be express we at first hear assent though to other proposition in themselves as certain and evident but which be concern ideas not so soon or so easily get we be at the same time no way capable of assent for though a child quickly assent to this proposition that an apple be not fire when by familiar acquaintance he have get the ideas of those two different things distinctly imprint on his mind and have learn that the name apple and fire stand for them yet it will be some years after perhaps before the same child will assent to this proposition that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be because that though perhaps the word be as easy to be learn yet the signification of them be more large comprehensive and abstract than of the name annex to those sensible things the child hath to do with it be longer before he learn their precise mean and it require more time plainly to form in his mind those general ideas they stand for till that be do you will in vain endeavour to make any child assent to a proposition make up of such general term but as soon as ever he have get those ideas and learn their name he forwardly close with the one as well as the other of the forementioned proposition and with both for the same reason viz because he find the ideas he have in his mind to agree or disagree accord as the word stand for them be affirm or deny one of another in the proposition but if proposition be bring to him in word which stand for ideas he have not yet in his mind to such proposition however evidently true or false in themselves he afford neither assent nor dissent but be ignorant for word be but empty sound any further than they be sign of our ideas we can not but assent to them as they correspond to those ideas we have but no further than that but the show by what step and ways knowledge come into our mind and the ground of several degrees of assent be the business of the follow discourse it may suffice to have only touch on it here as one reason that make me doubt of those innate principles not innate because not universally assent to to conclude this argument of universal consent i agree with these defenders of innate principlesthat if they be innate they must need have universal assent for that a truth should be innate and yet not assent to be to me as unintelligible as for a man to know a truth and be ignorant of it at the same time but then by these mens own confession they can not be innate since they be not assent to by those who understand not the term nor by a great part of those who do understand them but have yet never hear nor think of those proposition which i think be at least one half of mankind but be the number far less it would be enough to destroy universal assent and thereby show these proposition not to be innate if children alone be ignorant of them these maxims not the first know but that i may not be accuse to argue from the thoughts of infants which be unknown to us and to conclude from what pass in their understand before they express it i say next that these two general proposition be not the truths that first possess the mind of children nor be antecedent to all acquire and adventitious notions which if they be innate they must need be whether we can determine it or no it matter not there be certainly a time when children begin to think and their word and action do assure us that they do so when therefore they be capable of think of knowledge of assent can it rationally be suppose they can be ignorant of those notions that nature have imprint be there any such can it be imagine with any appearance of reason that they perceive the impressions from things without and be at the same time ignorant of those character which nature itself have take care to stamp within can they receive and assent to adventitious notions and be ignorant of those which be suppose weave into the very principles of their be and imprint there in indelible character to be the foundation and guide of all their acquire knowledge and future reason this would be to make nature take pain to no purpose or at least to write very ill since its character could not be read by those eye which saw other things very well and those be very ill suppose the clearest part of truth and the foundations of all our knowledge which be not first know and without which the undoubted knowledge of several other things may be have the child certainly know that the nurse that feed it be neither the cat it play with nor the blackmoor it be afraid of that the wormseed or mustard it refuse be not the apple or sugar it cry for this it be certainly and undoubtedly assure of but will any one say it be by virtue of this principle that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that it so firmly assent to these and other part of its knowledge or that the child have any notion or apprehension of that proposition at an age wherein yet it be plain it know a great many other truths he that will say children join in these general abstract speculations with their suckingbottles and their rattle may perhaps with justice be think to have more passion and zeal for his opinion but less sincerity and truth than one of that age and so not innate though therefore there be several general proposition that meet with constant and ready assent as soon as propose to men grow up who have attain the use of more general and abstract ideas and name stand for them yet they not be to be find in those of tender years who nevertheless know other things they can not pretend to universal assent of intelligent persons and so by no mean can be suppose innateit be impossible that any truth which be innate if there be any such should be unknown at least to any one who know anything else since if they be innate truths they must be innate thoughts there be nothing a truth in the mind that it have never think on whereby it be evident if there by any innate truths they must necessarily be the first of any think on the first that appear not innate because they appear least where what be innate show itself clearest that the general maxims we be discourse of be not know to children idiots and a great part of mankind we have already sufficiently prove whereby it be evident they have not an universal assent nor be general impressions but there be this further argument in it against their be innate that these character if they be native and original impressions should appear fairest and clearest in those persons in whom yet we find no footsteps of them and it be in my opinion a strong presumption that they be not innate since they be least know to those in whom if they be innate they must need exert themselves with most force and vigour for children idiots savage and illiterate people be of all others the least corrupt by custom or borrow opinions learn and education have not cast their native thoughts into new mould nor by superinducing foreign and study doctrines confound those fair character nature have write there one might reasonably imagine that in their mind these innate notions should lie open fairly to every ones view as it be certain the thoughts of children do it might very well be expect that these principles should be perfectly know to naturals which be stamp immediately on the soul as these men suppose can have no dependence on the constitution or organs of the body the only confess difference between them and others one would think accord to these mens principles that all these native beam of light be there any such should in those who have no reserve no arts of concealment shine out in their full lustre and leave us in no more doubt of their be there than we be of their love of pleasure and abhorrence of pain but alas amongst children idiots savage and the grossly illiterate what general maxims be to be find what universal principles of knowledge their notions be few and narrow borrow only from those object they have have most to do with and which have make upon their sense the frequentest and strongest impressions a child know his nurse and his cradle and by degrees the playthings of a little more advance age and a young savage have perhaps his head fill with love and hunt accord to the fashion of his tribe but he that from a child unteach or a wild inhabitant of the woods will expect these abstract maxims and repute principles of science will i fear find himself mistake such kind of general proposition be seldom mention in the huts of indians much less be they to be find in the thoughts of children or any impressions of them on the mind of naturals they be the language and business of the school and academies of learn nations accustom to that sort of conversation or learn where dispute be frequent these maxims be suit to artificial argumentation and useful for conviction but not much conduce to the discovery of truth or advancement of knowledge but of their small use for the improvement of knowledge i shall have occasion to speak more at large c recapitulation i know not how absurd this may seem to the master of demonstration and probably it will hardly go down with anybody at first hear i must therefore beg a little truce with prejudice and the forbearance of censure till i have be hear out in the sequel of this discourse be very will to submit to better judgments and since i impartially search after truth i shall not be sorry to be convince that i have be too fond of my own notions which i confess we be all apt to be when application and study have warm our head with them upon the whole matter i can not see any grind to think these two speculative maxims innate since they be not universally assent to and the assent they so generally find be no other than what several proposition not allow to be innate equally partake in with them and since the assent that be give them be produce another way and come not from natural inscription as i doubt not but to make appear in the follow discourse and if these first principles of knowledge and science be find not to be innate no other speculative maxims can i suppose with better right pretend to be so no innate practical principles no moral principles so clear and so generally receive as the forementioned speculative maxims if those speculative maxims whereof we discourse in the forego chapter have not an actual universal assent from all mankind as we there prove it be much more visible concern practical principles that they come short of an universal reception and i think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as what be be or to be so manifest a truth as this that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be whereby it be evident that they be further remove from a title to be innate and the doubt of their be native impressions on the mind be stronger against those moral principles than the other not that it bring their truth at all in question they be equally true though not equally evident those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them but moral principles require reason and discourse and some exercise of the mind to discover the certainty of their truth they lie not open as natural character engraven on the mind which if any such be they must need be visible by themselves and by their own light be certain and know to everybody but this be no derogation to their truth and certainty no more than it be to the truth or certainty of the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones because it be not so evident as the whole be bigger than a part nor so apt to be assent to at first hear it may suffice that these moral rule be capable of demonstration and there fore it be our own fault if we come not to a certain knowledge of them but the ignorance wherein many men be of them and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them be manifest proof that they be not innate and such as offer themselves to their view without search faith and justice not own as principles by all men whether there be any such moral principles wherein all men do agree i appeal to any who have be but moderately conversant in the history of mankind and look abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys where be that practical truth that be universally receive without doubt or question as it must be if innate justice and keep of contract be that which most men seem to agree in this be a principle which be think to extend itself to the dens of thieve and the confederacies of the greatest villains and they who have go furthest towards the put off of humanity itself keep faith and rule of justice one with another i grant that outlaw themselves do this one amongst another but it be without receive these as the innate laws of nature they practise them as rule of convenience within their own communities but it be impossible to conceive that he embrace justice as a practical principle who act fairly with his fellowhighwayman and at the same time plunder or kill the next honest man he meet with justice and truth be the common tie of society and therefore even outlaw and robbers who break with all the world besides must keep faith and rule of equity amongst themselves or else they can not hold together but will any one say that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to objection though men deny them in their practice yet they admit them in their thoughts answer perhaps it will be urge that the tacit assent of their mind agree to what their practice contradict i answer first i have always think the action of men the best interpreters of their thoughts but since it be certain that most mens practice and some mens open professions have either question or deny these principles it be impossible to establish an universal consent though we should look for it only amongst grow men without which it be impossible to conclude them innate secondly it be very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles that terminate only in contemplation practical principles derive from nature be there for operation and must produce conformity of action not barely speculative assent to their truth or else they be in vain distinguish from speculative maxims nature i confess have put into man a desire of happiness and an aversion to misery these indeed be innate practical principles which as practical principles ought do continue constantly to operate and influence all our action without cease these may be observe in all persons and all age steady and universal but these be inclinations of the appetite to good not impressions of truth on the understand i deny not that there be natural tendencies imprint on the mind of men and that from the very first instance of sense and perception there be some things that be grateful and others unwelcome to them some things that they incline to and others that they fly but this make nothing for innate character on the mind which be to be the principles of knowledge regulate our practice such natural impressions on the understand be so far from be confirm hereby that this be an argument against them since if there be certain character imprint by nature on the understand as the principles of knowledge we could not but perceive them constantly operate in us and influence our knowledge as we do those others on the will and appetite which never cease to be the constant spring and motives of all our action to which we perpetually feel them strongly impel us moral rule need a proof ergo not innate another reason that make me doubt of any innate practical principles be that i think there can not any one moral rule be propose whereof a man may not justly demand a reason which would be perfectly ridiculous and absurd if they be innate or so much as selfevident which every innate principle must need be and not need any proof to ascertain its truth nor want any reason to gain it approbation he would be think void of com mon sense who ask on the one side or on the other side go to give a reason why it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be it carry its own light and evidence with it and need no other proof he that understand the term assent to it for its own sake or else nothing will ever be able to prevail with him to do it but should that most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue that one should do as he would be do unto be propose to one who never hear of it before but yet be of capacity to understand its mean might he not without any absurdity ask a reason why and be not he that propose it bind to make out the truth and reasonableness of it to him which plainly show it not to be innate for if it be it could neither want nor receive any proof but must need at least as soon as hear and understand be receive and assent to as an unquestionable truth which a man can by no mean doubt of so that the truth of all these moral rule plainly depend upon some other antecedent to them and from which they must be deduce which could not be if either they be innate or so much as selfevident instance in keep compact that men should keep their compact be certainly a great and undeniable rule in morality but yet if a christian who have the view of happiness and misery in another life be ask why a man must keep his word he will give this as a reason because god who have the power of eternal life and death require it of us but if a hobbist be ask why he will answerbecause the public require it and the leviathan will punish you if you do not and if one of the old philosophers have be ask he would have answer because it be dishonest below the dignity of a man and opposite to virtue the highest perfection of human nature to do otherwise virtue generally approve not because innate but because profitable hence naturally flow the great variety of opinions concern moral rule which be to be find among men accord to the different sort of happiness they have a prospect of or propose to themselves which could not be if practical principles be innate and imprint in our mind immediately by the hand of god i grant the existence of god be so many ways manifest and the obedience we owe him so congruous to the light of reason that a great part of mankind give testimony to the law of nature but yet i think it must be allow that several moral rule may receive from mankind a very general approbation without either know or admit the true grind of morality which can only be the will and law of a god who see men in the dark have in his hand reward and punishments and power enough to call to account the proudest offender for god have by an inseparable connexion join virtue and public happiness together and make the practice thereof necessary to the preservation of society and visibly beneficial to all with whom the virtuous man have to do it be no wonder that every one should not only allow but recommend and magnify those rule to others from whose observance of them he be sure to reap advantage to himself he may out of interest as well as conviction cry up that for sacred which if once trample on and profane he himself can not be safe nor secure this though it take nothing from the moral and eternal obligation which these rule evidently have yet it show that the outward acknowledgment men pay to them in their word prove not that they be innate principles nay it prove not so much as that men assent to them inwardly in their own mind as the inviolable rule of their own practice since we find that selfinterest and the conveniences of this life make many men own an outward profession and approbation of them whose action sufficiently prove that they very little consider the lawgiver that prescribe these rule nor the hell that he have ordain for the punishment of those that transgress them mens action convince us that the rule of virtue be not their internal principle for if we will not in civility allow too much sincerity to the professions of most men but think their action to be the interpreters of their thoughts we shall find that they have no such internal veneration for these rule nor so full a persuasion of their certainty and obligation the great principle of morality to do as one would be do to be more commend than practise but the breach of this rule can not be a greater vice than to teach others that it be no moral rule nor obligatory would be think madness and contrary to that interest men sacrifice to when they break it themselves perhaps conscience will be urge as check us for such breach and so the internal obligation and establishment of the rule be preserve conscience no proof of any innate moral rule to which i answer that i doubt not but without be write on their hearts many men may by the same way that they come to the knowledge of other things come to assent to several moral rule and be convince of their obligation others also may come to be of the same mind from their education company and customs of their country which persuasion however get will serve to set conscience on work which be nothing else but our own opinion or judgment of the moral rectitude or pravity of our own action and if conscience be a proof of innate principles contraries may be innate principles since some men with the same bend of conscience prosecute what others avoid instance of enormities practise without remorse but i can not see how any men should ever transgress those moral rule with confidence and serenity be they innate and stamp upon their mind view but an army at the sack of a town and see what observation or sense of moral principles or what touch of conscience for all the outrage they do robberies murder rap be the sport of men set at liberty from punishment and censure have there not be whole nations and those of the most civilize people amongst whom the expose their children and leave them in the field to perish by want or wild beasts have be the practice as little condemn or scruple as the beget them do they not still in some countries put them into the same grave with their mother if they die in childbirth or despatch them if a pretend astrologer declare them to have unhappy star and be there not place where at a certain age they kill or expose their parent without any remorse at all in a part of asia the sick when their case come to be think desperate be carry out and lay on the earth before they be dead and leave there expose to wind and weather to perish without assistance or pity it be familiar among the mingrelians a people profess christianity to bury their children alive without scruple there be place where they eat their own children the caribbees be wont to geld their children on purpose to fat and eat them and garcilasso de la vega tell us of a people in peru which be wont to fat and eat the children they get on their female captives whom they keep as concubines for that purpose and when they be past breed the mother themselves be kill too and eat the virtues whereby the tououpinambos believe they merit paradise be revenge and eat abundance of their enemies they have not so much as a name for god and have no religion no worship the saint who be canonize amongst the turks lead live which one can not with modesty relate a remarkable passage to this purpose out of the voyage of baumgarten which be a book not every day to be meet with i shall set down at large in the language it be publish in ibi sc prope belbes in ægypto vidimus sanctum unum saracenicum inter arenarum cumulos ita ut ex utero matris prodiit nudum sedentem mosest ut

see in pietro della valle in his letter of the th of january where then be those innate principles of justice piety gratitude equity chastity or where be that universal consent that assure us there be such inbred rule murder in duel when fashion have make them honourable be commit without remorse of conscience nay in many place innocence in this case be the greatest ignominy and if we look abroad to take a view of men as they be we shall find that they have remorse in one place for do or omit that which others in another place think they merit by men have contrary practical principles he that will carefully peruse the history of mankind and look abroad into the several tribes of men and with indifferency survey their action will be able to satisfy himself that there be scarce that principle of morality to be name or rule of virtue to be think on those only except that be absolutely necessary to hold society together which commonly too be neglect betwixt distinct societies which be not somewhere or other slight and condemn by the general fashion of whole societies of men govern by practical opinions and rule of live quite opposite to others whole nations reject several moral rule here perhaps it will be object that it be no argument that the rule be not know because it be break i grant the objection good where men though they transgress yet disown not the law where fear of shame censure or punishment carry the mark of some awe it have upon them but it be impossible to conceive that a whole nation of men should all publicly reject and renounce what every one of them certainly and infallibly know to be a law for so they must who have it naturally imprint on their mind it be possible men may sometimes own rule of morality which in their private thoughts they do not believe to be true only to keep themselves in reputation and esteem amongst those who be persuade of their obligation but it be not to be imagine that a whole society of men should publicly and professedly disown and cast off a rule which they could not in their own mind but be infallibly certain be a law nor be ignorant that all men they should have to do with know it to be such and therefore must every one of them apprehend from others all the contempt and abhorrence due to one who profess himself void of humanity and one who confound the know and natural measure of right and wrong can not but be look on as the profess enemy of their peace and happiness whatever practical principle be innate can not but be know to every one to be just and good it be therefore little less than a contradiction to suppose that whole nations of men should both in their professions and practice unanimously and universally give the lie to what by the most invincible evidence every one of them know to be true right and good this be enough to satisfy us that no practical rule which be anywhere universally and with public approbation or allowance transgress can be suppose innatebut i have something further to add in answer to this objection the generally allow breach of a rule proof that it be not innate the break of a rule say you be no argument that it be unknown i grant it but the generally allow breach of it anywhere i say be a proof that it be not innate for example let us take any of these rule which be the most obvious deductions of human reason and comformable to the natural inclination of the greatest part of men fewest people have have the impudence to deny or inconsideration to doubt of if any can be think to be naturally imprint none i think can have a fairer pretence to be innate than this parent preserve and cherish your children when therefore you say that this be an innate rule what do you mean either that it be an innate principle which upon all occasion excite and direct the action of all men or else that it be a truth which all men have imprint on their mind and which therefore they know and assent to but in neither of these sense be it innate first that it be not a principle which influence all mens action be what i have prove by the examples before cite nor need we seek so far as mingrelia or peru to find instance of such as neglect abuse nay and destroy their children or look on it only as the more than brutality of some savage and barbarous nations when we remember that it be a familiar and uncondemned practice amongst the greeks and romans to expose without pity or remorse their innocent infants secondly that it be an innate truth know to all men be also false for parent preserve your children be so far from an innate truth that it be no truth at all it be a command and not a proposition and so not capable of truth or falsehood to make it capable of be assent to as true it must be reduce to some such proposition as this it be the duty of parent to preserve their children but what duty be can not be understand without a law nor a law be know or suppose without a lawmaker or without reward and punishment so that it be impossible that this or any other practical principle should be innate ie be imprint on the mind as a duty without suppose the ideas of god of law of obligation of punishment of a life after this innate for that punishment follow not in this life the breach of this rule and consequently that it have not the force of a law in countries where the generally allow practice run counter to it be in itself evident but these ideas which must be all of them innate if anything as a duty be so be so far from be innate that it be not every studious or think man much less every one that be bear in whom they be to be find clear and distinct and that one of them which of all others seem most likely to be innate be not so i mean the idea of god i think in the next chapter will appear very evident to any consider man if men can be ignorant of what be innate certainty be not describe by innate principles from what have be say i think we may safely conclude that whatever practical rule be in any place generally and with allowance break can not be suppose innate it be impossible that men should without shame or fear confidently and serenely break a rule which they could not but evidently know that god have set up and would certainly punish the breach of which they must if it be innate to a degree to make it a very ill bargain to the transgressor without such a knowledge as this a man can never be certain that anything be his duty ignorance or doubt of the law hop to escape the knowl edge or power of the lawmaker or the like may make men give way to a present appetite but let any one see the fault and the rod by it and with the transgression a fire ready to punish it a pleasure tempt and the hand of the almighty visibly hold up and prepare to take vengeance for this must be the case where any duty be imprint on the mind and then tell me whether it be possible for people with such a prospect such a certain knowledge as this wantonly and without scruple to offend against a law which they carry about them in indelible character and that star them in the face whilst they be break it whether men at the same time that they feel in themselves the imprint edicts of an omnipotent lawmaker can with assurance and gaiety slight and trample underfoot his most sacred injunctions and lastly whether it be possible that whilst a man thus openly bid defiance to this innate law and supreme lawgiver all the bystanders yea even the governors and rulers of the people full of the same sense both of the law and lawmaker should silently connive without testify their dislike or lay the least blame on it principles of action indeed there be lodge in mens appetites but these be so far from be innate moral principles that if they be leave to their full swing they would carry men to the overturn of all morality moral laws be set as a curb and restraint to these exorbitant desire which they can not be but by reward and punishments that will overbalance the satisfaction any one shall propose to himself in the breach of the law if therefore anything be imprint on the mind of all men as a law all men must have a certain and unavoidable knowledge that certain and unavoidable punishment will attend the breach of it for if men can be ignorant or doubtful of what be innate innate principles be insist on and urge to no purpose truth and certainty the things pretend be not at all secure by them but men be in the same uncertain float estate with as without them an evident indubitable knowledge of unavoidable punishment great enough to make the transgression very uneligible must accompany an innate law unless with an innate law they can suppose an innate gospel too i would not here be mistake as if because i deny an innate law i think there be none but positive laws there be a great deal of difference between an innate law and a law of nature between something imprint on our mind in their very original and something that we be ignorant of may attain to the knowledge of by the use and due application of our natural faculties and i think they equally forsake the truth who run into contrary extremes either affirm an innate law or deny that there be a law knowable by the light of nature ie without the help of positive revelation those who maintain innate practical principles tell us not what they be the difference there be amongst men in their practical principles be so evident that i think i need say no more to evince that it will be impossible to find any innate moral rule by this mark of general assent and it be enough to make one suspect that the supposition of such innate principles be but an opinion take up at pleasure since those who talk so confidently of them be so spar to tell us which they be this might with justice be expect from those men who lay stress upon this opinion and it give occasion to distrust either their knowledge or charity who declare that god have imprint on the mind of men the foundations of knowledge and the rule of live be yet so little favourable to the information of their neighbour or the quiet of mankind as not to point out to them which they be in the variety men be distract with but in truth be there any such innate principles there would be no need to teach them do men find such innate proposition stamp on their mind they would easily be able to distinguish them from other truths that they afterwards learn and deduce from them and there would be nothing more easy than to know what and how many they be there could be no more doubt about their number than there be about the number of our finger and it be like then every system would be ready to give them us by tale but since nobody that i know have venture yet to give a catalogue of them they can not blame those who doubt of these innate principles since even they who require men to believe that there be such innate propo sitions do not tell us what they be it be easy to foresee that if different men of different sects should go about to give us a list of those innate practical principles they would set down only such as suit their distinct hypotheses and be fit to support the doctrines of their particular school or church a plain evidence that there be no such innate truths nay a great part of men be so far from find any such innate moral principles in themselves that by deny freedom to mankind and thereby make men no other than bare machine they take away not only innate but all moral rule whatsoever and leave not a possibility to believe any such to those who can not conceive how anything can be capable of a law that be not a free agent and upon that grind they must necessarily reject all principles of virtue who can not put morality and mechanism together which be not very easy to be reconcile or make consistent lord herberts innate principles examine when i have write this be inform that my lord herbert have in his book de veritate assign these innate principles i presently consult him hop to find in a man of so great part something that might satisfy me in this point and put an end to my inquiry in his chapter de instinctu naturali p ed i meet with these six mark of his notitiae commune prioritas independentia universalitas certitudo necessitas ie as he explain it faciunt ad hominis conservationem modus conformationis ie assensus mulla interposita mora and at the latter end of his little treatise de religione laici he say this of these innate principles adeo ut non uniuscujusvis religionis confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent veritates sunt enim in ipsa mente caelitus descriptae nullisque traditionibus sive scriptis sive non scriptis obnoxiae p and veritates nostrae catholicae quae tanquam indubia dei emata inforo interiori descriptae thus have give the mark of the innate principles or common notions and assert their be imprint on the mind of men by the hand of god he proceed to set them down and they be these esse aliquod supremum numen numen illud coli debere virtutem cum pietate conjunctam optimam esse rationem cultus divini resipiscendum esse a peccatis dari praemium vel paenam post hanc vitam transactam though i allow these to be clear truths and such as if rightly explain a rational creature can hardly avoid give his assent to yet i think he be far from prove them innate impressions in foro interiori descriptae for i must take leave to observe these five either not all or more than all if there be any first that these five proposition be either not all or more than all those common notions write on our mind by the finger of god if it be reasonable to believe any at all to be so write since there be other proposition which even by his own rule have as just a pretence to such an original and may be as well admit for innate principles as at least some of these five he enumerate viz do as thou wouldst be do unto and perhaps some hundreds of others when well consider the suppose mark want secondly that all his mark be not to be find in each of his five proposition viz his first second and third mark agree perfectly to neither of them and the first second third fourth and sixth mark agree but ill to his third fourth and fifth proposition for besides that we be assure from history of many men nay whole nations who doubt or disbelieve some or all of them i can not see how the third viz that virtue join with piety be the best worship of god can be an innate principle when the name or sound virtue be so hard to be understand liable to so much uncertainty in its signification and the thing it stand for so much contend about and difficult to be know and therefore this can not be but a very uncertain rule of human practice and serve but very little to the conduct of our live and be therefore very unfit to be assign as an innate practical principle of little use if they be innate for let us consider this proposition as to its mean for it be the sense and not sound that be and must be the principle or common notion viz virtue be the best worship of god ie be most acceptable to him which if virtue be take as most commonly it be for those action which accord to the different opinions of several countries be account laudable will be a proposition so far from be certain that it will not be true if virtue be take for action conformable to gods will or to the rule prescribe by godwhich be the true and only measure of virtue when virtue be use to signify what be in its own nature right and goodthen this proposition that virtue be the best worship of god will be most true and certain but of very little use in human life since it will amount to no more but this viz that god be please with the do of what he commandswhich a man may certainly know to be true without know what it be that god doth command and so be as far from any rule or principle of his action as he be before and i think very few will take a proposition which amount to no more than this viz that god be please with the do of what he himself command for an innate moral principle write on the mind of all men however true and certain it may be since it teach so little whosoever do so will have reason to think hundreds of proposition innate principles since there be many which have as good a title as this to be receive for such which nobody yet ever put into that rank of innate principles scarce possible that god should engrave principles in word of uncertain mean nor be the fourth proposition vizmen must repent of their sin much more instructive till what those action be that be mean by sin be set down for the word peccata or sin be put as it usually be to signify in general ill action that will draw punishment upon the doers what great principle of morality can that be to tell us we should be sorry and cease to do that which will bring mischief upon us without know what those particular action be that will do so indeed this be a very true proposition and fit to be incated on and receive by those who be suppose to have be teach what action in all kinds be sin but neither this nor the former can be imagine to be innate principles nor to be of any use if they be innate unless the particular measure and bound of all virtues and vices be engraven in mens mind and be innate principles also which i think be very much to be doubt and therefore i imagine it will scarcely seem possible that god should engrave principles in mens mind in word of uncertain signification such as virtues and sin which amongst different men stand for different things nay it can not be suppose to be in word at all which be in most of these principles very general name can not be understand but by know the particulars comprehend under them and in the practical instance the measure must be take from the knowledge of the action themselves and the rule of them abstract from word and antecedent to the knowledge of name which rule a man must know what language soever he chance to learn whether english or japan or if he should learn no language at all or never should understand the use of word as happen in the case of dumb and deaf men when it shall be make out that men ignorant of word or unteach by the laws and customs of their country know that it be part of the worship of god not to kill another man not to know more women than one not to procure abortion not to expose their children not to take from another what be his though we want it ourselves but on the contrary relieve and supply his want and whenever we have do the contrary we ought to repent be sorry and resolve to do so no morewhen i say all men shall be prove actually to know and allow all these and a thousand other such rule all of which come under these two general word make use of above viz virtutes et peccata virtues and sin there will be more reason for admit these and the like for common notions and practical principles yet after all universal consent be there any in moral principles to truths the knowledge whereof may be attain otherwise would scarce prove them to be innate which be all i contend for objection innate principles may be corrupt answer nor will it be of much moment here to offer that very ready but not very material answer viz that the innate principles of morality may by education and custom and the general opinion of those amongst whom we converse be darken and at last quite wear out of the mind of men which assertion of theirs if true quite take away the argument of universal consent by which this opinion of innate principles be endeavour to be prove unless those men will think it reasonable that their private persuasions or that of their party should pass for universal consenta thing not unfrequently do when men presume themselves to be the only master of right reason cast by the vote and opinions of the rest of mankind as not worthy the reckon and then their argument stand thusthe principles which all mankind allow for true be innate those that men of right reason admit be the principles allow by all mankind we and those of our mind be men of reason therefore we agree our principles be innatewhich be a very pretty way of argue and a short cut to infallibility for otherwise it will be very hard to understand how there be some principles which all men do acknowledge and agree in and yet there be none of those principles which be not by deprave custom and ill education blot out of the mind of many men which be to say that all men admit but yet many men do deny and dissent from them and indeed the supposition of such first principles will serve us to very little purpose and we shall be as much at a loss with as without them if they may by any human powersuch as the will of our teachers or opinions of our companionsbe alter or lose in us and notwithstanding all this boast of first principles and innate light we shall be as much in the dark and uncertainty as if there be no such thing at all it be all one to have no rule and one that will warp any way or amongst various and contrary rule not to know which be the right but concern innate principles i desire these men to say whether they can or can not by education and custom be blur and blot out if they can not we must find them in all mankind alike and they must be clear in everybody and if they may suffer variation from adventitious notions we must then find them clearest and most perspicuous nearest the fountain in children and illiterate people who have receive least impression from foreign opinions let them take which side they please they will certainly find it inconsistent with visible matter of fact and daily observation contrary principles in the world i easily grant that there be great number of opinions which by men of different countries educations and temper be receive and embrace as first and unquestionable principles many whereof both for their absurdity as well as oppositions to one another it be impossible should be true but yet all those proposition how remote soever from reason be so sacred somewhere or other that men even of good understand in other matter will sooner part with their live and whatever be dearest to them than suffer themselves to doubt or others to question the truth of them how men commonly come by their principles this however strange it may seem be that which every days experience confirm and will not perhaps appear so wonderful if we consider the ways and step by which it be bring about and how really it may come to pass that doctrines that have be derive from no better original than the superstition of a nurse or the authority of an old woman may by length of time and consent of neighbour grow up to the dignity of principles in religion or morality for such who be careful as they call it to principle children well and few there be who have not a set of those principles for them which they believe in instil into the unwary and as yet unprejudiced understand for white paper receive any character those doctrines they would have them retain and profess these be teach them as soon as they have any apprehension and still as they grow up confirm to them either by the open profession or tacit consent of all they have to do with or at least by those of whose wisdom knowledge and piety they have an opinion who never suffer those proposition to be otherwise mention but as the basis and foundation on which they build their religion and manners come by these mean to have the reputation of unquestionable selfevident and innate truths principles suppose innate because we do not remember when we begin to hold them to which we may add that when men so instruct be grow up and reflect on their own mind they can not find anything more ancient there than those opinions which be teach them before their memory begin to keep a register of their action or date the time when any new thing appear to them and therefore make no scruple to conclude that those proposition of whose knowledge they can find in themselves no original be certainly the impress of god and nature upon their mind and not teach them by any one else these they entertain and submit to as many do to their parent with veneration not because it be natural nor do children do it where they be not so teach but because have be always so educate and have no remembrance of the begin of this respect they think it be natural how such principles come to be hold this will appear very likely and almost unavoidable to come to pass if we consider the nature of mankind and the constitution of human affairs wherein most men can not live without employ their time in the daily labour of their call nor be at quiet in their mind without some foundation or principle to rest their thoughts on there be scarcely any one so float and superficial in his understand who hath not some reverence proposition which be to him the principles on which he bottom his reason and by which he judgeth of truth and falsehood right and wrong which some want skill and leisure and others the inclination and some be teach that they ought not to examine there be few to be find who be not expose by their ignorance laziness education or precipitancy to take them upon trust further explain this be evidently the case of all children and young folk and custom a greater power than nature seldom fail to make them worship for divine what she hath inure them to bow their mind and submit their understand to it be no wonder that grow men either perplex in the necessary affairs of life or hot in the pursuit of pleasures should not seriously sit down to examine their own tenets especially when one of their principles be that principles ought not to be question and have men leisure part and will who be there almost that dare shake the foundations of all his past thoughts and action and endure to bring upon himself the shame of have be a long time wholly in mistake and error who be there hardy enough to contend with the reproach which be everywhere prepare for those who dare venture to dissent from the receive opinions of their country or party and where be the man to be find that can patiently prepare himself to bear the name of whimsical sceptical or atheist which he be sure to meet with who do in the least scruple any of the common opinions and he will be much more afraid to question those principles when he shall think them as most men do the standards set up by god in his mind to be the rule and touchstone of all other opinions and what can hinder him from think them sacred when he find them the earliest of all his own thoughts and the most reverence by others a worship of idols it be easy to imagine how by these mean it come to pass than men worship the idols that have be set up in their mind grow fond of the notions they have be long acquaint with there and stamp the character of divinity upon absurdities and errors become zealous votaries to bull and monkey and contend too fight and die in defence of their opinions dum solo credit habendos esse deos quos ipse colit for since the reason faculties of the soul which be almost constantly though not always warily nor wisely employ would not know how to move for want of a foundation and foot in most men who through laziness or avocation do not or for want of time or true help or for other cause can not penetrate into the principles of knowledge and trace truth to its fountain and original it be natural for them and almost unavoidable to take up with some borrow principles which be repute and presume to be the evident proof of other things be think not to need any other proof themselves whoever shall receive any of these into his mind and entertain them there with the reverence usually pay to principles never venture to examine them but accustom himself to believe them because they be to be believe may take up from his education and the fashion of his country any absurdity for innate principles and by long pore on the same object so dim his sight as to take monsters lodge in his own brain for the image of the deity and the workmanship of his hand principles must be examine by this progress how many there be who arrive at principles which they believe innate may be easily observe in the variety of opposite principles hold and contend for by all sort and degrees of men and he that shall deny this to be the method wherein most men proceed to the assurance they have of the truth and evidence of their principles will perhaps find it a hard matter any other way to account for the contrary tenets which be firmly believe confidently assert and which great number be ready at any time to seal with their blood and indeed if it be the privilege of innate principles to be receive upon their own authority without examination i know not what may not be believe or how any ones principles can be question if they may and ought to be examine and try i desire to know how first and innate principles can be try or at least it be reasonable to demand the mark and character whereby the genuine innate principles may be distinguish from others that so amidst the great variety of pretenders i may be keep from mistake in so material a point as this when this be do i shall be ready to embrace such welcome and useful proposition and till then i may with modesty doubt since i fear universal consent which be the only one produce will scarcely prove a sufficient mark to direct my choice and assure me of any innate principles from what have be say i think it past doubt that there be no practical principles wherein all men agree and therefore none innate other considerations concern innate principles both speculative and practical principles not innate unless their ideas be innate have those who would persuade us that there be innate principles not take them together in gross but consider separately the part out of which those proposition be make they would not perhaps have be so forward to believe they be innate since if the ideas which make up those truths be not it be impossible that the proposition make up of them should be innate or our knowledge of them be bear with us for if the ideas be not innate there be a time when the mind be without those principles and then they will not be innate but be derive from some other original for where the ideas themselves be not there can be no knowledge no assent no mental or verbal proposition about them ideas especially those belong to principles not bear with children if we will attentively consider newborn children we shall have little reason to think that they bring many ideas into the world with them for bat perhaps some faint ideas of hunger and thirst and warmth and some pain which they may have felt in the womb there be not the least appearance of any settle ideas at all in them especially of ideas answer the term which make up those universal proposition that be esteem innate principles one may perceive how by degrees afterwards ideas come into their mind and that they get no more nor other than what experience and the observation of things that come in their way furnish them with which might be enough to satisfy us that they be not original character stamp on the mind impossibility and identity not innate ideas it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be certainly if there be any such an innate principle but can any one think or will any one say that impossibility and identity be two innate ideas be they such as all mankind have and bring into the world with them and be they those which be the first in children and antecedent to all acquire ones if they be innate they must need be so hath a child an idea of impossibility and identity before it have of white or black sweet or bitter and be it from the knowledge of this principle that it conclude that wormwood rub on the nipple hath not the same taste that it use to receive from thence be it the actual knowledge of impossible est idem esse et non esse that make a child distinguish between its mother and a stranger or that make it fond of the one and flee the other or do the mind regulate itself and its assent by ideas that it never yet have or the understand draw conclusions from principles which it never yet know or understand the name impossibility and identity stand for two ideas so far from be innate or bear with us that i think it require great care and attention to form them right in our understand they be so far from be bring into the world with us so remote from the thoughts of infancy and childhood that i believe upon examination it will be find that many grow men want them identity an idea not innate if identity to instance that alone be a native impression and consequently so clear and obvious to us that we must need know it even from our cradle i would gladly be resolve by any one of seven or seventy years old whether a man be a creature consist of soul and body be the same man when his body be change whether euphorbus and pythagoras have have the same soul be the same men though they live several age asunder nay whether the cock too which have the same soul be not the same with both of them whereby perhaps it will appear that our idea of sameness be not so settle and clear as to deserve to be think innate in us for if those innate ideas be not clear and distinct so as to be universally know and naturally agree on they can not be subject of universal and undoubted truths but will be the unavoidable occasion of perpetual uncertainty for i suppose every ones idea of identity will not be the same that pythagoras and thousands of his followers have and which then shall be true which innate or be there two different ideas of identity both innate what make the same man nor let any one think that the question i have here propose about the identity of man be bare empty speculations which if they be would be enough to show that there be in the understand of men no innate idea of identity he that shall with a little attention reflect on the resurrection and consider that divine justice will bring to judgment at the last day the very same persons to be happy or miserable in the other who do well or ill in this life will find it perhaps not easy to resolve with himself what make the same man or wherein identity consist and will not be forward to think he and every one even children themselves have naturally a clear idea of it whole and part not innate ideas let us examine that principle of mathematics viz that the whole be bigger than a part this i take it be reckon amongst innate principles i be sure it have as good a title as any to be think so which yet nobody can think it to be when he consider that the ideas it comprehend in it whole and part be perfectly relative but the positive ideas to which they properly and immediately belong be extension and number of which alone whole and part be relations so that if whole and part be innate ideas extension and number must be so too it be impossible to have an idea of a relation without have any at all of the thing to which it belong and in which it be found now whether the mind of men have naturally imprint on them the ideas of extension and number i leave to be consider by these who be the patrons of innate principles idea of worship not innate that god be to be worship be without doubt as great a truth as any that can enter into the mind of man and deserve the first place amongst all practical principles but yet it can by no mean be think innate unless the ideas of god and worship be innate that the idea the term worship stand for be not in the understand of children and a character stamp on the mind in its first original i think will be easily grant by any one that consider how few there be amongst grow men who have a clear and distinct notion of it and i suppose there can not be anything more ridiculous than to say that children have this practical principle innate that god be to be worship and yet that they know not what that worship of god be which be their duty but to pass by this idea of god not innate if any idea can be imagine innate the idea of god may of all others for many reason be think so since it be hard to conceive how there should be innate moral principles without an innate idea of a deity without a notion of a lawmaker it be impossible to have a notion of a law and an obligation to observe it besides the atheists take notice of amongst the ancients and leave brand upon the record of history hath not navigation discover in these later age whole nations at the bay of soldania in brazil in boranday and in the caribbee islands c amongst whom there be to be find no notion of a god no religion nicholaus del techo in literis ex paraquaria de caiguarum conversione have these word reperi eam gentem nullum nomen habere quod deum et hominis animam significet nulla sacra habet nulla idola these be instance of nations where uncultivated nature have be leave to itself without the help of letter and discipline and the improvements of arts and sciences but there be others to be find who have enjoy these in a very great measure who yet for want of a due application of their thoughts this way want the idea and knowledge of god it will i doubt not be a surprise to others as it be to me to find the siamites of this number but for this let them consult the king of frances late envoy thither who give no better account of the chinese themselves and if we will not believe la loubere the missionaries of china even the jesuits themselves the great encomiasts of the chinese do all to a man agree and will convince us that the sect of the literari or learn keep to the old religion of china and the rule party there be all of them atheists vid navarette in the collection of voyage vol i and historia cultus sinensium and perhaps if we should with attention mind the live and discourse of people not so far off we should have too much reason to fear that many in more civilize countries have no very strong and clear impressions of a deity upon their mind and that the complaints of atheism make from the pulpit be not without reason and though only some profligate wretches own it too barefacedly now yet perhaps we should hear more than we do of it from others do not the fear of the magistrates sword or their neighbour censure tie up people tongue which be the apprehensions of punishment or shame take away would as openly proclaim their atheism as their live do the name of god not universal or obscure in mean but have all mankind everywhere a notion of a god whereof yet history tell us the contrary it would not from thence follow that the idea of him be innate for though no nation be to be find without a name and some few dark notions of him yet that would not prove them to be natural impressions on the mind no more than the name of fire or the sun heat or number do prove the ideas they stand for to be innate because the name of those things and the ideas of them be so universally receive and know amongst mankind nor on the contrary be the want of such a name or the absence of such a notion out of mens mind any argument against the be of a god any more than it would be a proof that there be no loadstone in the world because a great part of mankind have neither a notion of any such thing nor a name for it or be any show of argument to prove that there be no distinct and various species of angels or intelligent be above us because we have no ideas of such distinct species or name for them for men be furnish with word by the common language of their own countries can scarce avoid have some kind of ideas of those things whose name those they converse with have occasion frequently to mention to them and if they carry with it the notion of excellency greatness or something extraordinary if apprehension and concernment accompany it if the fear of absolute and irresistible power set it on upon the mindthe idea be likely to sink the deeper and spread the further especially if it be such an idea as be agreeable to the common light of reason and naturally deducible from every part of our knowledge as that of a god be for the visible mark of extraordinary wisdom and power appear so plainly in all the work of the creation that a rational creature who will but seriously reflect on them can not miss the discovery of a deity and the influence that the discovery of such a be must necessarily have on the mind of all that have but once hear of it be so great and carry such a weight of think and communication with it that it seem stranger to me that a whole nation of men should be anywhere find so brutish as to want the notion of a god than that they should be without any notion of number or fire ideas of god and idea of fire the name of god be once mention in any part of the world to express a superior powerful wise invisible be the suitableness of such a notion to the principles of common reason and the interest men will always have to mention it often must necessarily spread it far and wide and continue it down to all generations though yet the general reception of this name and some imperfect and unsteady notions convey thereby to the unthinking part of mankind prove not the idea to be innate but only that they who make the discovery have make a right use of their reason think maturely of the cause of things and trace them to their original from whom other less consider people have once receive so important a notion it could not easily be lose again idea of god not innate this be all could be infer from the notion of a god be it to be find universally in all the tribes of mankind and generally acknowledge by men grow to maturity in all countries for the generality of the acknowledge of a god as i imagine be extend no further than that which if it be sufficient to prove the idea of god innate will as well prove the idea of fire innate since i think it may be truly say that there be not a person in the world who have a notion of a god who have not also the idea of fire i doubt not but if a colony of young children should be place in an island where no fire be they would certainly neither have any notion of such a thing nor name for it how generally soever it be receive and know in all the world besides and perhaps too their apprehensions would be as far remove from any name or notion of a god till some one amongst them have employ his thoughts to inquire into the constitution and cause of things which would easily lead him to the notion of a god which have once teach to others reason and the natural propensity of their own thoughts would afterwards propagate and continue amongst them suitable to gods goodness that all men should have an idea of him therefore naturally imprint by him answer indeed it be urge that it be suitable to the goodness of god to imprint upon the mind of men character and notions of himself and not to leave them in the dark and doubt in so grand a concernment and also by that mean to secure to himself the homage and veneration due from so intelligent a creature as man and therefore he have do it this argument if it be of any force will prove much more than those who use it in this case expect from it for if we may conclude that god hath do for men all that men shall judge be best for them because it be suitable to his goodness so to do it will prove not only that god have imprint on the mind of men an idea of himself but that he hath plainly stamp there in fair character all that men ought to know or believe of him all that they ought to do in obedience to his will and that he hath give them a will and affections conformable to it this no doubt every one will think better for men than that they should in the dark grope after knowledge as st paul tell us all nations do after god act than that their will should clash with their understand and their appetites cross their duty the romanists say it be best for men and so suitable to the goodness of god that there should be an infallible judge of controversies on earth and therefore there be one and i by the same reason say it be better for men that every man himself should be infallible i leave them to consider whether by the force of this argument they shall think that every man be so i think it a very good argument to saythe infinitely wise god hath make it so and therefore it be best but it seem to me a little too much confidence of our own wisdom to sayi think it best and therefore god hath make it so and in the matter in hand it will be in vain to argue from such a topic that god hath do so when certain experience show us that he hath not but the goodness of god hath not be want to men without such original impressions of knowledge or ideas stamp on the mind since he hath furnish man with those faculties which will serve for the sufficient discovery of all things requisite to the end of such a be and i doubt not but to show that a man by the right use of his natural abilities may without any innate principles attain a knowledge of a god and other things that concern him god have endue man with those faculties of knowledge which he hath be no more oblige by his goodness to plant those innate notions in his mind than that have give him reason hand and materials he should build him bridge or houseswhich some people in the world however of good part do either totally want or be but ill provide of as well as others be wholly without ideas of god and principles of morality or at least have but very ill ones the reason in both case be that they never employ their part faculties and power industriously that way but content themselves with the opinions fashion and things of their country as they find them without look any further have you or i be bear at the bay of soldania possibly our thoughts and notions have not exceed those brutish ones of the hottentots that inhabit there and have the virginia king apochancana be educate in england he have be perhaps as know a divine and as good a mathematician as any in it the difference between him and a more improve englishman lie barely in this that the exercise of his faculties be bound within the ways modes and notions of his own country and never direct to any other or further inquiries and if he have not any idea of a god it be only because he pursue not those thoughts that would have lead him to it ideas of god various in different men i grant that if there be any ideas to be find imprint on the mind of men we have reason to expect it should be the notion of his maker as a mark god set on his own workmanship to mind man of his dependence and duty and that herein should appear the first instance of human knowledge but how late be it before any such notion be discoverable in children and when we find it there how much more do it resemble the opinion and notion of the teacher than represent the true god he that shall observe in children the progress whereby their mind attain the knowledge they have will think that the object they do first and most familiarly converse with be those that make the first impressions on their understand nor will he find the least footsteps of any other it be easy to take notice how their thoughts enlarge themselves only as they come to be acquaint with a greater variety of sensible object to retain the ideas of them in their memories and to get the skill to compound and enlarge them and several ways put them together how by these mean they come to frame in their mind an idea men have of a deity i shall hereafter show contrary and inconsistent ideas of god under the same name can it be think that the ideas men have of god be the character and mark of himself engraven in their mind by his own finger when we see that in the same country under one and the same name men have far different nay often contrary and inconsistent ideas and conceptions of him their agree in a name or sound will scarce prove an innate notion of him gross ideas of god what true or tolerable notion of a deity could they have who acknowledge and worship hundreds every deity that they own above one be an infallible evidence of their ignorance of him and a proof that they have no true notion of god where unity infinity and eternity be exclude to which if we add their gross conceptions of corporeity express in their image and representations of their deities the amours marriages copulations lust quarrel and other mean qualities attribute by them to their gods we shall have little reason to think that the heathen world ie the greatest part of mankind have such ideas of god in their mind as he himself out of care that they should not be mistake about him be author of and this universality of consent so much argue if it prove any native impressions it will be only thisthat god imprint on the mind of all men speak the same language a name for himself but not any idea since those people who agree in the name have at the same time far different apprehensions about the thing signify if they say that the variety of deities worship by the heathen world be but figurative ways of express the several attribute of that incomprehensible be or several part of his providence i answer what they might be in the original i will not here inquire but that they be so in the thoughts of the vulgar i think nobody will affirm and he that will consult the voyage of the bishop of beryte c not to mention other testimonies will find that the theology of the siamites professedly own a plurality of gods or as the abbe de choisy more judiciously remark in his journal du voyage de siam it consist properly in acknowledge no god at all idea of god not innate although wise men of all nations come to have it if it be say that wise men of all nations come to have true conceptions of the unity and infinity of the deity i grant it but then this first exclude universality of consent in anything but the name for those wise men be very few perhaps one of a thousand this universality be very narrow secondly it seem to me plainly to prove that the truest and best notions men have of god be not imprint but acquire by think and meditation and a right use of their faculties since the wise and considerate men of the world by a right and careful employment of their thoughts and reason attain true notions in this as well as other things whilst the lazy and inconsiderate part of men make far the greater number take up their notions by chance from common tradition and vulgar conceptions without much beat their head about them and if it be a reason to think the notion of god innate because all wise men have it virtue too must be think innate for that also wise men have always have odd low and pitiful ideas of god common among men this be evidently the case of all gentilism nor hath even amongst jews christians and mahometans who acknowledge but one god this doctrine and the care take in those nations to teach men to have true notions of a god prevail so far as to make men to have the same and the true ideas of him how many even amongst us will be find upon inquiry to fancy him in the shape of a man sit in heaven and to have many other absurd and unfit conceptions of him christians as well as turks have have whole sects own and contend earnestly for itthat the deity be corporeal and of human shape and though we find few now amongst us who profess themselves anthropomorphites though some i have meet with that own it yet i believe he that will make it his business may find amongst the ignorant and uninstructed christians many of that opinion talk but with country people almost of any age or young people almost of any condition and you shall find that though the name of god be frequently in their mouth yet the notions they apply this name to be so odd low and pitiful that nobody can imagine they be teach by a rational man much less that they be character write by the finger of god himself nor do i see how it derogate more from the goodness of god that he have give us mind unfurnished with these ideas of himself than that he hath send us into the world with body unclothe and that there be no art or skill bear with us for be fit with faculties to attain these it be want of industry and consideration in us and not of bounty in him if we have them not it be as certain that there be a god as that the opposite angle make by the intersection of two straight line be equal there be never any rational creature that set himself sincerely to examine the truth of these proposition that could fail to assent to them though yet it be past doubt that there be many men who have not apply their thoughts that way be ignorant both of the one and the other if any one think fit to call this which be the utmost of its extent universal consent such an one i easily allow but such an universal consent as this prove not the idea of god any more than it do the idea of such angle innate if the idea of god be not innate no other can be suppose innate since then though the knowledge of a god be the most natural discovery of human reason yet the idea of him be not innate as i think be evident from what have be say i imagine there will be scarce any other idea find that can pretend to it since if god hath set any impression any character on the understand of men it be most reasonable to expect it should have be some clear and uniform idea of himself as far as our weak capacities be capable to receive so incomprehensible and infinite an object but our mind be at first void of that idea which we be most concern to have it be a strong presumption against all other innate character i must own as far as i can observe i can find none and would be glad to be inform by any other idea of substance not innate i confess there be another idea which would be of general use for mankind to have as it be of general talk as if they have it and that be the idea of substance which we neither have nor can have by sensation or reflection if nature take care to provide us any ideas we might well expect they should be such as by our own faculties we can not procure to ourselves but we see on the contrary that since by those ways whereby other ideas be bring into our mind this be not we have no such clear idea at all and therefore signify nothing by the word substance but only an uncertain supposition of we know not what ie of something whereof we have no particular distinct positive idea which we take to be the substratum or support of those ideas we do know no proposition can be innate since no ideas be innate whatever then we talk of innate either speculative or practical principles it may with as much probability be say that a man hath sterling in his pocket and yet deny that he hath there either penny shill crown or other coin out of which the sum be to be make up as to think that certain proposition be innate when the ideas about which they be can by no mean be suppose to be so the general reception and assent that be give doth not at all prove that the ideas express in them be innate for in many case however the ideas come there the assent to word express the agreement or disagreement of such ideas will necessarily follow every one that hath a true idea of god and worship will assent to this proposition that god be to be worship when express in a language he understand and every rational man that hath not think on it today may be ready to assent to this proposition tomorrow and yet millions of men may be well suppose to want one or both those ideas today for if we will allow savage and most country people to have ideas of god and worship which conversation with them will not make one forward to believe yet i think few children can be suppose to have those ideas which therefore they must begin to have some time or other and then they will also begin to assent to that proposition and make very little question of it ever after but such an assent upon hear no more prove the ideas to be innate than it do that one bear blind with cataracts which will be couch tomorrow have the innate ideas of the sun or light or saffron or yellow because when his sight be clear he will certainly assent to this proposition that the sun be lucid or that saffron be yellow and therefore if such an assent upon hear can not prove the ideas innate it can much less the proposition make up of those ideas if they have any innate ideas i would be glad to be tell what and how many they be no innate ideas in the memory to which let me add if there be any innate ideas any ideas in the mind which the mind do not actually think on they must be lodge in the memory and from thence must be bring into view by remembrance ie must be know when they be remember to have be perceptions in the mind before unless remembrance can be without remembrance for to remember be to perceive anything with memory or with a consciousness that it be perceive or know before without this whatever idea come into the mind be new and not remember this consciousness of its have be in the mind before be that which distinguish remember from all other ways of think whatever idea be never perceive by the mind be never in the mind whatever idea be in the mind be either an actual perception or else have be an actual perception be so in the mind that by the memory it can be make an actual perception again whenever there be the actual perception of any idea without memory the idea appear perfectly new and unknown before to the understand when ever the memory bring any idea into actual view it be with a consciousness that it have be there before and be not wholly a stranger to the mind whether this be not so i appeal to every ones observation and then i desire an instance of an idea pretend to be innate which before any impression of it by ways hereafter to be mention any one could revive and remember as an idea he have formerly know without which consciousness of a former perception there be no remembrance and whatever idea come into the mind without that consciousness be not remember or come not out of the memory nor can be say to be in the mind before that appearance for what be not either actually in view or in the memory be in the mind no way at all and be all one as if it have never be there suppose a child have the use of his eye till he know and distinguish colour but then cataracts shut the windows and he be forty or fifty years perfectly in the dark and in that time perfectly lose all memory of the ideas of colour he once have this be the case of a blind man i once talk with who lose his sight by the smallpox when he be a child and have no more notion of colour than one bear blind i ask whether any one can say this man have then any ideas of colour in his mind any more than one bear blind and i think nobody will say that either of them have in his mind any ideas of colour at all his cataracts be couch and then he have the ideas which he remember not of colour de novo by his restore sight convey to his mind and that without any consciousness of a former acquaintance and these now he can revive and call to mind in the dark in this case all these ideas of colour which when out of view can be revive with a consciousness of a former acquaintance be thus in the memory be say to be in the mind the use i make of this isthat whatever idea be not actually in view be in the mind be there only by be in the memory and if it be not in the memory it be not in the mind and if it be in the memory it can not by the memory be bring into actual view without a perception that it come out of the memory which be this that it have be know before and be now remember if therefore there be any innate ideas they must be in the memory or else nowhere in the mind and if they be in the memory they can be revive without any impression from without and whenever they be bring into the mind they be remember ie they bring with them a perception of their not be wholly new to it this be a constant and distinguish difference between what be and what be not in the memory or in the mindthat what be not in the memory whenever it appear there appear perfectly new and unknown before and what be in the memory or in the mind whenever it be suggest by the memory appear not to be new but the mind find it in itself and know it be there before by this it may be try whether there be any innate ideas in the mind before impression from sensation or reflection i would fain meet with the man who when he come to the use of reason or at any other time remember any of them and to whom after he be bear they be never new if any one will say there be ideas in the mind that be not in the memory i desire him to explain himself and make what he say intelligible principles not innate because of little use or little certainty besides what i have already say there be another reason why i doubt that neither these nor any other principles be innate i that be fully persuade that the infinitely wise god make all things in perfect wisdom can not satisfy myself why he should be suppose to print upon the mind of men some universal principles whereof those that be pretend innate and concern speculation be of no great use and those that concern practice not selfevident and neither of them distinguishable from some other truths not allow to be innate for to what purpose should character be grave on the mind by the finger of god which be not clearer there than those which be afterwards introduce or can not be distinguish from them if any one think there be such innate ideas and proposition which by their clearness and usefulness be distinguishable from all that be adventitious in the mind and acquire it will not be a hard matter for him to tell us which they be and then every one will be a fit judge whether they be so or no since if there be such innate ideas and impressions plainly different from all other perceptions and knowledge every one will find it true in himself of the evidence of these suppose innate maxims i have speak already of their usefulness i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter difference of mens discoveries depend upon the different application of their faculties to conclude some ideas forwardly offer themselves to all mens understand and some sort of truths result from any ideas as soon as the mind put them into proposition other truths require a train of ideas place in order a due compare of them and deductions make with attention before they can be discover and assent to some of the first sort because of their general and easy reception have be mistake for innate but the truth be ideas and notions be no more bear with us than arts and sciences though some of them indeed offer themselves to our faculties more readily than others and therefore be more generally receive though that too be accord as the organs of our body and power of our mind happen to be employ god have fit men with faculties and mean to discover receive and retain truths accord as they be employ the great difference that be to be find in the notions of mankind be from the different use they put their faculties to whilst some and those the most take things upon trust misemploy their power of assent by lazily enslave their mind to the dictate and dominion of others in doctrines which it be their duty carefully to examine and not blindly with an implicit faith to swallow others employ their thoughts only about some few things grow acquaint sufficiently with them attain great degrees of knowledge in them and be ignorant of all other have never let their thoughts loose in the search of other inquiries thus that the three angle of a triangle be quite equal to two right ones be a truth as certain as anything can be and i think more evident than many of those proposition that go for principles and yet there be millions however expert in other things who know not this at all because they never set their thoughts on work about such angle and he that certainly know this proposition may yet be utterly igno rant of the truth of other proposition in mathematics itself which be as clear and evident as this because in his search of those mathematical truths he stop his thoughts short and go not so far the same may happen concern the notions we have of the be of a deity for though there be no truth which a man may more evidently make out to himself than the existence of a god yet he that shall content himself with things as he find them in this world as they minister to his pleasures and passions and not make inquiry a little further into their cause end and admirable contrivances and pursue the thoughts thereof with diligence and attention may live long without any notion of such a be and if any person hath by talk put such a notion into his head he may perhaps believe it but if he hath never examine it his knowledge of it will be no perfecter than his who have be tell that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones take it upon trust without examine the demonstration and may yield his assent as a probable opinion but hath no knowledge of the truth of it which yet his faculties if carefully employ be able to make clear and evident to him but this only by the by to show how much our knowledge depend upon the right use of those power nature hath bestow upon us and how little upon such innate principles as be in vain suppose to be in all mankind for their direction which all men could not but know if they be there or else they would be there to no purpose and which since all men do not know nor can distinguish from other adventitious truths we may well conclude there be no such men must think and know for themselves what censure doubt thus of innate principles may deserve from men who will be apt to call it pull up the old foundations of knowledge and certainty i can not tell i persuade myself at least that the way i have pursue be conformable to truth lay those foundations surer this i be certain i have not make it my business either to quit or follow any authority in the ensue discourse truth have be my only aim and wherever that have appear to lead my thoughts have impartially follow without mind whether the footsteps of any other lay that way or not not that i want a due respect to other mens opinions but after all the greatest reverence be due to truth and i hope it will not be think arrogance to say that perhaps we should make greater progress in the discovery of rational and contemplative knowledge if we seek it in the fountain in the consideration of things themselves and make use rather of our own thoughts than other mens to find it for i think we may as rationally hope to see with other mens eye as to know by other mens understand so much as we ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason so much we possess of real and true knowledge the float of other mens opinions in our brain make us not one jot the more know though they happen to be true what in them be science be in us but opiniatrety whilst we give up our assent only to reverend name and do not as they do employ our own reason to understand those truths which give them reputation aristotle be certainly a know man but nobody ever think him so because he blindly embrace and confidently vent the opinions of another and if the take up of anothers principles without examine them make not him a philosopher i suppose it will hardly make anybody else so in the sciences every one have so much as he really know and comprehend what he believe only and take upon trust be but shred which however well in the whole piece make no considerable addition to his stock who gather them such borrow wealth like fairy money though it be gold in the hand from which he receive it will be but leave and dust when it come to use whence the opinion of innate principles when men have find some general proposition that could not be doubt of as soon as understand it be i know a short and easy way to conclude them innate this be once receive it ease the lazy from the pain of search and stop the inquiry of the doubtful concern all that be once style innate and it be of no small advantage to those who affect to be master and teachers to make this the principle of principlesthat principles must not he question for have once establish this tenetthat there be innate principles it put their followers upon a necessity of receive some doctrines as such which be to take them off from the use of their own reason and judgment and put them on believe and take them upon trust without further examination in which posture of blind credulity they might be more easily govern by and make useful to some sort of men who have the skill and office to principle and guide them nor be it a small power it give one man over another to have the authority to be the dictator of principles and teacher of unquestionable truths and to make a man swallow that for an innate principle which may serve to his purpose who teacheth them whereas have they examine the ways whereby men come to the knowledge of many universal truths they would have find them to result in the mind of men from the be of things themselves when duly consider and that they be discover by the application of those faculties that be fit by nature to receive and judge of them when duly employ about them conclusion to show how the understand proceed herein be the design of the follow discourse which i shall proceed to when i have first premise that hithertoto clear my way to those foundations which i conceive be the only true ones whereon to establish those notions we can have of our own knowledgeit hath be necessary for me to give an account of the reason i have to doubt of innate principles and since the arguments which be against them do some of them rise from common receive opinions i have be force to take several things for grant which be hardly avoidable to any one whose task be to show the falsehood or improbability of any tenetit happen in controversial discourse as it do in assault of towns where if the grind be but firm whereon the batteries be erect there be no further inquiry of whom it be borrow nor whom it belong to so it afford but a fit rise for the present purpose but in the future part of this discourse design to raise an edifice uniform and consistent with itself as far as my own experience and observation will assist me i hope to erect it on such a basis that i shall not need to shore it up with prop and buttress lean on borrow or beg foundations or at least if mine prove a castle in the air i will endeavour it shall be all of a piece and hang together wherein i warn the reader not to expect undeniable cogent demonstrations unless i may be allow the privilege not seldom assume by others to take my principles for grant and then i doubt not but i can demonstrate too all that i shall say for the principles i proceed on be that i can only appeal to mens own unprejudiced experience and observation whether they be true or not and this be enough for a man who profess no more than to lay down candidly and freely his own conjecture concern a subject lie somewhat in the dark without any other design than an unbiased inquiry after truth of ideas of ideas in general and their original idea be the object of think every man be conscious to himself that he think and that which his mind be apply about whilst think be the ideas that be there it be past doubt that men have in their mind several ideassuch as be those express by the word whiten hardness sweetness think motion man elephant army drunkenness and others it be in the first place then to be inquire how he come by them i know it be a receive doctrine that men have native ideas and original character stamp upon their mind in their very first be this opinion i have at large examine already and i suppose what i have say in the forego book will be much more easily admit when i have show whence the understand may get all the ideas it have and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mindfor which i shall appeal to every ones own observation and experience all ideas come from sensation or reflection let us then suppose the mind to be as we say white paper void of all character without any ideashow come it to be furnish whence come it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man have paint on it with an almost endless variety whence have it all the materials of reason and knowledge to this i answer in one word from experience in that all our knowledge be found and from that it ultimately derive itself our observation employ either about external sensible object or about the in ternal operations of our mind perceive and reflect on by ourselves be that which supply our understand with all the materials of think these two be the fountains of knowledge from whence all the ideas we have or can naturally have do spring the object of sensation one source of ideas first our sense conversant about particular sensible object do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things accord to those various ways wherein those object do affect them and thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow white heat cold soft hard bitter sweet and all those which we call sensible qualities which when i say the sense convey into the mind i mean they from external object convey into the mind what produce there those perceptions this great source of most of the ideas we have depend wholly upon our sense and derive by them to the understand i call sensation the operations of our mind the other source of them secondly the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understand with ideas isthe perception of the operations of our own mind within us as it be employ about the ideas it have gotwhich operations when the soul come to reflect on and consider do furnish the understand with another set of ideas which could not be have from things without and such be perception think doubt believe reason know will and all the different act of our own mindswhich we be conscious of and observe in ourselves do from these receive into our understand as distinct ideas as we do from body affect our sense this source of ideas every man have wholly in himself and though it be not sense as have nothing to do with external object yet it be very like it and might properly enough be call internal sense but as i call the other sensation so i call this reflection the ideas it afford be such only as the mind get by reflect on its own operations within itself by reflection then in the follow part of this discourse i would be understand to mean that notice which the mind take of its own operations and the manner of them by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understand these two i say viz external material things as the object of sensation and the operations of our own mind within as the object of reflection be to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings the term operations here i use in a large sense as comprehend not barely the action of the mind about its ideas but some sort of passions arise sometimes from them such as be the satisfaction or uneasiness arise from any think all our ideas be of the one or the other of these the understand seem to me not to have the least glimmer of any ideas which it doth not receive from one of these two external object furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities which be all those different perceptions they produce in us and the mind furnish the understand with ideas of its own operations these when we have take a full survey of them and their several modes combinations and relations we shall find to contain all our whole stock of ideas and that we have nothing in our mind which do not come in one of these two ways let any one examine his own thoughts and thoroughly search into his understand and then let him tell me whether all the original ideas he have there be any other than of the object of his sense or of the operations of his mind consider as object of his reflection and how great a mass of knowledge soever he imagine to be lodge there he will upon take a strict view see that he have not any idea in his mind but what one of these two have imprintedthough perhaps with infinite variety compound and enlarge by the understand as we shall see hereafter observable in children he that attentively consider the state of a child at his first come into the world will have little reason to think him store with plenty of ideas that be to be the matter of his future knowledge it be by degrees he come to be furnish with them and though the ideas of obvious and familiar qualities imprint themselves before the memory begin to keep a register of time or order yet it be often so late before some unusual qualities come in the way that there be few men that can not recollect the begin of their acquaintance with them and if it be worth while no doubt a child might be so order as to have but a very few even of the ordinary ideas till he be grow up to a man but all that be bear into the world be surround with body that perpetually and diversely affect them variety of ideas whether care be take of it or not be imprint on the mind of children light and colour be busy at hand everywhere when the eye be but open sound and some tangible qualities fail not to solicit their proper sense and force an entrance to the mindbut yet i think it will be grant easily that if a child be keep in a place where he never saw any other but black and white till he be a man he would have no more ideas of scarlet or green than he that from his childhood never taste an oyster or a pineapple have of those particular relish men be differently furnish with these accord to the different object they converse with men then come to be furnish with fewer or more simple ideas from without accord as the object they converse with afford greater or less variety and from the operations of their mind within accord as they more or less reflect on them for though he that contemplate the operations of his mind can not but have plain and clear ideas of them yet unless he turn his thoughts that way and consider them attentively he will no more have clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind and all that may be observe therein than he will have all the particular ideas of any landscape or of the part and motion of a clock who will not turn his eye to it and with attention heed all the part of it the picture or clock may be so place that they may come in his way every day but yet he will have but a confuse idea of all the part they be make up of till he apply himself with attention to consider them each in particular ideas of reflection later because they need attention and hence we see the reason why it be pretty late before most children get ideas of the operations of their own mind and some have not any very clear or perfect ideas of the greatest part of them all their live because though they pass there continually yet like float visions they make not deep impressions enough to leave in their mind clear distinct last ideas till the understand turn inward upon itself reflect on its own operations and make them the object of its own contemplation children when they come first into it be surround with a world of new things which by a constant solicitation of their sense draw the mind constantly to them forward to take notice of new and apt to be delight with the variety of change object thus the first years be usually employ and divert in look abroad mens business in them be to acquaint themselves with what be to be find without and so grow up in a constant attention to outward sensations seldom make any considerable reflection on what pass within them till they come to be of riper years and some scarce ever at all the soul begin to have ideas when it begin to perceive to ask at what time a man have first any ideas be to ask when he begin to perceivehaving ideas and perception be the same thing i know it be an opinion that the soul always think and that it have the actual perception of ideas in itself constantly as long as it exist and that actual think be as inseparable from the soul as actual extension be from the body which if true to inquire after the begin of a man ideas be the same as to inquire after the begin of his soul for by this account soul and its ideas as body and its extension will begin to exist both at the same time the soul think not always for this want proof but whether the soul be suppose to exist antecedent to or coeval with or some time after the first rudiments of organization or the beginnings of life in the body i leave to be dispute by those who have better think of that matter i confess myself to have one of those dull souls that doth not perceive itself always to contemplate ideas nor can conceive it any more necessary for the soul always to think than for the body always to move the perception of ideas be as i conceive to the soul what motion be to the body not its essence but one of its operations and therefore though think be suppose never so much the proper action of the soul yet it be not necessary to suppose that it should be always think always in action that perhaps be the privilege of the infinite author and preserver of all things who never slumber nor sleep but be not competent to any finite be at least not to the soul of man we know certainly by experience that we sometimes think and thence draw this infallible consequencethat there be something in us that have a power to think but whether that substance perpetually think or no we can be no further assure than experience inform us for to say that actual think be essential to the soul and inseparable from it be to beg what be in question and not to prove it by reason which be necessary to be do if it be not a selfevident proposition but whether this that the soul always think be a selfevident proposition that everybody assent to at first hear i appeal to mankind it be doubt whether i think at all last night or no the question be about a matter of fact it be beg it to bring as a proof for it an hypothesis which be the very thing in dispute by which way one may prove anything and it be but suppose that all watch whilst the balance beat think and it be sufficiently prove and past doubt that my watch think all last night but he that would not deceive himself ought to build his hypothesis on matter of fact and make it out by sensible experience and not presume on matter of fact because of his hypothesis that be because he suppose it to be so which way of prove amount to this that i must necessarily think all last night because another suppose i always think though i myself can not perceive that i always do so but men in love with their opinions may not only suppose what be in question but allege wrong matter of fact how else could any one make it an inference of mine that a thing be not because we be not sensible of it in our sleep i do not say there be no soul in a man because he be not sensible of it in his sleep but i do say he can not think at any time wake or sleep without be sensible of it our be sensible of it be not necessary to anything but to our thoughts and to them it be and to them it always will be necessary till we can think without be conscious of it it be not always conscious of it i grant that the soul in a wake man be never without think because it be the condition of be awake but whether sleep without dream be not an affection of the whole man mind as well as body may be worth a wake man consideration it be hard to conceive that anything should think and not be conscious of it if the soul doth think in a sleep man without be conscious of it i ask whether during such think it have any pleasure or pain or be capable of happiness or misery i be sure the man be not no more than the bed or earth he lie on for to be happy or miserable without be conscious of it seem to me utterly inconsistent and impossible or if it be possible that the soul can whilst the body be sleep have its think enjoyments and concern its pleasures or pain apart which the man be not conscious of nor partake init be certain that socrates asleep and socrates awake be not the same person but his soul when he sleep and socrates the man consist of body and soul when he be wake be two persons since wake socrates have no knowledge of or concernment for that happiness or misery of his soul which it enjoy alone by itself whilst he sleep without perceive anything of it no more than he have for the happiness or misery of a man in the indies whom he know not for if we take wholly away all consciousness of our action and sensations especially of pleasure and pain and the concernment that accompany it it will be hard to know wherein to place personal identity if a sleep man think without know it the sleep and wake man be two persons the soul during sound sleep think say these men whilst it think and perceive it be capable certainly of those of delight or trouble as well as any other perceptions and it must necessarily be conscious of its own perceptions but it have all this apart the sleep man it be plain be conscious of nothing of all this let us suppose then the soul of castor while he be sleep retire from his body which be no impossible supposition for the men i have here to do with who so liberally allow life without a think soul to all other animals these men can not then judge it impossible or a contradiction that the body should live without the soul nor that the soul should subsist and think or have perception even perception of happiness or misery without the body let us then i say suppose the soul of castor separate during his sleep from his body to think apart let us suppose too that it choose for its scene of think the body of another man vg pollux who be sleep without a soul for if castors soul can think whilst castor be asleep what castor be never conscious of it be no matter what place it choose to think in we have here then the body of two men with only one soul between them which we will suppose to sleep and wake by turn and the soul still think in the wake man whereof the sleep man be never conscious have never the least perception i ask then whether castor and pollux thus with only one soul between them which think and perceive in one what the other be never conscious of nor be concern for be not two as distinct persons as castor and hercules or as socrates and plato be and whether one of them might not be very happy and the other very miserable just by the same reason they make the soul and the man two persons who make the soul think apart what the man be not conscious of for i suppose nobody will make identity of persons to consist in the souls be unite to the very same numercial particles of matter for if that be necessary to identity it will be impossible in that constant flux of the particles of our body that any man should be the same person two days or two moments together impossible to convince those that sleep without dream that they think thus methinks every drowsy nod shake their doctrine who teach that the soul be always think those at least who do at any time sleep without dream can never be convince that their thoughts be sometimes for four hours busy without their know of it and if they be take in the very act wake in the middle of that sleep contemplation can give no manner of account of it that men dream without remember it in vain urge it will perhaps be saidthat the soul think even in the soundest sleep but the memory retain it not that the soul in a sleep man should be this moment busy a think and the next moment in a wake man not remember nor be able to recollect one jot of all those thoughts be very hard to be conceive and would need some better proof than bare assertion to make it be believe for who can without any more ado but be barely tell so imagine that the greatest part of men do during all their live for several hours every day think of something which if they be ask even in the middle of these thoughts they could remember nothing at all of most men i think pass a great part of their sleep without dream i once know a man that be breed a scholar and have no bad memory who tell me he have never dream in his life till he have that fever he be then newly recover of which be about the five or six and twentieth year of his age i suppose the world afford more such instance at least every ones acquaintance will furnish him with examples enough of such as pass most of their nights without dream upon this hypothesis the thoughts of a sleep man ought to be most rational to think often and never to retain it so much as one moment be a very useless sort of think and the soul in such a state of think do very little if at all excel that of a lookingglass which constantly receive variety of image or ideas but retain none they disappear and vanish and there remain no footsteps of them the look glass be never the better for such ideas nor the soul for such thoughts perhaps it will be say that in a wake man the materials of the body be employ and make use of in think and that the memory of thoughts be retain by the impressions that be make on the brain and the trace there leave after such think but that in the think of the soul which be not perceive in a sleep man there the soul think apart and make no use of the organs of the body leave no impressions on it and consequently no memory of such thoughts not to mention again the absurdity of two distinct persons which follow from this supposition i answer further that whatever ideas the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the body it be reasonable to conclude it can retain without the help of the body too or else the soul or any separate spirit will have but little advantage by think if it have no memory of its own thoughts if it can not lay them up for its own use and be able to recall them upon occasion if it can not reflect upon what be past and make use of its former experience reason and contemplations to what purpose do it think they who make the soul a think thing at this rate will not make it a much more noble be than those do whom they condemn for allow it to be nothing but the subtilist part of matter character draw on dust that the first breath of wind efface or impressions make on a heap of atoms or animal spirit be altogether as useful and render the subject as noble as the thoughts of a soul that perish in think that once out of sight be go forever and leave no memory of themselves behind them nature never make excellent things for mean or no use and it be hardly to be conceive that our infinitely wise creator should make so admirable a faculty which come nearest the excellency of his own incomprehensible be to be so idly and uselessly employ at least a fourth part of its time here as to think constantly without remember any of those thoughts without do any good to itself or others or be any way useful to any other part of the creation if we will examine it we shall not find i suppose the motion of dull and senseless matter any where in the universe make so little use of and so wholly throw away on this hypothesis the soul must have ideas not derive from sensation or reflection of which there be no appearance it be true we have sometimes instance of perception whilst we be asleep and retain the memory of those thoughts but how extravagant and incoherent for the most part they be how little conformable to the perfection and order of a rational be those who be acquaint with dream need not be tell this i would willingly be satisfy inwhether the soul when it think thus apart and as it be separate from the body act less rationally than when conjointly with it or no if its separate thoughts be less rational then these men must say that the soul owe the perfection of rational think to the body if it do not it be a wonder that our dream should be for the most part so frivolous and irrational and that the soul should retain none of its more rational soliloquies and meditations if i think when i know it not nobody else can know it those who so confidently tell us that the soul always actually think i would they would also tell us what those ideas be that be in the soul of a child before or just at the union with the body before it hath receive any by sensation the dream of sleep men be as i take it all make up of the wake man ideas though for the most part oddly put together it be strange if the soul have ideas of its own that it derive not from sensation or reflection as it must have if it think before it receive any impressions from the body that it should never in its private think so private that the man himself perceive it not retain any of them the very moment it wake out of them and then make the man glad with new discoveries who can find it reason that the soul should in its retirement during sleep have so many hours thoughts and yet never light on any of those ideas it borrow not from sensation or reflection or at least preserve the memory of none but such which be occasion from the body must need be less natural to a spirit it be strange the soul should never once in a man whole life recall over any of its pure native thoughts and those ideas it have before it borrow anything from the body never bring into the wake man view any other ideas but what have a tang of the cask and manifestly derive their original from that union if it always think and so have ideas before it be unite or before it receive any from the body it be not to be suppose but that during sleep it recollect its native ideas and during that retirement from communicate with the body whilst it think by itself the ideas it be busy about should be sometimes at least those more natural and congenial ones which it have in itself underived from the body or its own operations about them which since the wake man never remember we must from this hypothesis conclude either that the soul remember something that the man do not or else that memory belong only to such ideas as be derive from the body or the mind operations about them how know any one that the soul always think for if it be not a selfevident proposition it need proof i would be glad also to learn from these men who so confidently pronounce that the human soul or which be all one that a man always think how they come to know it nay how they come to know that they themselves think when they themselves do not perceive it this i be afraid be to be sure without proof and to know without perceive it be i suspect a confuse notion take up to serve an hypothesis and none of those clear truths that either their own evidence force us to admit or common experience make it impudence to deny for the most that can be say of it be that it be possible the soul may always think but not always retain it in memory and i say it be as possible that the soul may not always think and much more probable that it should sometimes not think than that it should often think and that a long while together and not be conscious to itself the next moment after that it have think that a man should be busy in think and yet not retain it the next moment very improbable to suppose the soul to think and the man not to perceive it be as have be say to make two persons in one man and if one consider well these mens way of speak one should be lead into a suspicion that they do so for they who tell us that the soul always think do never that i remember say that a man always think can the soul think and not the man or a man think and not be conscious of it this perhaps would be suspect of jargon in others if they say the man think always but be not always conscious of it they may as well say his body be extend without have part for it be altogether as intelligible to say that a body be extend without part as that anything think without be conscious of it or perceive that it do so they who talk thus may with as much reason if it be necessary to their hypothesis say that a man be always hungry but that he do not always feel it whereas hunger consist in that very sensation as think consist in be conscious that one think if they say that a man be always conscious to himself of think i ask how they know it consciousness be the perception of what pass in a man own mind can another man perceive that i be conscious of anything when i perceive it not myself no man knowledge here can go beyond his experience wake a man out of a sound sleep and ask him what he be that moment think of if he himself be conscious of nothing he then think on he must be a notable diviner of thoughts that can assure him that he be think may he not with more reason assure him he be not asleep this be something beyond philosophy and it can not be less than revelation that discover to another thoughts in my mind when i can find none there myself and they must need have a penetrate sight who can certainly see that i think when i can not perceive it myself and when i declare that i do not and yet can see that dog or elephants do not think when they give all the demonstration of it imaginable except only tell us that they do so this some may suspect to be a step beyond the rosicrucians it seem easier to make ones self invisible to others than to make anothers thoughts visible to me which be not visible to himself but it be but define the soul to be a substance that always think and the business be do if such definition be of any authority i know not what it can serve for but to make many men suspect that they have no souls at all since they find a good part of their live pass away without think for no defini tions that i know no suppositions of any sect be of force enough to destroy constant experience and perhaps it be the affectation of know beyond what we perceive that make so much useless dispute and noise in the world no ideas but from sensation and reflection evident if we observe children i see no reason therefore to believe that the soul think before the sense have furnish it with ideas to think on and as those be increase and retain so it come by exercise to improve its faculty of think in the several part of it as well as afterwards by compound those ideas and reflect on its own operations it increase its stock as well as facility in remember imagine reason and other modes of think state of a child in the mother womb he that will suffer himself to be inform by observation and experience and not make his own hypothesis the rule of nature will find few sign of a soul accustom to much think in a newborn child and much fewer of any reason at all and yet it be hard to imagine that the rational soul should think so much and not reason at all and he that will consider that infants newly come into the world spend the greatest part of their time in sleep and be seldom awake but when either hunger call for the teat or some pain the most importunate of all sensations or some other violent impression on the body force the mind to perceive and attend to ithe i say who consider this will perhaps find reason to imagine that a foetus in the mother womb differ not much from the state of a vegetable but pass the greatest part of its time without perception or think do very little but sleep in a place where it need not seek for food and be surround with liquor always equally soft and near of the same temper where the eye have no light and the ears so shut up be not very susceptible of sound and where there be little or no variety or change of object to move the sense the mind think in proportion to the matter it get from experience to think about follow a child from its birth and observe the alterations that time make and you shall find as the mind by the sense come more and more to be furnish with ideas it come to be more and more awake think more the more it have matter to think on after some time it begin to know the object which be most familiar with it have make last impressions thus it come by degrees to know the persons it daily converse with and distinguish them from strangers which be instance and effect of its come to retain and distinguish the ideas the sense convey to it and so we may observe how the mind by degrees improve in these and advance to the exercise of those other faculties of enlarge compound and abstract its ideas and of reason about them and reflect upon all these of which i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter a man begin to have ideas when he first have sensation what sensation be if it shall be demand then when a man begin to have any ideas i think the true answer iswhen he first have any sensation for since there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the sense have convey any in i conceive that ideas in the understand be coeval with sensation which be such an impression or motion make in some part of the body as produce some perception in the understand it be about these impressions make on our sense by outward object that the mind seem first to employ itself in such operations as we call perception remember consideration reason c the original of all our knowledge in time the mind come to reflect on its own operations about the ideas get by sensation and thereby store itself with a new set of ideas which i call ideas of reflection these be the impressions that be make on our sense by outward object that be extrinsical to the mind and its own operations proceed from power intrinsical and proper to itself which when reflect on by itself become also object of its contemplationare as i have say the original of all knowledge thus the first capacity of human intellect isthat the mind be fit to receive the impressions make on it either through the sense by outward object or by its own operations when it reflect on them this be the first step a man make towards the discovery of anything and the groundwork whereon to build all those notions which ever he shall have naturally in this world all those sublime thoughts which tower above the cloud and reach as high as heaven itself take their rise and foot here in all that great extent wherein the mind wander in those remote speculations it may seem to be elevate with it stir not one jot beyond those ideas which sense or reflection have offer for its contemplation in the reception of simple ideas the understand be for the most part passive in this part the understand be merely passive and whether or no it will have these beginnings and as it be materials of knowledge be not in its own power for the object of our sense do many of them obtrude their particular ideas upon our mind whether we will or not and the operations of our mind will not let us be without at least some obscure notions of them no man can be wholly ignorant of what he do when he think these simple ideas when offer to the mind the understand can no more refuse to have nor alter when they be imprint nor blot them out and make new ones itself than a mirror can refuse alter or obliterate the image or ideas which the object set before it do therein produce as the body that surround us do diversely affect our organs the mind be force to receive the impressions and can not avoid the perception of those ideas that be annex to them of simple ideas uncompounded appearances the better to understand the nature manner and extent of our knowledge one thing be carefully to be observe concern the ideas we have and that be that some of them be simple and some complex though the qualities that affect our sense be in the things themselves so unite and blend that there be no separation no distance between them yet it be plain the ideas they produce in the mind enter by the sense simple and unmixed for though the sight and touch often take in from the same object at the same time different ideasas a man see at once motion and colour the hand feel softness and warmth in the same piece of wax yet the simple ideas thus unite in the same subject be as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different sense the coldness and hardness which a man feel in a piece of ice be as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and whiten of a lily or as the taste of sugar and smell of a rise and there be nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception he have of those simple ideas which be each in itself uncompounded contain in it nothing but one uniform appearance or conception in the mind and be not distinguishable into different ideas the mind can neither make nor destroy them these simple ideas the materials of all our knowledge be suggest and furnish to the mind only by those two ways above mention viz sensation and reflection when the understand be once store with these simple ideas it have the power to repeat compare and unite them even to an almost infinite variety and so can make at pleasure new complex ideas but it be not in the power of the most exalt wit or enlarge understand by any quickness or variety of think to invent or frame one new simple idea in the mind not take in by the ways before mention nor can any force of the understand destroy those that be there the dominion of man in this little world of his own understand be muchwhat the same as it be in the great world of visible things wherein his power however manage by art and skill reach no farther than to compound and divide the materials that be make to his hand but can do nothing towards the make the least particle of new matter or destroy one atom of what be already in be the same inability will every one find in himself who shall go about to fashion in his understand one simple idea not receive in by his sense from external object or by reflection from the operations of his own mind about them i would have any one try to fancy any taste which have never affect his palate or frame the idea of a scent he have never smelt and when he can do this i will also conclude that a blind man hath ideas of colour and a deaf man true distinct notions of sound only the qualities that affect the sense be imaginable this be the reason whythough we can not believe it impossible to god to make a creature with other organs and more ways to convey into the understand the notice of corporeal things than those five as they be usually count which he have give to manyet i think it be not possible for any man to imagine any other qualities in body howsoever constitute whereby they can be take notice of besides sound taste smell visible and tangible qualities and have mankind be make but with four sense the qualities then which be the object of the fifth sense have be as far from our notice imagination and conception as now any belong to a sixth seventh or eighth sense can possibly bewhich whether yet some other creatures in some other part of this vast and stupendous universe may not have will be a great presumption to deny he that will not set himself proudly at the top of all things but will consider the immensity of this fabric and the great variety that be to be find in this little and inconsiderable part of it which he have to do with may be apt to think that in other mansions of it there may be other and different intelligent be of whose faculties he have as little knowledge or apprehension as a worm shut up in one drawer of a cabinet hath of the sense or understand of a man such variety and excellency be suitable to the wisdom and power of the maker i have here follow the common opinion of man have but five sense though perhaps there may be justly count morebut either supposition serve equally to my present purpose of simple ideas of sense division of simple ideas the better to conceive the ideas we receive from sensation it may not be amiss for us to consider them in reference to the different ways whereby they make their approach to our mind and make themselves perceivable by us first then there be some which come into our mind by one sense only secondly there be others that convey themselves into the mind by more sense than one thirdly others that be have from reflection only fourthly there be some that make themselves way and be suggest to the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection we shall consider them apart under these several head ideas of one sense there be some ideas which have admittance only through one sense which be peculiarly adapt to receive them thus light and colour as white red yellow blue with their several degrees or shade and mixtures as green scarlet purple seagreen and the rest come in only by the eye all kinds of noise sound and tone only by the ears the several taste and smell by the nose and palate and if these organs or the nerve which be the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brainthe mind presenceroom as i may so call itare any of them so disorder as not to perform their function they have no postern to be admit by no other way to bring themselves into view and be perceive by the understand the most considerable of those belong to the touch be heat and cold and solidity all the rest consist almost wholly in the sensible configuration as smooth and rough or else more or less firm adhesion of the part as hard and soft tough and brittle be obvious enough few simple ideas have name i think it will be needle to enumerate all the particular simple ideas belong to each sense nor indeed be it possible if we would there be a great many more of them belong to most of the sense than we have name for the variety of smell which be as many almost if not more than species of body in the world do most of them want name sweet and stink commonly serve our turn for these ideas which in effect be little more than to call them please or displease though the smell of a rise and violet both sweet be certainly very distinct ideas nor be the different taste that by our palates we receive ideas of much better provide with name sweet bitter sour harsh and salt be almost all the epithets we have to denominate that numberless variety of relish which be to be find distinct not only in almost every sort of creatures but in the different part of the same plant fruit or animal the same may be say of colour and sound i shall therefore in the account of simple ideas i be here give content myself to set down only such as be most material to our present purpose or be in themselves less apt to be take notice of though they be very frequently the ingredients of our complex ideas amongst which i think i may well account solidity which therefore i shall treat of in the next chapter idea of solidity we receive this idea from touch the idea of solidity we receive by our touch and it arise from the resistance which we find in body to the entrance of any other body into the place it possess till it have leave it there be no idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity whether we move or rest in what posture soever we be we always feel something under us that support us and hinder our further sink downwards and the body which we daily handle make us perceive that whilst they remain between them they do by an insurmountable force hinder the approach of the part of our hand that press them that which thus hinder the approach of two body when they be move one towards another i call solidity i will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid be nearer to its original signification than that which mathematicians use it in it suffice that i think the common notion of solidity will allow if not justify this use of it but if any one think it better to call it impenetrability he have my consent only i have think the term solidity the more proper to express this idea not only because of its vulgar use in that sense but also because it carry something more of positive in it than impenetrability which be negative and be perhaps more a consequence of solidity than solidity itself this of all other seem the idea most intimately connect with and essential to body so as nowhere else to be find or imagine but only in matter and though our sense take no notice of it but in mass of matter of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in us yet the mind have once get this idea from such grosser sensible body trace it further and consider it as well as figure in the minutest particle of matter that can exist and find it inseparably inherent in body wherever or however modify solidity fill space this be the idea which belong to body whereby we conceive it to fill space the idea of which fill of space isthat where we imagine any space take up by a solid substance we conceive it so to possess it that it exclude all other solid substances and will for ever hinder any other two body that move towards one another in a straight line from come to touch one another unless it remove from between them in a line not parallel to that which they move in this idea of it th e body whichwe ordinarily handle sufficiently furnish us with distinct from space this resistance whereby it keep other body out of the space which it possess be so great that no force how great soever can surmount it all the body in the world press a drop of water on all side will never be able to overcome the resistance which it will make soft as it be to their approach one another till it be remove out of their way whereby our idea of solidity be distinguish both from pure space which be capable neither of resistance nor motion and from the ordinary idea of hardness for a man may conceive two body at a distance so as they may approach one another without touch or displace any solid thing till their superficies come to meet whereby i think we have the clear idea of space without solidity for not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body i ask whether a man can not have the idea of the motion of one single body alone without any other succeed immediately into its place i think it be evident he can the idea of motion in one body no more include the idea of motion in another than the idea of a square figure in one body include the idea of a square figure in another i do not ask whether body do so exist that the motion of one body can not really be without the motion of another to determine this either way be to beg the question for or against a vacuum but my question iswhether one can not have the idea of one body move whilst others be at rest and i think this no one will deny if so then the place it desert give us the idea of pure space without solidity whereinto any other body may enter without either resistance or protrusion of anything when the sucker in a pump be draw the space it fill in the tube be certainly the same whether any other body follow the motion of the sucker or not nor do it imply a contradiction that upon the motion of one body another that be only contiguous to it should not follow it the necessity of such a motion be build only on the supposition that the world be full but not on the distinct ideas of space and solidity which be as different as resistance and not resistance protrusion and not protrusion and that men have ideas of space without a body their very dispute about a vacuum plainly demonstrate as be show in another place from hardness solidity be hereby also differenced from hardness in that solidity consist in repletion and so an utter exclusion of other body out of the space it possess but hardness in a firm cohesion of the part of matter make up mass of a sensible bulk so that the whole do not easily change its figure and indeed hard and soft be name that we give to things only in relation to the constitutions of our own body that be generally call hard by us which will put us to pain sooner than change figure by the pressure of any part of our body and that on the contrary soft which change the situation of its part upon an easy and unpainful touch but this difficulty of change the situation of the sensible part amongst themselves or of the figure of the whole give no more solidity to the hardest body in the world than to the softest nor be an adamant one jot more solid than water for though the two flat side of two piece of marble will more easily approach each other between which there be nothing but water or air than if there be a diamond between them yet it be not that the part of the diamond be more solid than those of water or resist more but because the part of water be more easily separable from each other they will by a side motion be more easily remove and give way to the approach of the two piece of marble but if they could be keep from make place by that side motion they would eternally hinder the approach of these two piece of marble as much as the diamond and it would be as impossible by any force to surmount their resistance as to surmount the resistance of the part of a diamond the softest body in the world will as invincibly resist the come together of any other two body if it be not put out of the way but remain between them as the hardest that can be find or imagine he that shall fill a yield soft body well with air or water will quickly find its resistance and he that think that nothing but body that be hard can keep his hand from approach one another may be please to make a trial with the air inclose in a football the experiment i have be tell be make at florence with a hollow globe of gold fill with water and exactly close which further show the solidity of so soft a body as water for the golden globe thus fill be put into a press which be drive by the extreme force of screw the water make itself way through the pore of that very close metal and find no room for a nearer approach of its particles within get to the outside where it rise like a dew and so fell in drop before the side of the globe could be make to yield to the violent compression of the engine that squeeze it on solidity depend impulse resistance and protrusion by this idea of solidity be the extension of body distinguish from the extension of spacethe extension of body be nothing but the cohesion or continuity of solid separable movable part and the extension of space the continuity of unsolid inseparable and immovable part upon the solidity of body also depend their mutual impulse resistance and protrusion of pure space then and solidity there be several amongst which i confess myself one who persuade themselves they have clear and distinct ideas and that they can think on space without anything in it that resist or be protrude by body this be the idea of pure space which they think they have as clear as any idea they can have of the extension of body the idea of the distance between the oppo site part of a concave superficies be equally as clear without as with the idea of any solid part between and on the other side they persuade themselves that they have distinct from that of pure space the idea of something that fill space that can be protrude by the impulse of other body or resist their motion if there be others that have not these two ideas distinct but confound them and make but one of them i know not how men who have the same idea under different name or different ideas under the same name can in that case talk with one another any more than a man who not be blind or deaf have distinct ideas of the colour of scarlet and the sound of a trumpet could discourse concern scarlet colour with the blind man i mention in another place who fancy that the idea of scarlet be like the sound of a trumpet what solidity be if any one ask me what this solidity be i send him to his sense to inform him let him put a flint or a football between his hand and then endeavour to join them and he will know if he think this not a sufficient explication of solidity what it be and wherein it consist i promise to tell him what it be and wherein it consist when he tell me what think be or wherein it consist or explain to me what extension or motion be which perhaps seem much easier the simple ideas we have be such as experience teach them us but if beyond that we endeavour by word to make them clearer in the mind we shall succeed no better than if we go about to clear up the darkness of a blind man mind by talk and to discourse into him the ideas of light and colour the reason of this i shall show in another place of simple ideas of divers sense ideas receive both by see and touch the ideas we get by more than one sense be of space or extension figure rest and motion for these make perceivable impressions both on the eye and touch and we can receive and convey into our mind the ideas of the extension figure motion and rest of body both by see and feel but have occasion to speak more at large of these in another place i here only enumerate them i of simple ideas of reflection simple ideas be the operations of mind about its other ideas the mind receive the ideas mention in the forego chapters from without when it turn its view inward upon itself and observe its own action about those ideas it have take from thence other ideas which be as capable to be the object of its contemplation as any of those it receive from foreign things the idea of perception and idea of will we have from reflection the two great and principal action of the mind which be most frequently consider and which be so frequent that every one that please may take notice of them in himself be these two perception or think and volition or will the power of think be call the understand and the power of volition be call the will and these two power or abilities in the mind be denominate faculties of some of the modes of these simple ideas of reflection such as be remembrance discern reason judge knowledge faith c i shall have occasion to speak hereafter ii of simple ideas of both sensation and reflection ideas of pleasure and pain there be other simple ideas which convey themselves into the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection viz pleasure or delight and its opposite pain or uneasiness power existence unity mix with almost all our other ideas delight or uneasiness one or other of them join themselves to almost all our ideas both of sensation and reflection and there be scarce any affection of our sense from with out any retire think of our mind within which be not able to produce in us pleasure or pain by pleasure and pain i would be understand to signify whatsoever delight or molest us whether it arise from the thoughts of our mind or anything operate on our body for whether we call it satisfaction delight pleasure happiness c on the one side or uneasiness trouble pain torment anguish misery c on the other they be still but different degrees of the same thing and belong to the ideas of pleasure and pain delight or uneasiness which be the name i shall most commonly use for those two sort of ideas as motives of our action the infinite wise author of our be have give us the power over several part of our body to move or keep them at rest as we think fit and also by the motion of them to move ourselves and other contiguous body in which consist all the action of our body have also give a power to our mind in several instance to choose amongst its ideas which it will think on and to pursue the inquiry of this or that subject with consideration and attention to excite us to these action of think and motion that we be capable ofhas be please to join to several thoughts and several sensations a perception of delight if this be wholly separate from all our outward sensations and inward thoughts we should have no reason to prefer one think or action to another negligence to attention or motion to rest and so we should neither stir our body nor employ our mind but let our thoughts if i may so call it run adrift without any direction or design and suffer the ideas of our mind like unregarded shadow to make their appearances there as it happen without attend to them in which state man however furnish with the faculties of understand and will would be a very idle inactive creature and pass his time only in a lazy lethargic dream it have therefore please our wise creator to annex to several object and the ideas which we receive from them as also to several of our thoughts a concomitant pleasure and that in several object to several degrees that those faculties which he have endow us with might not remain wholly idle and unemployed by us an end and use of pain pain have the same efficacy and use to set us on work that pleasure have we be as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that as to pursue this only this be worth our consideration that pain be often produce by the same object and ideas that produce pleasure in us this their near conjunction which make us often feel pain in the sensations where we expect pleasure give us new occasion of admire the wisdom and goodness of our maker who design the preservation of our be have annex pain to the application of many things to our body to warn us of the harm that they will do and as advices to withdraw from them but he not design our preservation barely but the preservation of every part and organ in its perfection hath in many case annex pain to those very ideas which delight us thus heat that be very agreeable to us in one degree by a little greater increase of it prove no ordinary torment and the most pleasant of all sensible object light itself if there be too much of it if increase beyond a due proportion to our eye cause a very painful sensation which be wisely and favourably so order by nature that when any object do by the vehemency of its operation disorder the instrument of sensation whose structure can not but be very nice and delicate we might by the pain be warn to withdraw before the organ be quite put out of order and so be unfit for its proper function for the future the consideration of those object that produce it may well persuade us that this be the end or use of pain for though great light be insufferable to our eye yet the highest degree of darkness do not at all disease them because that cause no disorderly motion in it leave that curious organ unharmed in its natural state but yet excess of cold as well as heat pain us because it be equally destructive to that temper which be necessary to the preservation of life and the exercise of the several function of the body and which consist in a moderate degree of warmth or if you please a motion of the insensible part of our body confine within certain bound another end beyond all this we may find another reason why god hath scatter up and down several degrees of pleasure and pain in all the things that environ and affect us and blend them together in almost all that our thoughts and sense have to do withthat we find imperfection dissatisfaction and want of complete happiness in all the enjoyments which the creatures can afford us might be lead to seek it in the enjoyment of him with whom there be fullness of joy and at whose right hand be pleasures for evermore goodness of god in annex pleasure and pain to our other ideas though what i have here say may not perhaps make the ideas of pleasure and pain clearer to us than our own experience do which be the only way that we be capable of have them yet the consideration of the reason why they be annex to so many other ideas serve to give us due sentiments of the wisdom and goodness of the sovereign disposer of all things may not be unsuitable to the main end of these inquiries the knowledge and veneration of him be the chief end of all our thoughts and the proper business of all understand ideas of existence and unity existence and unity be two other ideas that be suggest to the understand by every object without and every idea within when ideas be in our mind we consider them as be actually there as well as we consider things to be actually without uswhich be that they exist or have existence and whatever we can consider as one thing whether a real be or idea suggest to the understand the idea of unity idea of power power also be another of those simple ideas which we receive from sensation and reflection for observe in ourselves that we do and can think and that we can at pleasure move several part of our body which be at rest the effect also that natural body be able to produce in one another occur every moment to our senseswe both these ways get the idea of power idea of succession besides these there be another idea which though suggest by our sense yet be more constantly offer to us by what pass in our mind and that be the idea of succession for if we look immediately into ourselves and reflect on what be observable there we shall find our ideas always whilst we be awake or have any think pass in train one go and another come without intermission simple ideas the materials of all our knowledge these if they be not all be at least as i think the most considerable of those simple ideas which the mind have and out of which be make all its other knowledge all which it receive only by the two forementioned ways of sensation and reflection nor let any one think these too narrow bound for the capacious mind of man to expatiate in which take its flight further than the star and can not be confine by the limit of the world that extend its thoughts often even beyond the utmost expansion of matter and make excursions into that incomprehensible inane i grant all this but desire any one to assign any simple idea which be not receive from one of those inlets before mention or any complex idea not make out of those simple ones nor will it be so strange to think these few simple ideas sufficient to employ the quickest think or largest capacity and to furnish the materials of all that various knowledge and more various fancy and opinions of all mankind if we consider how many word may be make out of the various composition of twentyfour letter or if go one step further we will but reflect on the variety of combinations that may be make with barely one of the abovementioned ideas viz number whose stock be inexhaustible and truly infinite and what a large and immense field doth extension alone afford the mathematicians iii some further considerations concern our simple ideas of sensation positive ideas from privative cause concern the simple ideas of sensation it be to be consideredthat whatsoever be so constitute in nature as to be able by affect our sense to cause any perception in the mind doth thereby produce in the understand a simple idea which whatever be the external cause of it when it come to be take notice of by our discern faculty it be by the mind look on and consider there to be a real positive idea in the understand as much as any other whatsoever though perhaps the cause of it be but a privation of the subject ideas in the mind distinguish from that in things which give rise to them thus the ideas of heat and cold light and darkness white and black motion and rest be equally clear and positive ideas in the mind though perhaps some of the cause which produce them be barely privations in those subject from whence our sense derive those ideas these the understand in its view of them consider all as distinct positive ideas without take notice of the cause that produce them which be an inquiry not belong to the idea as it be in the understand but to the nature of the things exist without us these be two very different things and carefully to be distinguish it be one thing to perceive and know the idea of white or black and quite another to examine what kind of particles they must be and how range in the superficies to make any object appear white or black we may have the ideas when we be ignorant of their physical cause a painter or dyer who never inquire into their cause hath the ideas of white and black and other colour as clearly perfectly and distinctly in his understand and perhaps more distinctly than the philosopher who hath busy himself in consider their natures and think he know how far either of them be in its cause positive or privative and the idea of black be no less positive in his mind than that of white however the cause of that colour in the external object may be only a privation why a privative cause in nature may occasion a positive idea if it be the design of my present undertake to inquire into the natural cause and manner of perception i should offer this as a reason why a privative cause might in some case at least produce a positive idea viz that all sensation be produce in us only by different degrees and modes of motion in our animal spirit variously agitate by external object the abatement of any former motion must as necessarily produce a new sensation as the variation or increase of it and so introduce a new idea which depend only on a different motion of the animal spirit in that organ negative name need not be meaningless but whether this be so or not i will not here determine but appeal to every ones own experience whether the shadow of a man though it consist of nothing but the absence of light and the more the absence of light be the more discernible be the shadow do not when a man look on it cause as clear and positive idea in his mind as a man himself though cover over with clear sunshine and the picture of a shadow be a positive thing indeed we have negative name which stand not directly for positive ideas but for their absence such as insipid silence nihil c which word denote positive ideas vg taste sound be with a signification of their absence whether any ideas be due to cause really privative and thus one may truly be say to see darkness for suppose a hole perfectly dark from whence no light be reflect it be certain one may see the figure of it or it may be paint or whether the ink i write with make any other idea be a question the privative cause i have here assign of positive ideas be accord to the common opinion but in truth it will be hard to determine whether there be really any ideas from a privative cause till it be determine whether rest be any more a privation than motion ideas in the mind qualities in body to discover the nature of our ideas the better and to discourse of them intelligibly it will be convenient to distinguish them as they be ideas or perceptions in our mind and as they be modifications of matter in the body that cause such perceptions in us that so we may not think as perhaps usually be do that they be exactly the image and resemblances of something inherent in the subject most of those of sensation be in the mind no more the liken of something exist without us than the name that stand for them be the liken of our ideas which yet upon hear they be apt to excite in us our ideas and the qualities of body whatsoever the mind perceive in itself or be the immediate object of perception think or understand that i call idea and the power to produce any idea in our mind i call quality of the subject wherein that power be thus a snowball have the power to produce in us the ideas of white cold and roundthe power to produce those ideas in us as they be in the snowball i call qualities and as they be sensations or perceptions in our understand i call them ideas which ideas if i speak of sometimes as in the things themselves i would be understand to mean those qualities in the object which produce them in us primary qualities of body qualities thus consider in body be first such as be utterly inseparable from the body in what state soever it be and such as in all the alterations and change it suffer all the force can be use upon it it constantly keep and such as sense constantly find in every particle of matter which have bulk enough to be perceive and the mind find inseparable from every particle of matter though less than to make itself singly be perceive by our sense vg take a grain of wheat divide it into two part each part have still solidity extension figure and mobility divide it again and it retain still the same qualities and so divide it on till the part become insensible they must retain still each of them all those qualities for division which be all that a mill or pestle or any other body do upon another in reduce it to insensible part can never take away either solidity extension figure or mobility from any body but only make two or more distinct separate mass of matter of that which be but one before all which distinct mass reckon as so many distinct body after division make a certain number these i call original or primary qualities of body which i think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us viz solidity extension figure motion or rest and number secondary qualities of body secondly such qualities which in truth be nothing in the object themselves but power to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities ie by the bulk figure texture and motion of their insensible part as colour sound taste c these i call secondary qualities to these might be add a third sort which be allow to be barely power though they be as much real qualities in the subject as those which i to comply with the common way of speak call qualities but for distinction secondary qualities for the power in fire to produce a new colour or consistency in wax or clayby its primary qualities be as much a quality in fire as the power it have to produce in me a new idea or sensation of warmth or burn which i felt not beforeby the same primary qualities viz the bulk texture and motion of its insensible part how body produce ideas in us the next thing to be consider be how body produce ideas in us and that be manifestly by impulse the only way which we can conceive body to operate in by motion external and in our organism if then external object be not unite to our mind when they produce ideas therein and yet we perceive these original qualities in such of them as singly fall under our sense it be evident that some motion must be thence continue by our nerve or animal spirit by some part of our body to the brain or the seat of sensation there to produce in our mind the particular ideas we have of them and since the extension figure number and motion of body of an observable bigness may be perceive at a distance by the sight it be evident some singly imperceptible body must come from them to the eye and thereby convey to the brain some motion which produce these ideas which we have of them in us how secondary qualities produce their ideas after the same manner that the ideas of these original qualities be produce in us we may conceive that the ideas of secondary qualities be also produce viz by the operation of insensible particles on our sense for it be manifest that there be body and good store of body each whereof be so small that we can not by any of our sense discover either their bulk figure or motionas be evident in the particles of the air and water and others extremely smaller than those perhaps as much smaller than the particles of air and water as the particles of air and water be smaller than peas or hailstoneslet us suppose at present that the differ ent motion and figure bulk and number of such particles affect the several organs of our sense produce in us those different sensations which we have from the colour and smell of body vg that a violet by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter of peculiar figure and bulk and in different degrees and modifications of their motion cause the ideas of the blue colour and sweet scent of that flower to be produce in our mind it be no more impossible to conceive that god should annex such ideas to such motion with which they have no similitude than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel divide our flesh with which that idea hath no resemblance they depend on the primary qualities what i have say concern colour and smell may be understand also of taste and sound and other the like sensible qualities which whatever reality we by mistake attribute to them be in truth nothing in the object themselves but power to produce various sensations in us and depend on those primary qualities viz bulk figure texture and motion of part as i have say ideas of primary qualities be resemblances of secondary not from whence i think it easy to draw this observationthat the ideas of primary qualities of body be resemblances of them and their pattern do really exist in the body themselves but the ideas produce in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all there be nothing like our ideas exist in the body themselves they be in the body we denominate from them only a power to produce those sensations in us and what be sweet blue or warm in idea be but the certain bulk figure and motion of the insensible part in the body themselves which we call so examples flame be denominate hot and light snow white and cold and manna white and sweet from the ideas they produce in us which qualities be commonly think to be the same in those body that those ideas be in us the one the perfect resemblance of the other as they be in a mirror and it would by most men be judge very extravagant if one should say otherwise and yet he that will consider that the same fire that at one distance produce in us the sensation of warmth do at a nearer approach produce in us the far different sensation of pain ought to bethink himself what reason he have to saythat this idea of warmth which be produce in him by the fire be actually in the fire and his idea of pain which the same fire produce in him the same way be not in the fire why be whiten and coldness in snow and pain not when it produce the one and the other idea in us and can do neither but by the bulk figure number and motion of its solid part the ideas of the primary alone really exist the particular bulk number figure and motion of the part of fire or snow be really in themwhether any ones sense perceive them or no and therefore they may be call real qualities because they really exist in those body but light heat whiten or coldness be no more really in them than sickness or pain be in manna take away the sensation of them let not the eye see light or colour nor the ears hear sound let the palate not taste nor the nose smell and all colour taste odours and sound as they be such particular ideas vanish and cease and be reduce to their cause ie bulk figure and motion of part the secondary exist in things only as modes of the primary a piece of manna of a sensible bulk be able to produce in us the idea of a round or square figure and by be remove from one place to another the idea of motion this idea of motion represent it as it really be in manna move a circle or square be the same whether in idea or existence in the mind or in the manna and this both motion and figure be really in the manna whether we take notice of them or no this everybody be ready to agree to besides manna by tie bulk figure texture and motion of its part have a power to produce the sensations of sickness and sometimes of acute pain or grip in us that these ideas of sickness and pain be not in the manna but effect of its operations on us and be nowhere when we feel them not this also every one readily agree to and yet men be hardly to be bring to think that sweetness and whiten be not really in manna which be but the effect of the operations of manna by the motion size and figure of its particles on the eye and palate as the pain and sickness cause by manna be confessedly nothing but the effect of its operations on the stomach and gut by the size motion and figure of its insensible part for by nothing else can a body operate as have be prove as if it could not operate on the eye and palate and thereby produce in the mind particular distinct ideas which in itself it have not as well as we allow it can operate on the gut and stomach and thereby produce distinct ideas which in itself it have not these ideas be all effect of the operations of manna on several part of our body by the size figure number and motion of its partswhy those produce by the eye and palate should rather be think to be really in the manna than those produce by the stomach and gut or why the pain and sickness ideas that be the effect of manna should be think to be nowhere when they be not felt and yet the sweetness and whiten effect of the same manna on other part of the body by ways equally as unknown should be think to exist in the manna when they be not see or taste would need some reason to explain examples let us consider the red and white colour in porphyry hinder light from strike on it and its colour vanish it no longer produce any such ideas in us upon the return of light it produce these appearances on us again can any one think any real alterations be make in the porphyry by the presence or absence of light and that those ideas of whiten and redness be really in porphyry in the light when it be plain it have no colour in the dark it have indeed such a configuration of particles both night and day as be apt by the ray of light rebound from some part of that hard stone to produce in us the idea of redness and from others the idea of whiten but whiten or redness be not in it at any time but such a texture that hath the power to produce such a sensation in us pound an almond and the clear white colour will be alter into a dirty one and the sweet taste into an oily one what real alteration can the beat of the pestle make in any body but an alteration of the texture of it explain how water felt as cold by one hand may be warm to the other ideas be thus distinguish and understand we may be able to give an account how the same water at the same time may produce the idea of cold by one hand and of heat by the other whereas it be impossible that the same water if those ideas be really in it should at the same time be both hot and cold for if we imagine warmth as it be in our hand to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the minute particles of our nerve or animal spirit we may understand how it be possible that the same water may at the same time produce the sensations of heat in one hand and cold in the other which yet figure never do that never producingthe idea of a square by one hand which have produce the idea of a globe by another but if the sensation of heat and cold be nothing but the increase or diminution of the motion of the minute part of our body cause by the corpuscles of any other body it be easy to be understand that if that motion be greater in one hand than in the other if a body be apply to the two hand which have in its minute particles a greater motion than in those of one of the hand and a less than in those of the other it will increase the motion of the one hand and lessen it in the other and so cause the different sensations of heat and cold that depend thereon an excursion into natural philosophy i have in what just go before be engage in physical inquiries a little further than perhaps i intend but it be necessary to make the nature of sensation a little understand and to make the difference between the qualities in body and the ideas produce by them in the mind to be distinctly conceive without which it be impossible to discourse intelligibly of themi hope i shall be pardon this little excursion into natural philosophy it be necessary in our present inquiry to distinguish the primary and real qualities of body which be always in them viz solidity extension figure number and motion or rest and be sometimes perceive by us viz when the body they be in be big enough singly to be discern from those secondary and impute qualities which be but the power of several combinations of those primary ones when they operate without be distinctly discernedwhereby we may also come to know what ideas be and what be not resemblances of something really exist in the body we denominate from them three sort of qualities in body the qualities then that be in body rightly consider be of three sort first the bulk figure number situation and motion or rest of their solid part those be in them whether we perceive them or not and when they be of that size that we can discover them we have by these an idea of the thing as it be in itself as be plain in artificial things these i call primary qualities secondly the power that be in any body by reason of its insensible primary qualities to operate after a peculiar manner on any of our sense and thereby produce in us the different ideas of several colour sound smell taste c these be usually call sensible qualities thirdly the power that be in any body by reason of the particular constitution of its primary qualities to make such a change in the bulk figure texture and motion of another body as to make it operate on our sense differently from what it do before thus the sun have a power to make wax white and fire to make lead fluid these be usually call power the first of these as have be say i think may be properly call real original or primary qualities because they be in the things themselves whether they be perceive or not and upon their different modifications it be that the secondary qualities depend the other two be only power to act differently upon other things which power result from the different modifications of those primary qualities the first be resemblances the second think to be resemblances but be not the third neither be nor be think so but though the two latter sort of qualities be power barely and nothing but power relate to several other body and result from the different modifications of the original qualities yet they be generally otherwise think of for the second sort viz the power to produce several ideas in us by our sense be look upon as real qualities in the things thus affect us but the third sort be call and esteem barely power vg the idea of heat or light which we receive by our eye or touch from the sun be commonly think real qualities exist in the sun and something more than mere power in it but when we consider the sun in reference to wax which it melt or blanch we look on the whiten and softness produce in the wax not as qualities in the sun but effect produce by power in it whereas if rightly consider these qualities of light and warmth which be perceptions in me when i be warm or enlighten by the sun be no otherwise in the sun than the change make in the wax when it be blanch or melt be in the sun they be all of them equally power in the sun depend on its primary qualities whereby it be able in the one case so to alter the bulk figure texture or motion of some of the insensible part of my eye or hand as thereby to produce in me the idea of light or heat and in the other it be able so to alter the bulk figure texture or motion of the insensible part of the wax as to make them fit to produce in me the distinct ideas of white and fluid why the secondary be ordinarily take for real qualities and not for bare power the reason why the one be ordinarily take for real qualities and the other only for bare power seem to be because the ideas we have of distinct colour sound c contain nothing at all in them of bulk figure or motion we be not apt to think them the effect of these primary qualities which appear not to our sense to operate in their production and with which they have not any apparent congruity or conceivable connexion hence it be that we be so forward to imagine that those ideas be the resemblances of something really exist in the object themselves since sensation discover nothing of bulk figure or motion of part in their production nor can reason show how body by their bulk figure and motion should produce in the mind the ideas of blue or yellow c but in the other case in the operations of body change the qualities one of another we plainly discover that the quality produce hath commonly no resemblance with anything in the thing produce it wherefore we look on it as a bare effect of power for through receive the idea of heat or light from the sun we be apt to think it be a perception and resemblance of such a quality in the sun yet when we see wax or a fair face receive change of colour from the sun we can not imagine that to be the reception or resemblance of anything in the sun because we find not those different colour in the sun itself for our sense be able to observe a liken or unlikeness of sensible qualities in two different external object we forwardly enough conclude the production of any sensible quality in any subject to be an effect of bare power and not the communication of any quality which be really in the efficient when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that produce it but our sense not be able to discover any unlikeness between the idea produce in us and the quality of the object produce it we be apt to imagine that our ideas be resemblances of something in the object and not the effect of certain power place in the modification of their primary qualities with which primary qualities the ideas produce in us have no resemblance secondary qualities twofold first immediately perceivable secondly mediately perceivable to conclude besides those beforementioned primary qualities in body viz bulk figure extension number and motion of their solid part all the rest whereby we take notice of body and distinguish them one from another be nothing else but several power in them depend on those primary qualities whereby they be fit either by immediately operate on our body to produce several different ideas in us or else by operate on other body so to change their primary qualities as to render them capable of produce ideas in us different from what before they do the former of these i think may be call secondary qualities immediately perceivable the latter secondary qualities mediately perceivable of perception perception the first simple idea of reflection perception as it be the first faculty of the mind exercise about our ideas so it be the first and simplest idea we have from reflection and be by some call think in general though think in the propriety of the english tongue signify that sort of operation in the mind about its ideas wherein the mind be active where it with some degree of voluntary attention consider anything for in bare naked perception the mind be for the most part only passive and what it perceive it can not avoid perceive reflection alone can give us the idea of what perception be what perception be every one will know better by reflect on what he do himself when he see hear feel c or think than by any discourse of mine whoever reflect on what pass in his own mind can not miss it and if he do not reflect all the word in the world can not make him have any notion of it arise in sensation only when the mind notice the organic impression this be certain that whatever alterations be make in the body if they reach not the mind whatever impressions be make on the outward part if they be not take notice of within there be no perception fire may burn our body with no other effect than it do a billet unless the motion be continue to the brain and there the sense of heat or idea of pain be produce in the mind wherein consist actual perception impulse on the organ insufficient how often may a man observe in himself that whilst his mind be intently employ in the contemplation of some object and curiously survey some ideas that be there it take no notice of impressions of sound body make upon the organ of hear with the same alteration that use to be for the produce the idea of sound a sufficient impulse there may be on the organ but it not reach the observation of the mind there follow no perception and though the motion that use to produce the idea of sound be make in the ear yet no sound be hear want of sensation in this case be not through any de fect in the organ or that the man ears be less affect than at other time when he do hear but that which use to produce the idea though convey in by the usual organ not be take notice of in the understand and so imprint no idea in the mind there follow no sensation so that wherever there be sense or perception there some idea be actually produce and present in the understand children though they may have ideas in the womb have none innate therefore i doubt not but children by the exercise of their sense about object that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas before they be bear as the unavoidable effect either of the body that environ them or else of those want or diseases they suffer amongst which if one may conjecture concern things not very capable of examination i think the ideas of hunger and warmth be two which probably be some of the first that children have and which they scarce ever part with again the effect of sensation in the womb but though it be reasonable to imagine that children receive some ideas before they come into the world yet these simple ideas be far from those innate principles which some contend for and we above have reject these here mention be the effect of sensation be only from some affections of the body which happen to them there and so depend on something exterior to the mind no otherwise differ in their manner of production from other ideas derive from sense but only in the precedency of time whereas those innate principles be suppose to be quite of another nature not come into the mind by any accidental alterations in or operations on the body but as it be original character impress upon it in the very first moment of its be and constitution which ideas appear first be not evident nor important as there be some ideas which we may reasonably suppose may be introduce into the mind of children in the womb subservient to the necessities of their life and be there so after they be bear those ideas be the earliest imprint which happen to be the sensible qualities which first occur to them amongst which light be not the least considerable nor of the weakest efficacy and how covetous the mind be to be furnish with all such ideas as have no pain accompany them may be a little guess by what be observable in children newborn who always turn their eye to that part from whence the light come lay them how you please but the ideas that be most familiar at first be various accord to the divers circumstances of childrens first entertainment in the world the order wherein the several ideas come at first into the mind be very various and uncertain also neither be it much material to know it sensations often change by the judgment we be further to consider concern perception that the ideas we receive by sensation be often in grow people alter by the judgment without our take notice of it when we set before our eye a round globe of any uniform colour vg gold alabaster or jet it be certain that the idea thereby imprint on our mind be of a flat circle variously shadow with several degrees of light and brightness come to our eye but we have by use be accustom to perceive what kind of appearance convex body be wont to make in us what alterations be make in the reflections of light by the difference of the sensible figure of bodiesthe judgment presently by an habitual custom alter the appearances into their cause so that from that which be truly variety of shadow or colour collect the figure it make it pass for a mark of figure and frame to itself the perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour when the idea we receive from thence be only a plane variously colour as be evident in paint to which purpose i shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge the learn and worthy mr molyneux which he be please to send me in a letter some months since and it be thissuppose a man bear blind and now adult and teach by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and the other which be the cube which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere place on a table and the blind man be make to see quaere whether by his sight before he touch them he could now distinguish and tell which be the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answer not for though he have obtain the experience of how a globe how a cube affect his touch yet he have not yet obtain the experience that what affect his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that press his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it do in the cubei agree with this think gentleman whom i be proud to call my friend in his answer to this problem and be of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which be the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them though he could unerringly name them by his touch and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figure felt this i have set down and leave with my reader as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be behold to experience improvement and acquire notions where he think he have not the least use of or help from them and the rather because this observe gentleman further add that have upon the occasion of my book propose this to divers very ingenious men he hardly ever meet with one that at first give the answer to it which he think true till by hear his reason they be convince this judgment apt to be mistake for direct perception but this be not i think usual in any of our ideas but those receive by sight because sight the most comprehensive of all our sense convey to our mind the ideas of light and colour which be peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion the several varieties whereof change the appearances of its proper object viz light and colour we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by the other this in many case by a settle habitin things whereof we have frequent experience be perform so constantly and so quick that we take that for the perception of our sensation which be an idea form by our judgment so that one viz that of sensation serve only to excite the other and be scarce take notice of itselfas a man who read or hear with attention and understand take little notice of the character or sound but of the ideas that be excite in him by them how by habit ideas of sensation be unconsciously change into ideas of judgment nor need we wonder that this be do with so little notice if we consider how quick the action of the mind be perform for as itself be think to take up no space to have no extension so its action seem to require no time but many of them seem to be crowd into an instant i speak this in comparison to the action of the body any one may easily observe this in his own thoughts who will take the pain to reflect on them how as it be in an instant do our mind with one glance see all the part of a demonstration which may very well be call a long one if we consider the time it will require to put it into word and step by step show it another secondly we shall not be so much surprise that this be do in us with so little notice if we consider how the facility which we get of do things by a custom of do make them often pass in us without our notice habit especially such as be begin very early come at last to produce action in us which often escape our observation how frequently do we in a day cover our eye with our eyelids without perceive that we be at all in the dark men that by custom have get the use of a byword do almost in every sentence pronounce sound which though take notice of by others they themselves neither hear nor observe and therefore it be not so strange that our mind should often change the idea of its sensation into that of its judgment and make one serve only to excite the other without our take notice of it perception put the difference between animals and vegetables this faculty of perception seem to me to be that which put the distinction betwixt the animal kingdom and the inferior part of nature for however vegetables have many of them some degrees of motion and upon the different application of other body to them do very briskly alter their figure and motion and so have obtain the name of sensitive plant from a motion which have some resemblance to that which in animals follow upon sensation yet i suppose it be all bare mechanism and no otherwise produce than the turn of a wild oatbeard by the insinuation of the particles of moisture or the shorten of a rope by the affusion of water all which be do without any sensation in the subject or the have or receive any ideas perception in all animals perception i believe be in some degree in all sort of animals though in some possibly the avenues provide by nature for the reception of sensations be so few and the perception they be receive with so obscure and dull that it come extremely short of the quickness and variety of sensation which be in other animals but yet it be sufficient for and wisely adapt to the state and condition of that sort of animals who be thus make so that the wisdom and goodness of the maker plainly appear in all the part of this stupendous fabric and all the several degrees and rank of creatures in it accord to their condition we may i think from the make of an oyster or cockle reasonably conclude that it have not so many nor so quick sense as a man or several other animals nor if it have would it in that state and incapacity of transfer itself from one place to another be better by them what good would sight and hear do to a creature that can not move itself to or from the object wherein at a distance it perceive good or evil and would not quickness of sensation be an inconvenience to an animal that must lie still where chance have once place it and there receive the afflux of colder or warmer clean or foul water as it happen to come to it decay of perception in old age but yet i can not but think there be some small dull perception whereby they be distinguish from perfect insensibility and that this may be so we have plain instance even in mankind itself take one in whom decrepit old age have blot out the memory of his past knowledge and clearly wipe out the ideas his mind be formerly store with and have by destroy his sight hear and smell quite and his taste to a great degree stop up almost all the passages for new ones to enter or if there be some of the inlets yet half open the impressions make be scarcely perceive or not at all retain how far such an one notwithstanding all that be boast of innate principles be in his knowledge and intellectual faculties above the condition of a cockle or an oyster i leave to be consider and if a man have pass sixty years in such a state as it be possible he might as well as three days i wonder what difference there would be in any intellectual perfections between him and the lowest degree of animals perception the inlet of all materials of knowledge perception then be the first step and degree towards knowledge and the inlet of all the materials of it the fewer sense any man as well as any other creature hath and the fewer and duller the impressions be that be make by them and the duller the faculties be that be employ about themthe more remote be they from that knowledge which be to be find in some men but this be in great variety of degrees as may be perceive amongst men can not certainly be discover in the several species of animals much less in their particular individuals it suffice me only to have remark herethat perception be the first operation of all our intellectual faculties and the inlet of all knowledge in our mind and i be apt too to imagine that it be perception in the lowest degree of it which put the boundaries between animals and the inferior rank of creatures but this i mention only as my conjecture by the by it be indifferent to the matter in hand which way the learn shall determine of it of retention contemplation the next faculty of the mind whereby it make a further progress towards knowledge be that which i call retention or the keep of those simple ideas which from sensation or reflection it hath receive this be do two ways first by keep the idea which be bring into it for some time actually in view which be call contemplation memory the other way of retention be the power to revive again in our mind those ideas which after im print have disappear or have be as it be lay aside out of sight and thus we do when we conceive heat or light yellow or sweetthe object be remove this be memory which be as it be the storehouse of our ideas for the narrow mind of man not be capable of have many ideas under view and consideration at once it be necessary to have a repository to lay up those ideas which at another time it might have use of but our ideas be nothing but actual perceptions in the mind which cease to be anything when there be no perception of them this lay up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signify no more but thisthat the mind have a power in many case to revive perceptions which it have once have with this additional perception annex to them that it have have them before and in this sense it be that our ideas be say to be in our memories when indeed they be actually nowherebut only there be an ability in the mind when it will to revive them again and as it be paint them anew on itself though some with more some with less difficulty some more lively and others more obscurely and thus it be by the assistance of this faculty that we be say to have all those ideas in our understand which though we do not actually contemplate yet we can bring in sight and make appear again and be the object of our thoughts without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprint them there attention repetition pleasure and pain fix ideas attention and repetition help much to the fix any ideas in the memory but those which naturally at first make the deepest and most last impressions be those which be accompany with pleasure or pain the great business of the sense be to make us take notice of what hurt or advantage the body it be wisely order by nature as have be show that pain should accompany the reception of several ideas which supply the place of consideration and reason in children and act quicker than consideration in grow men make both the old and young avoid painful object with that haste which be necessary for their preservation and in both settle in the memory a caution for the future ideas fade in the memory concern the several degrees of last wherewith ideas be imprint on the memory we may observethat some of them have be produce in the understand by an object affect the sense once only and no more than once others that have more than once offer themselves to the sense have yet be little take notice of the mind either heedless as in children or otherwise employ as in men intent only on one thing not set the stamp deep into itself and in some where they be set on with care and repeat impressions either through the temper of the body or some other fault the memory be very weak in all these case ideas in the mind quickly fade and often vanish quite out of the understand leave no more footsteps or remain character of themselves than shadow do fly over field of corn and the mind be as void of them as if they have never be there cause of oblivion thus many of those ideas which be produce in the mind of children in the begin of their sensation some of which perhaps as of some pleasures and pain be before they be bear and others in their infancy if the future course of their live they be not repeat again be quite lose without the least glimpse remain of them this may be observe in those who by some mischance have lose their sight when they be very young in whom the ideas of colour have be but slightly take notice of and cease to be repeat do quite wear out so that some years after there be no more notion nor memory of colour leave in their mind than in those of people bear blind the memory of some men it be true be very tenacious even to a miracle but yet there seem to be a constant decay of all our ideas even of those which be strike deepest and in mind the most retentive so that if they be not sometimes renew by repeat exercise of the sense or reflection on those kinds of object which at first occasion them the print wear out and at last there remain nothing to be see thus the ideas as well as children of our youth often die before us and our mind represent to us those tombs to which we be approach where though the brass and marble remain yet the inscriptions be efface by time and the imagery moulder away the picture draw in our mind be lay in fade colour and if not sometimes refresh vanish and disappear how much the constitution of our body and the make of our animal spirit be concern in this and whether the temper of the brain make this difference that in some it retain the character draw on it like marble in others like freestone and in others little better than sand i shall not here inquire though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body do sometimes influence the memory since we oftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas and the flame of a fever in a few days calcine all those image to dust and confusion which seem to be as last as if grave in marble constantly repeat ideas can scarce be lose but concern the ideas themselves it be easy to remark that those that be oftenest refresh amongst which be those that be convey into the mind by more ways than one by a frequent return of the object or action that produce them fix themselves best in the memory and remain clearest and longest there and therefore those which be of the original qualities of body vis solidity extension figure motion and rest and those that almost constantly affect our body as heat and cold and those which be the affections of all kinds of be as existence duration and number which almost every object that affect our sense every think which employ our mind bring along with them these i say and the like ideas be seldom quite lose whilst the mind retain any ideas at all in remember the mind be often active in this secondary perception as i may so call it or view again the ideas that be lodge in the memory the mind be oftentimes more than barely passive the appearance of those dormant picture depend sometimes on the will the mind very often set itself on work in search of some hide idea and turn as it be the eye of the soul upon it though sometimes too they start up in our mind of their own accord and offer themselves to the understand and very often be rouse and tumble out of their dark cells into open daylight by turbulent and tempestuous passions our affections bring ideas to our memory which have otherwise lie quiet and unregarded this further be to be observe concern ideas lodge in the memory and upon occasion revive by the mind that they be not only as the word revive import none of them new ones but also that the mind take notice of them as of a former impression and renew its acquaintance with them as with ideas it have know before so that though ideas formerly imprint be not all constantly in view yet in remembrance they be constantly know to be such as have be formerly imprint ie in view and take notice of before by the understand two defect in the memory oblivion and slowness memory in an intellectual creature be necessary in the next degree to perception it be of so great moment that where it be want all the rest of our faculties be in a great measure useless and we in our thoughts reason and knowledge could not proceed beyond present object be it not for the assistance of our memories wherein there may be two defect first that it lose the idea quite and so far it produce perfect ignorance for since we can know nothing further than we have the idea of it when that be go we be in perfect ignorance secondly that it move slowly and retrieve not the ideas that it have and be lay up in store quick enough to serve the mind upon occasion this if it be to a great degree be stupidity and he who through this default in his memory have not the ideas that be really preserve there ready at hand when need and occasion call for them be almost as good be without them quite since they serve him to little purpose the dull man who lose the opportunity whilst he be seek in his mind for those ideas that should serve his turn be not much more happy in his knowledge than one that be perfectly ignorant it be the business therefore of the memory to furnish to the mind those dormant ideas which it have present occasion for in the have them ready at hand on all occasion consist that which we call invention fancy and quickness of part a defect which belong to the memory of man as finite these be defect we may observe in the memory of one man compare with another there be another defect which we may conceive to be in the memory of man in generalcompared with some superior create intellectual be which in this faculty may so far excel man that they may have constantly in view the whole scene of all their former action wherein no one of the thoughts they have ever have may slip out of their sight the omniscience of god who know all things past present and to come and to whom the thoughts of mens hearts always lie open may satisfy us of the possibility of this for who can doubt but god may communicate to those glorious spirit his immediate attendants any of his perfections in what proportion he please as far as create finite be can be capable it be report of that prodigy of part monsieur pascal that till the decay of his health have impair his memory he forget nothing of what he have do read or think in any part of his rational age this be a privilege so little know to most men that it seem almost incredible to those who after the ordinary way measure all others by themselves but yet when consider may help us to enlarge our thoughts towards greater perfections of it in superior rank of spirit for this of monsieur pascal be still with the narrowness that human mind be confine to hereof have great variety of ideas only by succession not all at once whereas the several degrees of angels may probably have larger view and some of them be endow with capacities able to retain together and constantly set before them as in one picture all their past knowledge at once this we may conceive would be no small advantage to the knowledge of a think manif all his past thoughts and reason could be always present to him and therefore we may suppose it one of those ways wherein the knowledge of separate spirit may exceedingly surpass ours brutes have memory this faculty of lay up and retain the ideas that be bring into the mind several other animals seem to have to a great degree as well as man for to pass by other instance bird learn of tune and the endeavour one may observe in them to hit the note right put it past doubt with me that they have perception and retain ideas in their memories and use them for pattern for it seem to me impossible that they should endeavour to conform their voice to note as it be plain they do of which they have no ideas for though i should grant sound may mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal spirit in the brain of those bird whilst the tune be actually play and that motion may be continue on to the muscle of the wing and so the bird mechanically be drive away by certain noise because this may tend to the bird preservation yet that can never be suppose a reason why it should cause mechanicallyeither whilst the tune be play much less after it have ceasedsuch a motion of the organs in the bird voice as should conform it to the note of a foreign sound which imitation can be of no use to the bird preservation but which be more it can not with any appearance of reason be suppose much less prove that bird without sense and memory can approach their note nearer and nearer by degrees to a tune play yesterday which if they have no idea of in their memory be now nowhere nor can be a pattern for them to imitate or which any repeat essay can bring them nearer to since there be no reason why the sound of a pipe should leave trace in their brain which not at first but by their afterendeavours should produce the like sound and why the sound they make themselves should not make trace which they should follow as well as those of the pipe be impossible to conceive of discern and other operations of the mind no knowledge without discernment another faculty we may take notice of in our mind be that of discern and distinguish between the several ideas it have it be not enough to have a confuse perception of something in general unless the mind have a distinct perception of different object and their qualities it would be capable of very little knowledge though the body that affect us be as busy about us as they be now and the mind be continually employ in think on this faculty of distinguish one thing from another depend the evidence and certainty of several even very general proposition which have pass for innate truthsbecause men overlook the true cause why those proposition find universal assent impute it wholly to native uniform impressions whereas it in truth depend upon this clear discern faculty of the mind whereby it perceive two ideas to be the same or different but of this more hereafter the difference of wit and judgment how much the imperfection of accurately discriminate ideas one from another lie either in the dulness or fault of the organs of sense or want of acuteness exercise or attention in the understand or hastiness and precipitancy natural to some temper i will not here examine it suffice to take notice that this be one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself it be of that consequence to its other knowledge that so far as this faculty be in itself dull or not rightly make use of for the distinguish one thing from anotherso far our notions be confuse and our reason and judgment disturb or mislead if in have our ideas in the memory ready at hand consist quickness of part in this of have them unconfused and be able nicely to distinguish one thing from another where there be but the least difference consist in a great measure the exactness of judgment and clearness of reason which be to be observe in one man above another and hence perhaps may be give some reason of that common observationthat men who have a great deal of wit and prompt memories have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason for wit lie most in the assemblage of ideas and put those together with quickness and variety wherein can be find any resemblance or congruity thereby to make up pleasant picture and agreeable visions in the fancy judgment on the contrary lie quite on the other side in separate carefully one from another ideas wherein can be find the least difference thereby to avoid be mislead by similitude and by affinity to take one thing for another this be a way of proceed quite contrary to metaphor and allusion wherein for the most part lie that entertainment and pleasantry of wit which strike so lively on the fancy and therefore be so acceptable to all people because its beauty appear at first sight and there be require no labor of think to examine what truth or reason there be in it the mind without look any further rest satisfy with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy and it be a kind of affront to go about to examine it by the severe rule of truth and good reason whereby it appear that it consist in something that be not perfectly conformable to them clearness do hinder confusion to the well distinguish our ideas it chiefly contribute that they be clear and determinate and when they be so it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them though the sense should as sometimes they do convey them from the same object differently on different occasion and so seem to err for though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste which at another time would produce a sweet one yet the idea of bitter in that man mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he have taste only gall nor do it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produce at one time one and at another time another idea by the taste than it make a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet or white and round that the same piece of sugar produce them both in the mind at the same time and the ideas of orangecolour and azure that be produce in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephriticum be no less distinct ideas than those of the same colour take from two very different body compare the compare them one with another in respect of extent degrees time place or any other circumstances be another operation of the mind about its ideas and be that upon which depend all that large tribe of ideas comprehend under relation which of how vast an extent it be i shall have occasion to consider hereafter brutes compare but imperfectly how far brutes partake in this faculty be not easy to determine i imagine they have it not in any great degree for though they probably have several ideas distinct enough yet it seem to me to be the prerogative of human understand when it have sufficiently distinguish any ideas so as to perceive them to be perfectly different and so consequently two to cast about and consider in what circumstances they be capable to be compare and therefore i think beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annex to the object themselves the other power of compare which may be observe in men belong to general ideas and useful only to abstract reason we may probably conjecture beasts have not compound the next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas be composition whereby it put together several of those simple ones it have receive from sensation and reflection and combine them into complex ones under this of composition may be reckon also that of enlarge wherein though the composition do not so much appear as in more complex ones yet it be nevertheless a put several ideas together though of the same kind thus by add several units together we make the idea of a dozen and put together the repeat ideas of several perch we frame that of a furlong brutes compound but little in this also i suppose brutes come far short of man for though they take in and retain together several combinations of simple ideas as possibly the shape smell and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog have of him or rather be so many distinct mark whereby he know him yet i do not think they do of themselves ever compound them and make complex ideas and perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas it be only one simple one that direct them in the knowledge of several things which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine for i have be credibly inform that a bitch will nurse play with and be fond of young fox as much as and in place of her puppies if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them and those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once appear not to have any knowledge of their number for though they be mightily concern for any of their young that be take from them whilst they be in sight or hear yet if one or two of them be steal from them in their absence or without noise they appear not to miss them or to have any sense that their number be lessen name when children have by repeat sensations get ideas fix in their memories they begin by degrees to learn the use of sign and when they have get the skill to apply the organs of speech to the frame of articulate sound they begin to make use of word to signify their ideas to others these verbal sign they sometimes borrow from others and sometimes make themselves as one may observe among the new and unusual name children often give to things in the first use of language abstraction the use of word then be to stand as outward mark of our internal ideas and those ideas be take from particular things if every particular idea that we take in should have a distinct name name must be endless to prevent this the mind make the particular ideas receive from particular object to become general which be do by consider them as they be in the mind such appearancesseparate from all other existences and the circumstances of real existence as time place or any other concomitant ideas this be call abstraction whereby ideas take from particular be become general representatives of all of the same kind and their name general name applicable to whatever exist conformable to such abstract ideas such precise naked appearances in the mind without consider how whence or with what others they come there the understand lay up with name commonly annex to them as the standards to rank real existences into sort as they agree with these pattern and to denominate them accordingly thus the same colour be observe today in chalk or snow which the mind yesterday receive from milk it consider that appearance alone make it a representative of all of that kind and have give it the name whiten it by that sound signify the same quality wheresoever to be imagine or meet with and thus universals whether ideas or term be make brutes abstract not if it may be doubt whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to any degree this i think i may be positive inthat the power of abstract be not at all in them and that the have of general ideas be that which put a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and be an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no mean attain to for it be evident we observe no footsteps in them of make use of general sign for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstract or make general ideas since they have no use of word or any other general sign brutes abstract not yet be not bare machine nor can it be impute to their want of fit organs to frame articulate sound that they have no use or knowledge of general word since many of them we find can fashion such sound and pronounce word distinctly enough but never with any such application and on the other side men who through some defect in the organs want word yet fail not to express their universal ideas by sign which serve them instead of general word a faculty which we see beasts come short in and therefore i think we may suppose that it be in this that the species of brutes be discriminate from man and it be that proper difference wherein they be wholly separate and which at last widen to so vast a distance for if they have any ideas at all and be not bare machine as some would have them we can not deny them to have some reason it seem as evident to me that they do some of them in certain instance reason as that they have sense but it be only in particular ideas just as they receive them from their sense they be the best of them tie up within those narrow bound and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction idiots and madmen how far idiots be concern in the want or weakness of any or all of the forego faculties an exact observation of their several ways of faultering would no doubt discover for those who either perceive but dully or retain the ideas that come into their mind but ill who can not readily excite or compound them will have little matter to think on those who can not distinguish compare and abstract would hardly be able to understand and make use of language or judge or reason to any tolerable degree but only a little and imperfectly about things present and very familiar to their sense and indeed any of the forementioned faculties if want or out of order produce suitable defect in mens understand and knowledge difference between idiots and madmen in fine the defect in naturals seem to proceed from want of quickness activity and motion in the intellectual faculties whereby they be deprive of reason whereas madmen on the other side seem to suffer by the other extreme for they do not appear to me to have lose the faculty of reason but have join together some ideas very wrongly they mistake them for truths and they err as men do that argue right from wrong principles for by the violence of their imaginations have take their fancy for realities they make right deductions from them thus you shall find a distract man fancy himself a king with a right inference require suitable attendance respect and obedience others who have think themselves make of glass have use the caution necessary to preserve such brittle body hence it come to pass that a man who be very sober and of a right understand in all other things may in one particular be as frantic as any in bedlam if either by any sudden very strong impression or long fix his fancy upon one sort of thoughts incoherent ideas have be cement together so powerfully as to remain unite but there be degrees of madness as of folly the disorderly jumble ideas together be in some more and some less in short herein seem to lie the difference between idiots and madmen that madmen put wrong ideas together and so make wrong proposition but argue and reason right from them but idiots make very few or no proposition and reason scarce at all method follow in this explication of faculties these i think be the first faculties and operations of the mind which it make use of in understand and though they be exercise about all its ideas in general yet the instance i have hitherto give have be chiefly in simple ideas and i have subjoin the explication of these faculties of the mind to that of simple ideas before i come to what i have to say concern complex ones for these follow reason first because several of these faculties be exercise at first principally about simple ideas we might by follow nature in its ordinary method trace and discover them in their rise progress and gradual improvements secondly because observe the faculties of the mind how they operate about simple ideaswhich be usually in most mens mind much more clear precise and distinct than complex oneswe may the better examine and learn how the mind extract denominate compare and exercise in its other operations about those which be complex wherein we be much more liable to mistake thirdly because these very operations of the mind about ideas receive from sensations be themselves when reflect on another set of ideas derive from that other source of our knowledge which i call reflection and therefore fit to be consider in this place after the simple ideas of sensation of compound compare abstract c i have but just speak have occasion to treat of them more at large in other place the true begin of human knowledge and thus i have give a short and i think true history of the first beginnings of human knowledgewhence the mind have its first object and by what step it make its progress to the lay in and store up those ideas out of which be to be frame all the knowledge it be capable of wherein i must appeal to experience and observation whether i be in the right the best way to come to truth be to examine things as really they be and not to conclude they be as we fancy of ourselves or have be teach by others to imagine appeal to experience to deal truly this be the only way that i can discover whereby the ideas of things be bring into the understand if other men have either innate ideas or infuse principles they have reason to enjoy them and if they be sure of it it be impossible for others to deny them the privilege that they have above their neighbour i can speak but of what i find in myself and be agreeable to those notions which if we will examine the whole course of men in their several age countries and educations seem to depend on those foundations which i have lay and to correspond with this method in all the part and degrees thereof dark room i pretend not to teach but to inquire and therefore can not but confess here againthat external and internal sensation be the only passages i can find of knowledge to the understand these alone as far as i can discover be the windows by which light be let into this dark room for methinks the understand be not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light with only some little open leave to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things without would the picture come into such a dark room but stay there and lie so orderly as to be find upon occasion it would very much resemble the understand of a man in reference to all object of sight and the ideas of them these be my guess concern the mean whereby the understand come to have and retain simple ideas and the modes of them with some other operations about them i proceed now to examine some of these simple ideas and their modes a little more particularly of complex ideas make by the mind out of simple ones we have hitherto consider those ideas in the reception whereof the mind be only passive which be those simple ones receive from sensation and reflection before mention whereof the mind can not make one to itself nor have any idea which do not wholly consist of them but as the mind be wholly passive in the reception of all its simple ideas so it exert several act of its own whereby out of its simple ideas as the materials and foundations of the rest the others be frame the act of the mind wherein it exert its power over its simple ideas be chiefly these three combine several simple ideas into one compound one and thus all complex ideas be make the second be bring two ideas whether simple or complex together and set them by one another so as to take a view of them at once without unite them into one by which way it get all its ideas of relations the third be separate them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence this be call abstraction and thus all its general ideas be make this show man power and its ways of operation to be much the same in the material and intellectual world for the materials in both be such as he have no power over either to make or destroy all that man can do be either to unite them together or to set them by one another or wholly separate them i shall here begin with the first of these in the consideration of complex ideas and come to the other two in their due place as simple ideas be observe to exist in several combinations unite together so the mind have a power to consider several of them unite together as one idea and that not only as they be unite in external object but as itself have join them together ideas thus make up of several simple ones put together i call complexsuch as be beauty gratitude a man an army the universe which though complicate of various simple ideas or complex ideas make up of simple ones yet be when the mind please consider each by itself as one entire thing and signify by one name make voluntarily in this faculty of repeat and join together its ideas the mind have great power in vary and multiply the object of its thoughts infinitely beyond what sensation or reflection furnish it with but all this still confine to those simple ideas which it receive from those two source and which be the ultimate materials of all its compositions for simple ideas be all from things themselves and of these the mind can have no more nor other than what be suggest to it it can have no other ideas of sensible qualities than what come from without by the sense nor any ideas of other kind of operations of a think substance than what it find in itself but when it have once get these simple ideas it be not confine barely to observation and what offer itself from without it can by its own power put together those ideas it have and make new complex ones which it never receive so unite complex ideas be either of modes substances or relations complex ideas however compound and decompounded though their number be infinite and the variety endless wherewith they fill and entertain the thoughts of men yet i think they may be all reduce under these three head modes substances relations ideas of modes first modes i call such complex ideas which however compound contain not in them the supposition of subsist by themselves but be consider as dependences on or affections of substances such as be the ideas signify by the word triangle gratitude murder c and if in this i use the word mode in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification i beg pardon it be unavoidable in discourse differ from the ordinary receive notions either to make new word or to use old word in somewhat a new signification the later whereof in our present case be perhaps the more tolerable of the two simple and mix modes of simple ideas of these modes there be two sort which deserve distinct consideration first there be some which be only variations or different combinations of the same simple idea without the mixture of any otheras a dozen or score which be nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units add together and these i call simple modes as be contain within the bound of one simple idea secondly there be others compound of simple ideas of several kinds put together to make one complex onevg beauty consist of a certain composition of colour and figure cause delight to the beholder theft which be the conceal change of the possession of anything without the consent of the propri etor contain as be visible a combination of several ideas of several kinds and these i call mix modes ideas of substances single or collective secondly the ideas of substances be such combinations of simple ideas as be take to represent distinct particular things subsist by themselves the suppose or confuse idea of substance such as it be be always the first and chief thus if to substance be join the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour with certain degrees of weight hardness ductility and fusibility we have the idea of lead and a combination of the ideas of a certain sort of figure with the power of motion think and reason join to substance the ordinary idea of a man now of substances also there be two sort of ideas one of single substances as they exist separately as of a man or a sheep the other of several of those put together as an army of men or flock of sheepwhich collective ideas of several substances thus put together be as much each of them one single idea as that of a man or an unit ideas of relation thirdly the last sort of complex ideas be that we call relation which consist in the consideration and compare one idea with another of these several kinds we shall treat in their order the abstrusest ideas we can have be all from two source if we trace the progress of our mind and with attention observe how it repeat add together and unite its simple ideas receive from sensation or reflection it will lead us further than at first perhaps we should have imagine and i believe we shall find if we warily observe the originals of our notions that even the most abstruse ideas how remote soever they may seem from sense or from any operations of our own mind be yet only such as the understand frame to itself by repeat and join together ideas that it have either from object of sense or from its own operations about them so that those even large and abstract ideas be derive from sensation or reflection be no other than what the mind by the ordinary use of its own faculties employ about ideas receive from object of sense or from the operations it observe in itself about them may and do attain unto this i shall endeavour to show in the ideas we have of space time and infinity and some few others that seem the most remote from those originals complex ideas of simple modes and first of the simple modes of the idea of space simple modes of simple ideas though in the forego part i have often mention simple ideas which be truly the materials of all our knowledge yet have treat of them there rather in the way that they come into the mind than as distinguish from others more compound it will not be perhaps amiss to take a view of some of them again under this consideration and examine those different modifications of the same idea which the mind either find in things exist or be able to make within itself without the help of any extrinsical object or any foreign suggestion those modifications of any one simple idea which as have be say i call simple modes be as perfectly different and distinct ideas in the mind as those of the greatest distance or contrariety for the idea of two be as distinct from that of one as blueness from heat or either of them from any number and yet it be make up only of that simple idea of an unit repeat and repetitions of this kind join together make those distinct simple modes of a dozen a gross a million idea of space i shall begin with the simple idea of space i have show above chap v that we get the idea of space both by our sight and touch which i think be so evident that it would be as needle to go to prove that men perceive by their sight a distance between body of different colour or between the part of the same body as that they see colour themselves nor be it less obvious that they can do so in the dark by feel and touch space and extension this space consider barely in length between any two be without consider anything else between them be call distance if consider in length breadth and thickness i think it may be call capacity the term extension be usually apply to it in what manner soever consider immensity each different distance be a different modification of space and each idea of any different distance or space be a simple mode of this idea men for the use and by the custom of measure settle in their mind the ideas of certain state lengthssuch as be an inch foot yard fathom mile diameter of the earth c which be so many distinct ideas make up only of space when any such state lengths or measure of space be make familiar to mens thoughts they can in their mind repeat them as often as they will without mix or join to them the idea of body or anything else and frame to themselves the ideas of long square or cubic feet yards or fathom here amongst the body of the universe or else beyond the utmost bound of all body and by add these still one to another enlarge their ideas of space as much as they please the power of repeat or double any idea we have of any distance and add it to the former as often as we will without be ever able to come to any stop or stint let us enlarge it as much as we will be that which give us the idea of immensity figure there be another modification of this idea which be nothing but the relation which the part of the termination of extension or circumscribe space have amongst themselves this the touch discover in sensible body whose extremities come within our reach and the eye take both from body and colour whose boundaries be within its view where observe how the extremities terminateeither in straight line which meet at discernible angle or in crook line wherein no angle can be perceive by consider these as they relate to one another in all part of the extremities of any body or space it have that idea we call figure which afford to the mind infinite variety for besides the vast number of different figure that do really exist in the coherent mass of matter the stock that the mind have in its power by vary the idea of space and thereby make still new compositions by repeat its own ideas and join them as it please be perfectly inexhaustible and so it can multiply figure in infinitum endless variety of figure for the mind have a power to repeat the idea of any length directly stretch out and join it to another in the same direction which be to double the length of that straight line or else join another with what inclination it think fit and so make what sort of angle it please and be able also to shorten any line it imagine by take from it one half one fourth or what part it please without be able to come to an end of any such divisions it can make an angle of any bigness so also the line that be its side of what length it please which join again to other line of different lengths and at different angle till it have wholly enclose any space it be evident that it can multiply figure both in their shape and capacity in infinitum all which be but so many different simple modes of space the same that it can do with straight line it can also do with crook or crook and straight together and the same it can do in line it can also in superficies by which we may be lead into farther thoughts of the endless variety of figure that the mind have a power to make and thereby to multiply the simple modes of space place another idea come under this head and belong to this tribe be that we call place as in simple space we consider the relation of distance between any two body or point so in our idea of place we consider the relation of distance betwixt anything and any two or more point which be consider as keep the same distance one with another and so consider as at rest for when we find anything at the same distance now which it be yesterday from any two or more point which have not since change their distance one with another and with which we then compare it we say it hath keep the same place but if it hath sensibly alter its distance with either of those point we say it hath change its place though vulgarly speak in the common notion of place we do not always exactly observe the distance from these precise point but from larger portion of sensible object to which we consider the thing place to bear relation and its distance from which we have some reason to observe place relative to particular body thus a company of chessmen stand on the same square of the chess board where we leave them we say they be all in the same place or unmoved though perhaps the chessboard hath be in the mean time carry out of one room into another because we compare them only to the part of the chessboard which keep the same distance one with another the chessboard we also say be in the same place it be if it remain in the same part of the cabin though perhaps the ship which it be in sail all the while and the ship be say to be in the same place suppose it keep the same distance with the part of the neighbour land though perhaps the earth hath turn round and so both chessmen and board and ship have every one change place in respect of remoter body which have keep the same distance one with another but yet the distance from certain part of the board be that which determine the place of the chessmen and the distance from the fix part of the cabin with which we make the comparison be that which determine the place of the chessboard and the fix part of the earth that by which we determine the place of the shipthese things may be say to be in the same place in those respect though their distance from some other things which in this matter we do not consider be vary they have undoubtedly change place in that respect and we ourselves shall think so when we have occasion to compare them with those other place relative to a present purpose but this modification of distance we call place be make by men for their common use that by it they might be able to design the particular position of things where they have occasion for such designation men consider and determine of this place by reference to those adjacent things which best serve to their present purpose without consider other things which to another purpose would better determine the place of the same thing thus in the chessboard the use of the designation of the place of each chessman be determine only within that chequer piece of wood it would cross that purpose to measure it by anything else but when these very chessmen be put up in a bag if any one should ask where the black king be it would be proper to determine the place by the part of the room it be in and not by the chessboard there be another use of design the place it be now in than when in play it be on the chessboard and so must be determine by other body so if any one should ask in what place be the verse which report the story of nisus and euryalus it would be very improper to determine this place by say they be in such a part of the earth or in bodleys library but the right designation of the place would be by the part of virgils work and the proper answer would be that these verse be about the middle of the ninth book of his aeneids and that they have be always constantly in the same place ever since virgil be print which be true though the book itself hath move a thousand time the use of the idea of place here be to know in what part of the book that story be that so upon occasion we may know where to find it and have recourse to it for use place of the universe that our idea of place be nothing else but such a relative position of anything as i have before mention i think be plain and will be easily admit when we consider that we can have no idea of the place of the universe though we can of all the part of it because beyond that we have not the idea of any fix distinct particular be in reference to which we can imagine it to have any relation of distance but all beyond it be one uniform space or expansion wherein the mind find no variety no mark for to say that the world be somewhere mean no more than that it do exist this though a phrase borrow from place signify only its existence not location and when one can find out and frame in his mind clearly and distinctly the place of the universe he will be able to tell us whether it move or stand still in the undistinguishable inane of infinite space though it be true that the word place have sometimes a more confuse sense and stand for that space which anybody take up and so the universe be in a place the idea therefore of place we have by the same mean that we get the idea of space whereof this be but a particular limit consideration viz by our sight and touch by either of which we receive into our mind the ideas of extension or distance extension and body not the same there be some that would persuade us that body and extension be the same thing who either change the signification of word which i would not suspect them ofthey have so severely condemn the philosophy of others because it hath be too much place in the uncertain mean or deceitful obscurity of doubtful or insignificant term if therefore they mean by body and extension the same that other people do viz by body something that be solid and extend whose part be separable and movable different ways and by extension only the space that lie between the extremities of those solid coherent part and which be possess by themthey confound very different ideas one with another for i appeal to every man own thoughts whether the idea of space be not as distinct from that of solidity as it be from the idea of scarlet colour it be true solidity can not exist without extension neither can scarlet colour exist without extension but this hinder not but that they be distinct ideas many ideas require others as necessary to their existence or conception which yet be very distinct ideas motion can neither be nor be conceive without space and yet motion be not space nor space motion space can exist without it and they be very distinct ideas and so i think be those of space and solidity solidity be so inseparable an idea from body that upon that depend its fill of space its contact impulse and communication of motion upon impulse and if it be a reason to prove that spirit be different from body because think include not the idea of extension in it the same reason will be as valid i suppose to prove that space be not body because it include not the idea of solidity in it space and solidity be as distinct ideas as think and extension and as wholly separable in the mind one from another body then and extension it be evident be two distinct ideas for extension not solidity first extension include no solidity nor resistance to the motion of body as body do the part of space inseparable both really and mentally secondly the part of pure space be inseparable one from the other so that the continuity can not be separate neither really nor mentally for i demand of any one to remove any part of it from another with which it be continue even so much as in think to divide and separate actually be as i think by remove the part one from another to make two superficies where before there be a continuity and to divide mentally be to make in the mind two superficies where before there be a continuity and consider them as remove one from the other which can only be do in things consider by the mind as capable of be separate and by separation of acquire new distinct superficies which they then have not but be capable of but neither of these ways of separation whether real or mental be as i think compatible to pure space it be true a man may consider so much of such a space as be answerable or commensurate to a foot with out consider the rest which be indeed a partial consideration but not so much as mental separation or division since a man can no more mentally divide without consider two superficies separate one from the other than he can actually divide without make two superficies disjoin one from the other but a partial consideration be not separate a man may consider light in the sun without its heat or mobility in body without its extension without think of their separation one be only a partial consideration terminate in one alone and the other be a consideration of both as exist separately the part of space immovable thirdly the part of pure space be immovable which follow from their inseparability motion be nothing but change of distance between any two things but this can not be between part that be inseparable which therefore must need be at perpetual rest one amongst another thus the determine idea of simple space distinguish it plainly and sufficiently from body since its part be inseparable immovable and without resistance to the motion of body the definition of extension explain it not if any one ask me what this space i speak of be i will tell him when he tell me what his extension be for to say as be usually do that extension be to have part extra part be to say only that extension be extension for what be i the better inform in the nature of extension when i be tell that extension be to have part that be extend exterior to part that be extend ie extension consist of extend part as if one ask what a fibre be i should answer himthat it be a thing make up of several fibres would he thereby be enable to understand what a fibre be better than he do before or rather would he not have reason to think that my design be to make sport with him rather than seriously to instruct him division of be into body and spirit prove not space and body the same those who contend that space and body be the same bring this dilemmaeither this space be something or nothing if nothing be between two body they must necessarily touch if it be allow to be something they ask whether it be body or spirit to which i answer by another question who tell them that there be or could be nothing but solid be which could not think and think be that be not extendedwhich be all they mean by the term body and spirit substance which we know not no proof against space without body if it be demand as usually it be whether this space void of body be substance or accident i shall readily answer i know not nor shall be ashamed to own my ignorance till they that ask show me a clear distinct idea of substance different mean of substance i endeavour as much as i can to deliver myself from those fallacies which we be apt to put upon ourselves by take word for things it help not our ignorance to feign a knowledge where we have none by make a noise with sound without clear and distinct significations name make at pleasure neither alter the nature of things nor make us understand them but as they be sign of and stand for determine ideas and i desire those who lay so much stress on the sound of these two syllables substance to consider whether apply it as they do to the infinite incomprehensible god to finite spirit and to body it be in the same sense and whether it stand for the same idea when each of those three so different be be call substances if so whether it will thence followthat god spirit and body agree in the same common nature of substance differ not any otherwise than in a bare different modification of that substance as a tree and a pebble be in the same sense body and agree in the common nature of body differ only in a bare modification of that common matter which will be a very harsh doctrine if they say that they apply it to god finite spirit and matter in three different significations and that it stand for one idea when god be say to be a substance for another when the soul be call substance and for a third when body be call soif the name substance stand for three several distinct ideas they would do well to make know those distinct ideas or at least to give three distinct name to them to prevent in so important a notion the confusion and errors that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of so doubtful a term which be so far from be suspect to have three distinct that in ordinary use it have scarce one clear distinct signification and if they can thus make three distinct ideas of substance what hinder why another may not make a fourth substance and accidents of little use in philosophy they who first run into the notion of accidents as a sort of real be that need something to inhere in be force to find out the word substance to support them have the poor indian philosopher who imagine that the earth also want something to bear it up but think of this word substance he need not to have be at the trouble to find an elephant to support it and a tortoise to support his elephant the word substance would have do it effectually and he that inquire might have take it for as good an answer from an indian philosopherthat substance without know what it be be that which support the earth as we take it for a sufficient answer and good doctrine from our european philosophersthat substance without know what it be be that which support accidents so that of substance we have no idea of what it be but only a confuse obscure one of what it do stick on and underpropping whatever a learn man may do here an intelligent american who inquire into the nature of things would scarce take it for a satisfactory account if desire to learn our architecture he should be tell that a pillar be a thing support by a basis and a basis something that support a pillar would he not think himself mock instead of teach with such an account as this and a stranger to them would be very liberally instruct in the nature of book and the things they contain if he should be tell that all learn book consist of paper and letter and that letter be things inhere in paper and paper a thing that hold forth letter a notable way of have clear ideas of letter and paper but be the latin word inhaerentia and substantio put into the plain english ones that answer them and be call stick on and underpropping they would better discover to us the very great clearness there be in the doctrine of substance and accidents and show of what use they be in decide of question in philosophy a vacuum beyond the utmost bound of body but to return to our idea of space if body be not suppose infinite which i think no one will affirm i would ask whether if god place a man at the extremity of corporeal be he could not stretch his hand beyond his body if he could then he would put his arm where there be before space without body and if there he spread his finger there would still be space between them without body if he could not stretch out his hand it must be because of some external hindrance for we suppose him alive with such a power of move the part of his body that he hath now which be not in itself impossible if god so please to have it or at least it be not impossible for god so to move him and then i askwhether that which hinder his hand from move outwards be substance or accident something or nothing and when they have resolve that they will be able to resolve themselveswhat that be which be or may be between two body at a distance that be not body and have no solidity in the mean time the argument be at least as good that where nothing hinder as beyond the utmost bound of all body a body put in motion may move on as where there be nothing be tween there two body must necessarily touch for pure space between be sufficient to take away the necessity of mutual contact but bare space in the way be not sufficient to stop motion the truth be these men must either own that they think body infinite though they be loth to speak it out or else affirm that space be not body for i would fain meet with that think man that can in his thoughts set any bound to space more than he can to duration or by think hope to arrive at the end of either and therefore if his idea of eternity be infinite so be his idea of immensity they be both finite or infinite alike the power of annihilation prove a vacuum farther those who assert the impossibility of space exist without matter must not only make body infinite but must also deny a power in god to annihilate any part of matter no one i suppose will deny that god can put an end to all motion that be in matter and fix all the body of the universe in a perfect quiet and rest and continue them so long as he please whoever then will allow that god can during such a general rest annihilate either this book or the body of him that read it must necessarily admit the possibility of a vacuum for it be evident that the space that be fill by the part of the annihilate body will still remain and be a space without body for the circumambient body be in perfect rest be a wall of adamant and in that state make it a perfect impossibility for any other body to get into that space and indeed the necessary motion of one particle of matter into the place from whence another particle of matter be remove be but a consequence from the supposition of plenitude which will therefore need some better proof than a suppose matter of fact which experiment can never make out our own clear and distinct ideas plainly satisfy us that there be no necessary connexion between space and solidity since we can conceive the one without the other and those who dispute for or against a vacuum do thereby confess they have distinct ideas of vacuum and plenum ie that they have an idea of extension void of solidity though they deny its existence or else they dispute about nothing at all for they who so much alter the signification of word as to call extension body and consequently make the whole essence of body to be nothing but pure extension without solidity must talk absurdly whenever they speak of vacuum since it be impossible for extension to be without extension for vacuum whether we affirm or deny its existence signify space without body whose very existence no one can deny to be possible who will not make matter infinite and take from god a power to annihilate any particle of it motion prove a vacuum but not to go so far as beyond the utmost bound of body in the universe nor appeal to gods omnipotency to find a vacuum the motion of body that be in our view and neighbourhood seem to me plainly to evince it for i desire any one so to divide a solid body of any dimension he please as to make it possible for the solid part to move up and down freely every way within the bound of that superficies if there be not leave in it a void space as big as the least part into which he have divide the say solid body and if where the least particle of the body divide be as big as a mustardseed a void space equal to the bulk of a mustardseed be requisite to make room for the free motion of the part of the divide body within the bound of its superficies where the particles of matter be less than a mustardseed there must also be a space void of solid matter as big as part of a mustardseed for if it hold in the one it will hold in the other and so on in infinitum and let this void space be as little as it will it destroy the hypothesis of plenitude for if there can be a space void of body equal to the smallest separate particle of matter now exist in nature it be still space without body and make as great a difference between space and body as if it be mega chasma a distance as wide as any in nature and therefore if we suppose not the void space necessary to motion equal to the least parcel of the divide solid matter but to or of it the same consequence will always follow of space without matter the ideas of space and body distinct but the question be herewhether the idea of space or exten sion be the same with the idea of body it be not necessary to prove the real existence of a vacuum but the idea of it which it be plain men have when they inquire and dispute whether there be a vacuum or no for if they have not the idea of space without body they could not make a question about its existence and if their idea of body do not include in it something more than the bare idea of space they could have no doubt about the plenitude of the world and it would be as absurd to demand whether there be space without body as whether there be space without space or body without body since these be but different name of the same idea extension be inseparable from body prove it not the same it be true the idea of extension join itself so inseparably with all visible and most tangible qualities that it suffer us to see no one or feel very few external object without take in impressions of extension too this readiness of extension to make itself be take notice of so constantly with other ideas have be the occasion i guess that some have make the whole essence of body to consist in extension which be not much to be wonder at since some have have their mind by their eye and touch the busiest of all our sense so fill with the idea of extension and as it be wholly possess with it that they allow no existence to anything that have not extension i shall not now argue with those men who take the measure and possibility of all be only from their narrow and gross imaginations but have here to do only with those who conclude the essence of body to be extension because they say they can not imagine any sensible quality of any body without extensioni shall desire them to consider that have they reflect on their ideas of taste and smell as much as on those of sight and touch nay have they examine their ideas of hunger and thirst and several other pain they would have find that they include in them no idea of extension at all which be but an affection of body as well as the rest discoverable by our sense which be scarce acute enough to look into the pure essences of things essences of things if those ideas which be con stantly join to all others must therefore be conclude to be the essence of those things which have constantly those ideas join to them and be inseparable from them then unity be without doubt the essence of everything for there be not any object of sensation or reflection which do not carry with it the idea of one but the weakness of this kind of argument we have already show sufficiently ideas of space and solidity distinct to conclude whatever men shall think concern the existence of a vacuum this be plain to methat we have as clear an idea of space distinct from solidity as we have of solidity distinct from motion or motion from space we have not any two more distinct ideas and we can as easily conceive space without solidity as we can conceive body or space without motion though it be never so certain that neither body nor motion can exist without space but whether any one will take space to be only a relation result from the existence of other be at a distance or whether they will think the word of the most know king solomon the heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain thee or those more emphatical ones of the inspire philosopher st paul in him we live move and have our be be to be understand in a literal sense i leave every one to consider only our idea of space be i think such as i have mention and distinct from that of body for whether we consider in matter itself the distance of its coherent solid part and call it in respect of those solid part extension or whether consider it as lie between the extremities of any body in its several dimension we call it length breadth and thickness or else consider it as lie between any two body or positive be without any consideration whether there be any matter or not between we call it distancehowever name or consider it be always the same uniform simple idea of space take from object about which our sense have be conversant whereof have settle ideas in our mind we can revive repeat and add them one to another as often as we will and consider the space or distance so imagine either as fill with solid part so that another body can not come there without displac ing and thrust out the body that be there before or else as void of solidity so that a body of equal dimension to that empty or pure space may be place in it without the remove or expulsion of anything that be there but to avoid confusion in discourse concern this matter it be possibly to be wish that the name extension be apply only to matter or the distance of the extremities of particular body and the term expansion to space in general with or without solid matter possess itso as to say space be expand and body extend but in this every one have his liberty i propose it only for the more clear and distinct way of speak men differ little in clear simple ideas the know precisely what our word stand for would i imagine in this as well as a great many other case quickly end the dispute for i be apt to think that men when they come to examine them find their simple ideas all generally to agree though in discourse with one another they perhaps confound one another with different name i imagine that men who abstract their thoughts and do well examine the ideas of their own mind can not much differ in think however they may perplex themselves with word accord to the way of speak to the several school or sects they have be breed up in though amongst unthinking men who examine not scrupulously and carefully their own ideas and strip them not from the mark men use for them but confound them with word there must be endless dispute wrangle and jargon especially if they be learn bookish men devote to some sect and accustom to the language of it and have learn to talk after others but if it should happen that any two think men should really have different ideas i do not see how they could discourse or argue with another here i must not be mistake to think that every float imagination in mens brain be presently of that sort of ideas i speak of it be not easy for the mind to put off those confuse notions and prejudice it have imbibe from custom inadvertency and common conversation it require pain and assiduity to examine its ideas till it resolve them into those clear and distinct simple ones out of which they be compound and to see which amongst its simple ones have or have not a necessary connexion and dependence one upon another till a man doth this in the primary and original notions of things he build upon float and uncertain principles and will often find himself at a loss idea of duration and its simple modes duration be fleet extension there be another sort of distance or length the idea whereof we get not from the permanent part of space but from the fleet and perpetually perish part of succession this we call duration the simple modes whereof be any different lengths of it whereof we have distinct ideas as hours days years c time and eternity its idea from reflection on the train of our ideas the answer of a great man to one who ask what time be si non rogas intelligo which amount to this the more i set myself to think of it the less i understand it might perhaps persuade one that time which reveal all other things be itself not to be discover duration time and eternity be not without reason think to have something very abstruse in their nature but however remote these may seem from our comprehension yet if we trace them right to their originals i doubt not but one of those source of all our knowledge viz sensation and reflection will be able to furnish us with these ideas as clear and distinct as many others which be think much less obscure and we shall find that the idea of eternity itself be derive from the same common original with the rest of our ideas nature and origin of the idea of duration to understand time and eternity aright we ought with attention to consider what idea it be we have of duration and how we come by it it be evident to any one who will but observe what pass in his own mind that there be a train of ideas which constantly succeed one another in his understand as long as he be awake reflection on these appearances of several ideas one after another in our mind be that which furnish us with the idea of succession and the distance between any part of that succession or between the appearance of any two ideas in our mind be that we call duration for whilst we be think or whilst we receive successively several ideas in our mind we know that we do exist and so we call the existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves or anything else commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our mind the duration of ourselves or any such other thing coexistent with our think proof that its idea be get from reflection on the train of our ideas that we have our notion of succession and duration from this original viz from reflection on the train of ideas which we find to appear one after another in our own mind seem plain to me in that we have no perception of duration but by consider the train of ideas that take their turn in our understand when that succession of ideas cease our perception of duration cease with it which every one clearly experiment in himself whilst he sleep soundly whether an hour or a day a month or a year of which duration of things while he sleep or think not he have no perception at all but it be quite lose to him and the moment wherein he leave off to think till the moment he begin to think again seem to him to have no distance and so i doubt not it would be to a wake man if it be possible for him to keep only one idea in his mind without variation and the succession of others and we see that one who fix his thoughts very intently on one thing so as to take but little notice of the succession of ideas that pass in his mind whilst he be take up with that earnest contemplation let slip out of his account a good part of that duration and think that time shorter than it be but if sleep commonly unite the distant part of duration it be because during that time we have no succession of ideas in our mind for if a man during his sleep dream and variety of ideas make themselves perceptible in his mind one after another he hath then during such dream a sense of duration and of the length of it by which it be to me very clear that men derive their ideas of duration from their reflections on the train of the ideas they observe to succeed one another in their own understand without which observation they can have no notion of duration whatever may happen in the world the idea of duration applicable to things whilst we sleep indeed a man have from reflect on the succession and number of his own thoughts get the notion or idea of duration he can apply that notion to things which exist while he do not think as he that have get the idea of extension from body by his sight or touch can apply it to distance where no body be see or felt and therefore though a man have no perception of the length of duration which pass whilst he sleep or think not yet have observe the revolution of days and nights and find the length of their duration to be in appearance regular and constant he can upon the supposition that that revolution have proceed after the same manner whilst he be asleep or think not as it use to do at other time he can i say imagine and make allowance for the length of duration whilst he sleep but if adam and eve when they be alone in the world instead of their ordinary nights sleep have pass the whole twentyfour hours in one continue sleep the duration of that twentyfour hours have be irrecoverably lose to them and be for ever leave out of their account of time the idea of succession not from motion thus by reflect on the appear of various ideas one after another in our understand we get the notion of succession which if any one should think we do rather get from our observation of motion by our sense he will perhaps be of my mind when he consider that even motion produce in his mind an idea of succession no otherwise than as it produce there a continue train of distinguishable ideas for a man look upon a body really move perceive yet no motion at all unless that motion produce a constant train of successive ideas vg a man becalm at sea out of sight of land in a fair day may look on the sun or sea or ship a whole hour together and perceive no motion at all in either though it be certain that two and perhaps all of them have move during that time a great way but as soon as he perceive either of them to have change distance with some other body as soon as this motion produce any new idea in him then he perceive that there have be motion but wherever a man be with all things at rest about him without perceive any motion at allif during this hour of quiet he have be think he will perceive the various ideas of his own thoughts in his own mind appear one after another and thereby observe and find succession where he could observe no motion very slow motion unperceived and this i think be the reason why motion very slow though they be constant be not perceive by us because in their remove from one sensible part towards another their change of distance be so slow that it cause no new ideas in us but a good while one after another and so not cause a constant train of new ideas to follow one another immediately in our mind we have no perception of motion which consist in a constant succession we can not perceive that succession without a constant succession of vary ideas arise from it very swift motion unperceived on the contrary things that move so swift as not to affect the sense distinctly with several distinguishable distance of their motion and so cause not any train of ideas in the mind be not also perceive for anything that move round about in a circle in less time than our ideas be wont to succeed one another in our mind be not perceive to move but seem to be a perfect entire circle of that matter or colour and not a part of a circle in motion the train of ideas have a certain degree of quickness hence i leave it to others to judge whether it be not probable that our ideas do whilst we be awake succeed one another in our mind at certain distance not much unlike the image in the inside of a lantern turn round by the heat of a candle this appearance of theirs in train though perhaps it may be sometimes faster and sometimes slower yet i guess vary not very much in a wake man there seem to be certain bound to the quickness and slowness of the succession of those ideas one to another in our mind beyond which they can neither delay nor hasten real succession in swift motion without sense of succession the reason i have for this odd conjecture be from observe that in the impressions make upon any of our sense we can but to a certain degree perceive any succession which if exceed quick the sense of succession be lose even in case where it be evident that there be a real succession let a cannonbullet pass through a room and in its way take with it any limb or fleshy part of a man it be as clear as any demonstration can be that it must strike successively the two side of the room it be also evident that it must touch one part of the flesh first and another after and so in succession and yet i believe nobody who ever felt the pain of such a shoot or hear the blow against the two distant wall could perceive any succession either in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke such a part of duration as this wherein we perceive no succession be that which we call an instant and be that which take up the time of only one idea in our mind without the succession of another wherein therefore we perceive no succession at all in slow motion this also happen where the motion be so slow as not to supply a constant train of fresh ideas to the sense as fast as the mind be capable of receive new ones into it and so other ideas of our own thoughts have room to come into our mind between those offer to our sense by the move body there the sense of motion be lose and the body though it really move yet not change perceivable distance with some other body as fast as the ideas of our own mind do naturally follow one another in train the thing seem to stand still as be evident in the hand of clock and shadow of sundials and other constant but slow motion where though after certain intervals we perceive by the change of distance that it hath move yet the motion itself we perceive not this train the measure of other successions so that to me it seem that the constant and regular succession of ideas in a wake man be as it be the measure and standard of all other successions whereof if any one either exceed the pace of our ideas as where two sound or pain c take up in their succession the duration of but one idea or else where any motion or succession be so slow as that it keep not pace with the ideas in our mind or the quickness in which they take their turn as when any one or more ideas in their ordinary course come into our mind between those which be offer to the sight by the different perceptible distance of a body in motion or between sound or smell follow one anotherthere also the sense of a constant continue succession be lose and we perceive it not but with certain gap of rest between the mind can not fix long on one invariable idea if it be so that the ideas of our mind whilst we have any there do constantly change and shift in a continual succession it would be impossible may any one say for a man to think long of any one thing by which if it be mean that a man may have one selfsame single idea a long time alone in his mind without any variation at all i think in matter of fact it be not possible for which not know how the ideas of our mind be frame of what materials they be make whence they have their light and how they come to make their appearances i can give no other reason but experience and i would have any one try whether he can keep one unvaried single idea in his mind without any other for any considerable time together proof for trial let him take any figure any degree of light or whiten or what other he please and he will i suppose find it difficult to keep all other ideas out of his mind but that some either of another kind or various considerations of that idea each of which considerations be a new idea will constantly succeed one another in his thoughts let him be as wary as he can the extent of our power over the succession of our ideas all that be in a man power in this case i think be only to mind and observe what the ideas be that take their turn in his understand or else to direct the sort and call in such as he hath a desire or use of but hinder the constant succession of fresh ones i think he can not though he may commonly choose whether he will heedfully observe and consider them ideas however make include no sense of motion whether these several ideas in a man mind be make by certain motion i will not here dispute but this i be sure that they include no idea of motion in their appearance and if a man have not the idea of motion otherwise i think he would have none at all which be enough to my present purpose and sufficiently show that the notice we take of the ideas of our own mind appear there one after another be that which give us the idea of succession and duration without which we should have no such ideas at all it be not then motion but the constant train of ideas in our mind whilst we be wake that furnish us with the idea of duration whereof motion no otherwise give us any perception than as it cause in our mind a constant succession of ideas as i have before show and we have as clear an idea of succession and duration by the train of other ideas succeed one another in our mind without the idea of any motion as by the train of ideas cause by the uninterrupted sensible change of distance between two body which we have from motion and therefore we should as well have the idea of duration be there no sense of motion at all time be duration set out by measure have thus get the idea of duration the next thing natural for the mind to do be to get some measure of this common duration whereby it might judge of its different lengths and consider the distinct order wherein several things exist without which a great part of our knowledge would be confuse and a great part of history be render very useless this consideration of duration as set out by certain periods and mark by certain measure or epochs be that i think which most properly we call time a good measure of time must divide its whole duration into equal periods in the measure of extension there be nothing more require but the application of the standard or measure we make use of to the thing of whose extension we would be inform but in the measure of duration this can not be do because no two different part of succession can be put together to measure one another and nothing be a measure of duration but duration as nothing be of extension but extension we can not keep by us any stand unvarying measure of duration which consist in a constant fleet succession as we can of certain lengths of extension as inch feet yards c mark out in permanent parcel of matter nothing then could serve well for a convenient measure of time but what have divide the whole length of its duration into apparently equal portion by constantly repeat periods what portion of duration be not distinguish or consider as distinguish and measure by such periods come not so properly under the notion of time as appear by such phrase as these viz before all time and when time shall be no more the revolutions of the sun and moon the properest measure of time for mankind the diurnal and annual revolutions of the sun as have be from the begin of nature constant regular and universally observable by all mankind and suppose equal to one another have be with reason make use of for the measure of duration but the distinction of days and years have depend on the motion of the sun it have bring this mistake with it that it have be think that motion and duration be the measure one of another for men in the measure of the length of time have be accustom to the ideas of minutes hours days months years c which they find themselves upon any mention of time or duration presently to think on all which portion of time be measure out by the motion of those heavenly body they be apt to confound time and motion or at least to think that they have a nece ssary connexionone with another whereas any constant periodical appearance or alteration of ideas in seemingly equidistant space of duration if constant and universally observable would have as well distinguish the intervals of time as those that have be make use of for suppose the sun which some have take to be a fire have be light up at the same distance of time that it now every day come about to the same meridian and then go out again about twelve hours after and that in the space of an annual revolution it have sensibly increase in brightness and heat and so decrease againwould not such regular appearances serve to measure out the distance of duration to all that could observe it as well without as with motion for if the appearances be constant universally observable in equidistant periods they would serve mankind for measure of time as well be the motion away but not by their motion but periodical appearances for the freeze of water or the blow of a plant return at equidistant periods in all part of the earth would as well serve men to reckon their years by as the motion of the sun and in effect we see that some people in america count their years by the come of certain bird amongst them at their certain season and leave them at others for a fit of an ague the sense of hunger or thirst a smell or a taste or any other idea return constantly at equidistant periods and make itself universally be take notice of would not fail to measure out the course of succession and distinguish the distance of time thus we see that men bear blind count time well enough by years whose revolutions yet they can not distinguish by motion that they perceive not and i ask whether a blind man who distinguish his years either by the heat of summer or cold of winter by the smell of any flower of the spring or taste of any fruit of the autumn would not have a better measure of time than the romans have before the reformation of their calendar by julius caesar or many other people whose years notwithstanding the motion of the sun which they pretend to make use of be very irregular and it add no small difficulty to chronology that the exact lengths of the years that several nations count by be hard to be know they differ very much one from another and i think i may say all of them from the precise motion of the sun and if the sun move from the creation to the flood constantly in the equator and so equally disperse its light and heat to all the habitable part of the earth in days all of the same length without its annual variations to the tropics as a late ingenious author suppose i do not think it very easy to imagine that notwithstanding the motion of the sun men should in the antediluvian world from the begin count by years or measure their time by periods that have no sensible mark very obvious to distinguish them by no two part of duration can be certainly know to be equal but perhaps it will be saidwithout a regular motion such as of the sun or some other how could it ever be know that such periods be equal to which i answerthe equality of any other return appearances might be know by the same way that that of days be know or presume to be so at first which be only by judge of them by the train of ideas which have pass in mens mind in the intervals by which train of ideas discover inequality in the natural days but none in the artificial days the artificial days or nuchtheerha be guess to be equal which be sufficient to make them serve for a measure though exacter search have since discover inequality in the diurnal revolutions of the sun and we know not whether the annual also be not unequal these yet by their presume and apparent equality serve as well to reckon time by though not to measure the part of duration exactly as if they could be prove to be exactly equal we must therefore carefully distinguish betwixt duration itself and the measure we make use of to judge of its length duration in itself be to be consider as go on in one constant equal uniform course but none of the measure of it which we make use of can be know to do so nor can we be assure that their assign part or periods be equal in duration one to another for two successive lengths of duration however measure can never be demonstrate to be equal the motion of the sun which the world use so long and so confidently for an exact measure of duration have as i say be find in its several part unequal and though men have of late make use of a pendulum as a more steady and regular motion than that of the sun or to speak more truly of the earthyet if any one should be ask how he certainly know that the two successive swing of a pendulum be equal it would be very hard to satisfy him that they be infallibly so since we can not be sure that the cause of that motion which be unknown to us shall always operate equally and we be sure that the medium in which the pendulum move be not constantly the same either of which vary may alter the equality of such periods and thereby destroy the certainty and exactness of the measure by motion as well as any other periods of other appearances the notion of duration still remain clear though our measure of it can not any of them be demonstrate to be exact since then no two portion of succession can be bring together it be impossible ever certainly to know their equality all that we can do for a measure of time be to take such as have continual successive appearances at seemingly equidistant periods of which seem equality we have no other measure but such as the train of our own ideas have lodge in our memories with the concurrence of other probable reason to persuade us of their equality time not the measure of motion one thing seem strange to methat whilst all men manifestly measure time by the motion of the great and visible body of the world time yet should be define to be the measure of motion whereas it be obvious to every one who reflect ever so little on it that to measure motion space be as necessary to be consider as time and those who look a little farther will find also the bulk of the thing move necessary to be take into the computation by any one who will estimate or measure motion so as to judge right of it nor indeed do motion any otherwise conduce to the measure of duration than as it constantly bring about the return of certain sensible ideas in seem equidistant periods for if the motion of the sun be as unequal as of a ship drive by unsteady wind sometimes very slow and at others irregularly very swift or if be constantly equally swift it yet be not circular and produce not the same appearancesit would not at all help us to measure time any more than the seem unequal motion of a comet do minutes hours days and years not necessary measure of duration minutes hours days and years be then no more necessary to time or duration than inch feet yards and miles mark out in any matter be to extension for though we in this part of the universe by the constant use of them as of periods set out by the revolutions of the sun or as know part of such periods have fix the ideas of such lengths of duration in our mind which we apply to all part of time whose lengths we would consider yet there may be other part of the universe where they no more use there measure of ours than in japan they do our inch feet or miles but yet something analogous to them there must be for without some regular periodical return we could not measure ourselves or signify to others the length of any duration though at the same time the world be as full of motion as it be now but no part of it dispose into regular and apparently equidistant revolutions but the different measure that may be make use of for the account of time do not at all alter the notion of duration which be the thing to be measure no more than the different standards of a foot and a cubit alter the notion of extension to those who make use of those different measure our measure of time applicable to duration before time the mind have once get such a measure of time as the annual revolution of the sun can apply that measure to duration wherein that measure itself do not exist and with which in the reality of its be it have nothing to do for should one say that abraham be bear in the two thousand seven hundred and twelfth year of the julian period it be altogether as intelligible as reckon from the begin of the world though there be so far back no motion of the sun nor any motion at all for though the julian period be suppose to begin several hundred years before there be really either days nights or years mark out by any revolutions of the sunyet we reckon as right and thereby measure durations as well as if really at that time the sun have exist and keep the same ordinary motion it doth now the idea of duration equal to an annual revolution of the sun be as easily applicable in our thoughts to duration where no sun or motion be as the idea of a foot or yard take from body here can be apply in our thoughts to duration where no sun or motion be as the idea of a foot or yard take from body here can be apply in our thoughts to distance beyond the confine of the world where be no body at all as we can measure space in our thoughts where there be no body for suppose it be miles or millions of miles from this place to the remotest body of the universe for be finite it must be at a certain distance as we suppose it to be years from this time to the first existence of any body in the begin of the worldwe can in our thoughts apply this measure of a year to duration before the creation or beyond the duration of body or motion as we can this measure of a mile to space beyond the utmost body and by the one measure duration where there be no motion as well as by the other measure space in our thoughts where there be no body the assumption that the world be neither boundless nor eternal if it be object to me here that in this way of explain of time i have beg what i should not viz that the world be neither eternal nor infinite i answer that to my present purpose it be not needful in this place to make use of arguments to evince the world to be finite both in duration and extension but it be at least as conceivable as the contrary i have certainly the liberty to suppose it as well as any one hath to suppose the contrary and i doubt not but that every one that will go about it may easily conceive in his mind the begin of motion though not of all duration and so may come to a step and non ultra in his consideration of motion so also in his thoughts he may set limit to body and the extension belong to it but not to space where no body be the utmost bound of space and duration be beyond the reach of think as well as the utmost bound of number be beyond the largest comprehension of the mind and all for the same reason as we shall see in another place eternity by the same mean therefore and from the same original that we come to have the idea of time we have also that idea which we call eternity viz have get the idea of succession and duration by reflect on the train of our own ideas cause in us either by the natural appearances of those ideas come constantly of themselves into our wake thoughts or else cause by external object successively affect our sense and have from the revolutions of the sun get the ideas of certain lengths of durationwe can in our thoughts add such lengths of duration to one another as often as we please and apply them so add to durations past or to come and this we can continue to do on without bound or limit and proceed in infinitum and apply thus the length of the annual motion of the sun to duration suppose before the sun or any other motion have its be which be no more difficult or absurd than to apply the notion i have of the move of a shadow one hour today upon the sundial to the duration of something last night vg the burn of a candle which be now absolutely separate from all actual motion and it be as impossible for the duration of that flame for an hour last night to coexist with any motion that now be or for ever shall be as for any part of duration that be before the begin of the world to coexist with the motion of the sun now but yet this hinder not but that have the idea of the length of the motion of the shadow on a dial between the mark of two hours i can as distinctly measure in my thoughts the duration of that candlelight last night as i can the duration of anything that do now exist and it be no more than to think that have the sun shine then on the dial and move after the same rate it doth now the shadow on the dial would have pass from one hourline to another whilst that flame of the candle last our measure of duration dependent on our ideas the notion of an hour day or year be only the idea i have of the length of certain periodical regular motion neither of which motion do ever all at once exist but only in the ideas i have of them in my memory derive from my sense or reflection i can with the same ease and for the same reason apply it in my thoughts to duration antecedent to all manner of motion as well as to anything that be but a minute or a day antecedent to the motion that at this very moment the sun be in all things past be equally and perfectly at rest and to this way of consideration of them be all one whether they be before the begin of the world or but yesterday the measure of any duration by some motion depend not at all on the real coexistence of that thing to that motion or any other periods of revolution but the have a clear idea of the length of some periodical know motion or other in terval of duration in my mind and apply that to the duration of the thing i would measure the duration of anything need not be coexistent with the motion we measure it by hence we see that some men imagine the duration of the world from its first existence to this present year to have be years or equal to annual revolutions of the sun and others a great deal more as the egyptians of old who in the time of alexander count years from the reign of the sun and the chinese now who account the world years old or more which longer duration of the world accord to their computation though i should not believe to be true yet i can equally imagine it with them and as truly understand and say one be longer than the other as i understand that methusalems life be longer than enochs and if the common reckon of should be true as it may be as well as any other assign it hinder not at all my imagine what others mean when they make the world one thousand years older since every one may with the same facility imagine i do not say believe the world to be years old as and may as well conceive the duration of years as whereby it appear that to the measure the duration of anything by time it be not requisite that that thing should be coexistent to the motion we measure by or any other periodical revolution but it suffice to this purpose that we have the idea of the length of any regular periodical appearances which we can in our mind apply to duration with which the motion or appearance never coexist infinity in duration for as in the history of the creation deliver by moses i can imagine that light exist three days before the sun be or have any motion barely by think that the duration of light before the sun be create be so long as if the sun have move then as it doth now would have be equal to three of his diurnal revolutions so by the same way i can have an idea of the chaos or angels be create before there be either light or any continue motion a minute an hour a day a year or one thousand years for if i can but consider duration equal to one minute before either the be or motion of any body i can add one minute more till i come to sixty and by the same way of add minutes hours or years ie such or such part of the sun revolutions or any other period whereof i have the idea proceed in infinitum and suppose a duration exceed as many such periods as i can reckon let me add whilst i will which i think be the notion we have of eternity of whose infinity we have no other notion than we have of the infinity of number to which we can add for ever without end origin of our ideas of duration and of the measure of it and thus i think it be plain that from those two fountains of all knowledge before mention viz reflection and sensation we get the ideas of duration and the measure of it for first by observe what pass in our mind how our ideas there in train constantly some vanish and others begin to appear we come by the idea of succession secondly by observe a distance in the part of this succession we get the idea of duration thirdly by sensation observe certain appearances at certain regular and seem equidistant periods we get the ideas of certain lengths or measure of duration as minutes hours days years c fourthly by be able to repeat those measure of time or ideas of state length of duration in our mind as often as we will we can come to imagine duration where nothing do really endure or exist and thus we imagine tomorrow next year or seven years hence fifthly by be able to repeat ideas of any length of time as of a minute a year or an age as often as we will in our own thoughts and add them one to another without ever come to the end of such addition any nearer than we can to the end of number to which we can always add we come by the idea of eternity as the future eternal duration of our souls as well as the eternity of that infinite be which must necessarily have always exist sixthly by consider any part of infinite duration as set out by periodical measure we come by the idea of what we call time in general ideas of duration and expansion consider together both capable of greater and less though we have in the precedent chapters dwell pretty long on the considerations of space and duration yet they be ideas of general concernment that have something very abstruse and peculiar in their nature the compare them one with another may perhaps be of use for their illustration and we may have the more clear and distinct conception of them by take a view of them together distance or space in its simple abstract conception to avoid confusion i call expansion to distinguish it from extension which by some be use to express this distance only as it be in the solid part of matter and so include or at least intimate the idea of body whereas the idea of pure distance include no such thing i prefer also the word expansion to space because space be often apply to distance of fleet successive part which never exist together as well as to those which be permanent in both these viz expansion and duration the mind have this common idea of continue lengths capable of greater or less quantities for a man have as clear an idea of the difference of the length of an hour and a day as of an inch and a foot expansion not bound by matter the mind have get the idea of the length of any part of expansion let it be a span or a pace or what length you will can as have be say repeat that idea and so add it to the former enlarge its idea of length and make it equal to two span or two pace and so as often as it will till it equal the distance of any part of the earth one from another and increase thus till it amount to the distance of the sun or remotest star by such a progression as this set out from the place where it be or any other place it can proceed and pass beyond all those lengths and find nothing to stop its go on either in or without body it be true we can easily in our thoughts come to the end of solid extension the extremity and bound of all body we have no difficulty to arrive at but when the mind be there it find nothing to hinder its progress into this endless expansion of that it can neither find nor conceive any end nor let any one say that beyond the bound of body there be nothing at all unless he will confine god within the limit of matter solomon whose understand be fill and enlarge with wisdom seem to have other thoughts when he say heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain thee and he i think very much magnify to himself the capacity of his own understand who persuade himself that he can extend his thoughts further than god exist or imagine any expansion where he be not nor duration by motion just so be it in duration the mind have get the idea of any length of duration can double multiply and enlarge it not only beyond its own but beyond the existence of all corporeal be and all the measure of time take from the great body of all the world and their motion but yet every one easily admit that though we make duration boundless as certainly it be we can not yet extend it beyond all be god every one easily allow fill eternity and it be hard to find a reason why any one should doubt that he likewise fill immensity his infinite be be certainly as boundless one way as another and methinks it ascribe a little too much to matter to say where there be no body there be nothing why men more easily admit infinite duration than infinite expansion hence i think we may learn the reason why every one familiarly and without the least hesitation speak of and suppose eternity and stick not to ascribe infinity to duration but it be with more doubt and reserve that many admit or suppose the infinity of space the reason whereof seem to me to be this that duration and extension be use as name of affections belong to other be we easily conceive in god infinite duration and we can not avoid do so but not attribute to him extension but only to matter which be finite we be apter to doubt of the existence of expansion without matter of which alone we commonly suppose it an attribute and therefore when men pursue their thoughts of space they be apt to stop at the confine of body as if space be there at an end too and reach no further or if their ideas upon consideration carry them further yet they term what be beyond the limit of the universe imaginary space as if it be nothing because there be no body exist in it whereas duration antecedent to all body and to the motion which it be measure by they never term imaginary because it be never suppose void of some other real existence and if the name of things may at all direct our thoughts towards the original of mens ideas as i be apt to think they may very much one may have occasion to think by the name duration that the continuation of existence with a kind of resistance to any destructive force and the continuation of solidity which be apt to be confound with and if we will look into the minute anatomical part of matter be little different from hardness be think to have some analogy and give occasion to word so near of kin as durare and durum esse and that durare be apply to the idea of hardness as well as that of existence we see in horace epod xvi ferro duravit secula but be that as it will this be certain that whoever pursue his own thoughts will find them sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body into the infinity of space or expansion the idea whereof be distinct and separate from body and all other things which may to those who please be a subject of further meditation time to duration be as place to expansion time in general be to duration as place to expansion they be so much of those boundless oceans of eternity and immensity as be set out and distinguish from the rest as it be by landmarks and so be make use of to denote the position of finite real be in respect one to another in those uniform infinite oceans of duration and space these rightly consider be only ideas of determinate distance from certain know point fix in distinguishable sensible things and suppose to keep the same distance one from another from such point fix in sensible be we reckon and from them we measure our portion of those infinite quantities which so consider be that which we call time and place for duration and space be in themselves uniform and boundless the order and position of things without such know settle point would be lose in them and all things would lie jumble in an incurable confusion time and place be take for so much of either as be set out by the existence and motion of body time and place take thus for determinate distinguishable portion of those infinite aby of space and duration set out or suppose to be distinguish from the rest by mark and know boundaries have each of them a twofold acceptation first time in general be commonly take for so much of infinite duration as be measure by and coexistent with the existence and motion of the great body of the universe as far as we know anything of them and in this sense time begin and end with the frame of this sensible world as in these phrase before mention before all time or when time shall be no more place likewise be take sometimes for that portion of infinite space which be possess by and comprehend within the material world and be thereby distinguish from the rest of expansion though this may be more properly call extension than place within these two be confine and by the observable part of them be measure and determine the particular time or duration and the particular extension and place of all corporeal be sometimes for so much of either as we design by measure take from the bulk or motion of body secondly sometimes the word time be use in a larger sense and be apply to part of that infinite duration not that be really distinguish and measure out by this real existence and periodical motion of body that be appoint from the begin to be for sign and for season and for days and years and be accordingly our measure of time but such other portion too of that infinite uniform duration which we upon any occasion do suppose equal to certain lengths of measure time and so consider them as bound and determine for if we should suppose the creation or fall of the angels be at the begin of the julian period we should speak properly enough and should be understand if we say it be a longer time since the creation of angels than the creation of the world by years whereby we would mark out so much of that undistinguished duration as we suppose equal to and would have admit annual revolutions of the sun move at the rate it now do and thus likewise we sometimes speak of place distance or bulk in the great inane beyond the confine of the world when we consider so much of that space as be equal to or capable to receive a body of any assign dimension as a cubic foot or do suppose a point in it at such a certain distance from any part of the universe they belong to all finite be where and when be question belong to all finite existences and be by us always reckon from some know part of this sensible world and from some certain epochs mark out to us by the motion observable in it without some such fix part or periods the order of things would be lose to our finite understand in the boundless invariable oceans of duration and expansion which comprehend in them all finite be and in their full extent belong only to the deity and therefore we be not to wonder that we comprehend them not and do so often find our thoughts at a loss when we would consider them either abstractly in themselves or as any way attribute to the first incomprehensible be but when apply to any particular finite be the extension of any body be so much of that infinite space as the bulk of the body take up and place be the position of any body when consider at a certain distance from some other as the idea of the particular duration of anything be an idea of that portion of infinite duration which pass during the existence of that thing so the time when the thing exist be the idea of that space of duration which pass between some know and fix period of duration and the be of that thing one show the distance of the extremities of the bulk or existence of the same thing as that it be a foot square or last two years the other show the distance of it in place or existence from other fix point of space or duration as that it be in the middle of lincolns inn field or the first degree of taurus and in the year of our lord or the th year of the julian period all which distance we measure by preconceive ideas of certain lengths of space and durationas inch feet miles and degrees and in the other minutes days and years c all the part of extension be extension and all the part of duration be duration there be one thing more wherein space and duration have a great conformity and that be though they be justly reckon amongst our simple ideas yet none of the distinct ideas we have of either be without all manner of composition it be the very nature of both of them to consist of part but their part be all of the same kind and without the mixture of any other idea hinder them not from have a place amongst simple ideas could the mind as in number come to so small a part of extension or duration as exclude divisibility that would be as it be the indivisible unit or idea by repetition of which it would make its more enlarge ideas of extension and duration but since the mind be not able to frame an idea of any space without part instead thereof it make use of the common measure which by familiar use in each country have imprint themselves on the memory as inch and feet or cubits and parasangs and so second minutes hours days and years in durationthe mind make use i say of such ideas as these as simple ones and these be the component part of larger ideas which the mind upon occasion make by the addition of such know lengths which it be acquaint with on the other side the ordinary smallest measure we have of either be look on as an unit in number when the mind by division would reduce them into less fraction though on both side both in addition and division either of space or duration when the idea under consideration become very big or very small its precise bulk become very obscure and confuse and it be the number of its repeat additions or divisions that alone remain clear and distinct as will easily appear to any one who will let his thoughts loose in the vast expansion of space or divisibility of matter every part of duration be duration too and every part of extension be extension both of them capable of addition or division in infinitum but the least portion of either of them whereof we have clear and distinct ideas may perhaps be fittest to be consider by us as the simple ideas of that kind out of which our complex modes of space extension and duration be make up and into which they can again be distinctly resolve such a small part in duration may be call a moment and be the time of one idea in our mind in the train of their ordinary succession there the other want a proper name i know not whether i may be allow to call a sensible point mean thereby the least particle of matter or space we can discern which be ordinarily about a minute and to the sharpest eye seldom less than thirty second of a circle whereof the eye be the centre their part inseparable expansion and duration have this further agreement that though they be both consider by us as have part yet their part be not separable one from another no not even in think though the part of body from whence we take our measure of the one and the part of motion or rather the succession of ideas in our mind from whence we take the measure of the other may be interrupt and separate as the one be often by rest and the other be by sleep which we call rest too duration be as a line expansion as a solid but there be this manifest difference between themthat the ideas of length which we have of expansion be turn every way and so make figure and breadth and thickness but duration be but as it be the length of one straight line extend in infinitum not capable of multiplicity variation or figure but be one common measure of all existence whatsoever wherein all things whilst they exist equally partake for this present moment be common to all things that be now in be and equally comprehend that part of their existence as much as if they be all but one single be and we may truly say they all exist in the same moment of time whether angels and spirit have any analogy to this in respect to expansion be beyond my comprehension and perhaps for us who have understand and comprehensions suit to our own preservation and the end of our own be but not to the reality and extent of all other be it be near as hard to conceive any existence or to have an idea of any real be with a perfect negation of all manner of expansion as it be to have the idea of any real existence with a perfect negation of all manner of duration and therefore what spirit have to do with space or how they communicate in it we know not all that we know be that body do each singly possess its proper portion of it accord to the extent of solid part and thereby exclude all other body from have any share in that particular portion of space whilst it remain there duration have never two part together expansion altogether duration and time which be a part of it be the idea we have of perish distance of which no two part exist together but follow each other in succession an expansion be the idea of last distance all whose part exist together and be not capable of succession and therefore though we can not conceive any duration without succession nor can put it together in our thoughts that any be do now exist tomorrow or possess at once more than the present moment of duration yet we can conceive the eternal duration of the almighty far different from that of man or any other finite be because man comprehend not in his knowledge or power all past and future things his thoughts be but of yesterday and he know not what tomorrow will bring forth what be once past he can never recall and what be yet to come he can not make present what i say of man i say of all finite be who though they may far exceed man in knowledge and power yet be no more than the meanest creature in comparison with god himself finite or any magnitude hold not any proportion to infinite gods infinite duration be accompany with infinite knowledge and infinite power he see all things past and to come and they be no more distant from his knowledge no further remove from his sight than the present they all lie under the same view and there be nothing which he can not make exist each moment he please for the existence of all things depend upon his good pleasure all things exist every moment that he think fit to have them exist to conclude expansion and duration do mutually embrace and comprehend each other every part of space be in every part of duration and every part of duration in every part of expansion such a com bination of two distinct ideas be i suppose scarce to be find in all that great variety we do or can conceive and may afford matter to further speculation idea of number number the simplest and most universal idea amongst all the ideas we have as there be none suggest to the mind by more ways so there be none more simple than that of unity or one it have no shadow of variety or composition in it every object our sense be employ about every idea in our understand every think of our mind bring this idea along with it and therefore it be the most intimate to our thoughts as well as it be in its agreement to all other things the most universal idea we have for number apply itself to men angels action thoughts everything that either doth exist or can be imagine its modes make by addition by repeat this idea in our mind and add the repetitions together we come by the complex ideas of the modes of it thus by add one to one we have the complex idea of a couple by put twelve units together we have the complex idea of a dozen and so of a score or a million or any other number each mode distinct the simple modes of number be of all other the most distinct every the least variation which be an unit make each combination as clearly different from that which approacheth nearest to it as the most remote two be as distinct from one as two hundred and the idea of two as distinct from the idea of three as the magnitude of the whole earth be from that of a mite this be not so in other simple modes in which it be not so easy nor perhaps possible for us to distinguish betwixt two approach ideas which yet be really different for who will undertake to find a difference between the white of this paper and that of the next degree to it or can form distinct ideas of every the least excess in extension therefore demonstrations in number the most precise the clearness and distinctness of each mode of number from all others even those that approach nearest make me apt to think that demonstrations in number if they be not more evident and exact than in extension yet they be more general in their use and more determinate in their application because the ideas of number be more precise and distinguishable than in extension where every equality and excess be not so easy to be observe or measure because our thoughts can not in space arrive at any determine smallness beyond which it can not go as an unit and therefore the quantity or proportion of any the least excess can not be discover which be clear otherwise in number where as have be say be as distinguishable from go as from though be the next immediate excess to but it be not so in extension where whatsoever be more than just a foot or an inch be not distinguishable from the standard of a foot or an inch and in line which appear of an equal length one may be longer than the other by innumerable part nor can any one assign an angle which shall be the next biggest to a right one name necessary to number by the repeat as have be say the idea of an unit and join it to another unit we make thereof one collective idea mark by the name two and whosoever can do this and proceed on still add one more to the last collective idea which he have of any number and give a name to it may count or have ideas for several collections of units distinguish one from another as far as he hath a series of name for follow number and a memory to retain that series with their several name all numeration be but still the add of one unit more and give to the whole together as comprehend in one idea a new or distinct name or sign whereby to know it from those before and after and distinguish it from every smaller or greater multitude of units so that he that can add one to one and so to two and so go on with his tale take still with him the distinct name belong to every progression and so again by subtract an unit from each collection retreat and lessen them be capable of all the ideas of number within the compass of his language or for which he hath name though not perhaps of more for the several simple modes of number be in our mind but so many combinations of units which have no variety nor be capable of any other difference but more or less name or mark for each distinct combination seem more necessary than in any other sort of ideas for without such name or mark we can hardly well make use of number in reckon especially where the combination be make up of any great multitude of units which put together without a name or mark to distinguish that precise collection will hardly be keep from be a heap in confusion another reason for the necessity of name to number this i think to be the reason why some americans i have speak with who be otherwise of quick and rational part enough could not as we do by any mean count to nor have any distinct idea of that number though they could reckon very well to because their language be scanty and accommodate only to the few necessaries of a needy simple life unacquainted either with trade or mathematics have no word in it to stand for so that when they be discourse with of those greater number they would show the hairs of their head to express a great multitude which they could not number which inability i suppose proceed from their want of name the tououpinambos have no name for number above any number beyond that they make out by show their finger and the finger of others who be present and i doubt not but we ourselves might distinctly number in word a great deal further than we usually do would we find out but some fit denominations to signify them by whereas in the way we take now to name them by millions of millions of millions c it be hard to go beyond eighteen or at most four and twenty decimal progressions without confusion but to show how much distinct name conduce to our well reckon or have useful ideas of number let us see all these follow figure in one continue line as the mark of one number v g nonillions octillions septillions sextillions quintrillions quartrillions trillions billions millions units the ordinary way of name this number in english will be the often repeat of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions which be the denomination of the second six figure in which way it will be very hard to have any distinguish notions of this number but whether by give every six figure a new and orderly denomination these and perhaps a great many more figure in progression might not easily be count distinctly and ideas of them both get more easily to ourselves and more plainly signify to others i leave it to be consider this i mention only to show how necessary distinct name be to number without pretend to introduce new ones of my invention why children number not earlier thus children either for want of name to mark the several progressions of number or not have yet the faculty to collect scatter ideas into complex ones and range them in a regular order and so retain them in their memories as be necessary to reckon do not begin to number very early nor proceed in it very far or steadily till a good while after they be well furnish with good store of other ideas and one may often observe them discourse and reason pretty well and have very clear conceptions of several other things before they can tell twenty and some through the default of their memories who can not retain the several combinations of number with their name annex in their distinct order and the dependence of so long a train of numeral progressions and their relation one to another be not able all their lifetime to reckon or regularly go over any moderate series of number for he that will count twenty or have any idea of that number must know that nineteen go before with the distinct name or sign of every one of them as they stand mark in their order for wherever this fail a gap be make the chain break and the progress in number can go no further so that to reckon right it be require that the mind distinguish carefully two ideas which be different one from another only by the addition or subtraction of one unit that it retain in memory the name or mark of the several combinations from an unit to that number and that not confusedly and at random but in that exact order that the number follow one another in either of which if it trip the whole business of number will be disturb and there will remain only the confuse idea of multitude but the ideas necessary to distinct numeration will not be attain to number measure all measureables this further be observable in number that it be that which the mind make use of in measure all things that by us be measurable which principally be expansion and duration and our idea of infinity even when apply to those seem to be nothing but the infinity of number for what else be our ideas of eternity and immensity but the repeat additions of certain ideas of imagine part of duration and expansion with the infinity of number in which we can come to no end of addition for such an inexhaustible stock number of all other our ideas most clearly furnish us with as be obvious to every one for let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he please this multitude how great soever lessen not one jot the power of add to it or bring him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number where still there remain as much to be add as if none be take out and this endless addition or addibility if any one like the word better of number so apparent to the mind be that i think which give us the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity of which more in the follow chapter of infinity infinity in its original intention attribute to space duration and number he that would know what kind of idea it be to which we give the name of infinity can not do it better than by consider to what infinity be by the mind more immediately attribute and then how the mind come to frame it finite and infinite seem to me to be look upon by the mind as the modes of quantity and to be attribute primarily in their first designation only to those things which have part and be capable of increase or diminution by the addition or subtraction of any the least part and such be the ideas of space duration and number which we have consider in the forego chapters it be true that we can not but be assure that the great god of whom and from whom be all things be incomprehensibly infinite but yet when we apply to that first and supreme be our idea of infinite in our weak and narrow thoughts we do it primarily in respect to his duration and ubiquity and i think more figuratively to his power wisdom and goodness and other attribute which be properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible c for when we call them infinite we have no other idea of this infinity but what carry with it some reflection on and imitation of that number or extent of the act or object of gods power wisdom and goodness which can never be suppose so great or so many which these attribute will not always surmount and exceed let us multiply them in our thoughts as far as we can with all the infinity of endless number i do not pretend to say how these attribute be in god who be infinitely beyond the reach of our narrow capacities they do without doubt contain in them all possible perfection but this i say be our way of conceive them and these our ideas of their infinity the idea of finite easily get finite then and infinite be by the mind look on as modifications of expansion and duration the next thing to be consider ishow the mind come by them as for the idea of finite there be no great difficulty the obvious portion of extension that affect our sense carry with them into the mind the idea of finite and the ordinary periods of succession whereby we measure time and duration as hours days and years be bound lengths the difficulty be how we come by those boundless ideas of eternity and immensity since the object we converse with come so much short of any approach or proportion to that largeness how we come by the idea of infinity every one that have any idea of any state lengths of space as a foot find that he can repeat that idea and join it to the former make the idea of two feet and by the addition of a third three feet and so on without ever come to an end of his additions whether of the same idea of a foot or if he please of double it or any other idea he have of any length as a mile or diameter of the earth or of the orbis magnus for whichever of these he take and how often soever he double or any otherwise multiply it he find that after he have continue his double in his thoughts and enlarge his idea as much as he please he have no more reason to stop nor be one jot nearer the end of such addition than he be at first set out the power of enlarge his idea of space by further additions remain still the same he hence take the idea of infinite space our idea of space boundless this i think be the way whereby the mind get the idea of infinite space it be a quite different consideration to examine whether the mind have the idea of such a boundless space actually exist since our ideas be not always proof of the existence of things but yet since this come here in our way i suppose i may say that we be apt to think that space in itself be actually boundless to which imagination the idea of space or expansion of itself naturally lead us for it be consider by us either as the extension of body or as exist by itself without any solid matter take it up for of such a void space we have not only the idea but i have prove as i think from the motion of body its necessary existence it be impossible the mind should be ever able to find or suppose any end of it or be stop anywhere in its progress in this space how far soever it extend its thoughts any bound make with body even adamantine wall be so far from put a stop to the mind in its further progress in space and extension that it rather facilitate and enlarge it for so far as that body reach so far no one can doubt of extension and when we be come to the utmost extremity of body what be there that can there put a stop and satisfy the mind that it be at the end of space when it perceive that it be not nay when it be satisfy that body itself can move into it for if it be necessary for the motion of body that there should be an empty space though ever so little here amongst body and if it be possible for body to move in or through that empty spacenay it be impossible for any particle of matter to move but into an empty space the same possibility of a body move into a void space beyond the utmost bound of body as well as into a void space intersperse amongst body will always remain clear and evident the idea of empty pure space whether within or beyond the confine of all body be exactly the same differ not in nature though in bulk and there be nothing to hinder body from move into it so that wherever the mind place itself by any think either amongst or remote from all body it can in this uniform idea of space nowhere find any bound any end and so must necessarily conclude it by the very nature and idea of each part of it to be actually infinite and so of duration as by the power we find in ourselves of repeat as often as we will any idea of space we get the idea of immensity so by be able to repeat the idea of any length of duration we have in our mind with all the endless addition of number we come by the idea of eternity for we find in ourselves we can no more come to an end of such repeat ideas than we can come to the end of number which every one perceive he can not but here again it be another question quite different from our have an idea of eternity to know whether there be any real be whose duration have be eternal and as to this i say he that consider something now exist must necessarily come to something eternal but have speak of this in another place i shall say here no more of it but proceed on to some other considerations of our idea of infinity why other ideas be not capable of infinity if it be so that our idea of infinity be get from the power we observe in ourselves of repeat without end our own ideas it may be demandedwhy we do not attribute infinity to other ideas as well as those of space and duration since they may be as easily and as often repeat in our mind as the other and yet nobody ever think of infinite sweetness or infinite whiten though he can repeat the idea of sweet or white as frequently as those of a yard or a day to which i answerall the ideas that be consider as have part and be capable of increase by the addition of any equal or less part afford us by their repetition the idea of infinity because with this endless repetition there be continue an enlargement of which there can be no end but in other ideas it be not so for to the largest idea of extension or duration that i at present have the addition of any the least part make an increase but to the perfectest idea i have of the whitest whiten if i add another of a less or equal whiten and of a whiter than i have i can not add the idea it make no increase and enlarge not my idea at all and therefore the different ideas of whiten c be call degrees for those ideas that consist of part be capable of be augment by every addition of the least part but if you take the idea of white which one parcel of snow yield yesterday to our sight and another idea of white from another parcel of snow you see today and put them together in your mind they embody as it be and run into one and the idea of whiten be not at all increase and if we add a less degree of whiten to a greater we be so far from increase that we diminish it those ideas that consist not of part can not be augment to what proportion men please or be stretch beyond what they have receive by their sense but space duration and number be capable of increase by repetition leave in the mind an idea of endless room for more nor can we conceive anywhere a stop to a further addition or progression and so those ideas alone lead our mind towards the think of infinity difference between infinity of space and space infinite though our idea of infinity arise from the contemplation of quantity and the endless increase the mind be able to make in quantity by the repeat additions of what portion thereof it please yet i guess we cause great confusion in our thoughts when we join infinity to any suppose idea of quantity the mind can be think to have and so discourse or reason about an infinite quantity as an infinite space or an infinite duration for as our idea of infinity be as i think an endless grow idea but the idea of any quantity the mind have be at that time terminate in that idea for be it as great as it will it can be no greater than it isto join infinity to it be to adjust a stand measure to a grow bulk and therefore i think it be not an insignificant subtilty if i say that we be carefully to distinguish between the idea of the infinity of space and the idea of a space infinite the first be nothing but a suppose endless progression of the mind over what repeat ideas of space it please but to have actually in the mind the idea of a space infinite be to suppose the mind already pass over and actually to have a view of all those repeat ideas of space which an endless repetition can never totally represent to it which carry in it a plain contradiction we have no idea of infinite space this perhaps will be a little plainer if we consider it in number the infinity of number to the end of whose addition every one perceive there be no approach easily appear to any one that reflect on it but how clear soever this idea of the infinity of number be there be nothing yet more evident than the absurdity of the actual idea of an infinite number whatsoever positive ideas we have in our mind of any space duration or number let them be ever so great they be still finite but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder from which we remove all bound and wherein we allow the mind an endless progression of think without ever complete the idea there we have our idea of infinity which though it seem to be pretty clear when we consider nothing else in it but the negation of an end yet when we would frame in our mind the idea of an infinite space or duration that idea be very obscure and confuse because it be make up of two part very different if not inconsistent for let a man frame in his mind an idea of any space or number as great as he will it be plain the mind rest and terminate in that idea which be contrary to the idea of infinity which consist in a suppose endless progression and therefore i think it be that we be so easily confound when we come to argue and reason about infinite space or duration c because the part of such an idea not be perceive to be as they be inconsistent the one side or other always perplex whatever consequences we draw from the other as an idea of motion not pass on would perplex any one who should argue from such an idea which be not better than an idea of motion at rest and such another seem to me to be the idea of a space or which be the same thing a number infinite ie of a space or number which the mind actually have and so view and terminate in and of a space or number which in a constant and endless enlarge and progression it can in think never attain to for how large soever an idea of space i have in my mind it be no larger than it be that instant that i have it though i be capable the next instant to double it and so on in infinitum for that alone be infinite which have no bound and that the idea of infinity in which our thoughts can find none number afford us the clearest idea of infinity but of all other ideas it be number as i have say which i think furnish us with the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity we be capable of for even in space and duration when the mind pursue the idea of infinity it there make use of the ideas and repetitions of number as of millions and millions of miles or years which be so many distinct ideaskept best by number from run into a confuse heap wherein the mind lose itself and when it have add together as many millions c as it please of know lengths of space or duration the clearest idea it can get of infinity be the confuse incomprehensible remainder of endless addible number which afford no prospect of stop or boundary our different conceptions of the infinity of number contrast with those of duration and expansion it will perhaps give us a little further light into the idea we have of infinity and discover to us that it be nothing but the infinity of number apply to determinate part of which we have in our mind the distinct ideas if we consider that number be not generally think by us infinite whereas duration and extension be apt to be so which arise from hencethat in number we be at one end as it be for there be in number nothing less than an unit we there stop and be at an end but in addition or increase of number we can set no bound and so it be like a line whereof one end terminate with us the other be extend still forward beyond all that we can conceive but in space and duration it be otherwise for in duration we consider it as if this line of number be extend both waysto an unconceivable undeterminate and infinite length which be evident to any one that will but reflect on what consideration he hath of eternity which i suppose will find to be nothing else but the turn this infinity of number both ways a parte ante and a parte post as they speak for when we would consider eternity a parte ante what do we but begin from ourselves and the present time we be in repeat in our mind the ideas of years or age or any other assignable portion of duration past with a prospect of proceed in such addition with all the infinity of number and when we would consider eternity a parte post we just after the same rate begin from ourselves and reckon by multiply periods yet to come still extend that line of number as before and these two be put together be that infinite duration we call eternity which as we turn our view either way forward or backwards appear infinite because we still turn that way the infinite end of number ie the power still of add more how we conceive the infinity of space the same happen also in space wherein conceive ourselves to be as it be in the centre we do on all side pursue those indeterminable line of number and reckon any way from ourselves a yard mile diameter of the earth or orbis magnusby the infinity of number we add others to them as often as we will and have no more reason to set bound to those repeat ideas than we have to set bound to number we have that indeterminable idea of immensity infinite divisibility and since in any bulk of matter our thoughts can never arrive at the utmost divisibility therefore there be an apparent infinity to us also in that which have the infinity also of number but with this differencethat in the former considerations of the infinity of space and duration we only use addition of number whereas this be like the division of an unit into its fraction wherein the mind also can proceed in infinitum as well as in the former additions it be indeed but the addition still of new number though in the addition of the one we can have no more the positive idea of a space infinitely great than in the division of the other we can have the positive idea of a body infinitely littleour idea of infinity be as i may say a grow or fugitive idea still in a boundless progression that can stop nowhere no positive idea of infinity though it be hard i think to find anyone so absurd as to say he have the positive idea of an actual infinite numberthe infinity whereof lie only in a power still of add any combination of units to any former number and that as long and as much as one will the like also be in the infinity of space and duration which power leave always to the mind room for endless additionsyet there be those who imagine they have positive ideas of infinite duration and space it would i think be enough to destroy any such positive idea of infinite to ask him that have itwhether he could add to it or no which would easily show the mistake of such a positive idea we can i think have no positive idea of any space or duration which be not make up of and commensurate to repeat number of feet or yards or days and years which be the common measure whereof we have the ideas in our mind and whereby we judge of the greatness of this sort of quantities and therefore since an infinite idea of space or duration must need be make up of infinite part it can have no other infinity than that of number capable still of further addition but not an actual positive idea of a number infinite for i think it be evident that the addition of finite things together as be all lengths whereof we have the positive ideas can never otherwise produce the idea of infinite than as number do which consist of additions of finite units one to another suggest the idea of infinite only by a power we find we have of still increase the sum and add more of the same kind without come one jot nearer the end of such progression how we can not have a positive idea of infinity in quantity they who would prove their idea of infinite to be positive seem to me to do it by a pleasant argument take from the negation of an end which be negative the negation of it be positive he that consider that the end be in body but the extremity or superficies of that body will not perhaps be forward to grant that the end be a bare negative and he that perceive the end of his pen be black or white will be apt to think that the end be something more than a pure negation nor be it when apply to duration the bare negation of existence but more properly the last moment of it but if they will have the end to be nothing but the bare negation of existence i be sure they can not deny but the begin be the first instant of be and be not by any body conceive to be a bare negation and therefore by their own argument the idea of eternal a parte ante or of a duration without a begin be but a negative idea what be positive what negative in our idea of infinite the idea of infinite have i confess something of positive in all those things we apply to it when we would think of infinite space or duration we at first step usually make some very large idea as perhaps of millions of age or miles which possibly we double and multiply several time all that we thus amass together in our thoughts be positive and the assemblage of a great number of positive ideas of space or duration but what still remain beyond this we have no more a positive distinct notion of than a mariner have of the depth of the sea where have let down a large portion of his soundingline he reach no bottom whereby he know the depth to be so many fathom and more but how much the more be he hath no distinct notion at all and could he always supply new line and find the plummet always sink without ever stop he would be something in the posture of the mind reach after a complete and positive idea of infinity in which case let this line be ten or ten thousand fathom long it equally discover what be beyond it and give only this confuse and comparative idea that this be not all but one may yet go farther so much as the mind comprehend of any space it have a positive idea of but in endeavour ing to make it infiniteit be always enlarge always advancingthe idea be still imperfect and incomplete so much space as the mind take a view of in its contemplation of greatness be a clear picture and positive in the understand but infinite be still greater then the idea of so much be positive and clear the idea of greater be also clear but it be but a comparative idea the idea of so much greater as can not be comprehend and this be plainly negative not positive for he have no positive clear idea of the largeness of any extension which be that seek for in the idea of infinite that have not a comprehensive idea of the dimension of it and such nobody i think pretend to in what be infinite for to say a man have a positive clear idea of any quantity without know how great it be be as reasonable as to say he have the positive clear idea of the number of the sand on the seashore who know not how many there be but only that they be more than twenty for just such a perfect and positive idea have he of an infinite space or duration who say it be larger than the extent or duration of ten one hundred one thousand or any other number of miles or years whereof he have or can have a positive idea which be all the idea i think we have of infinite so that what lie beyond our positive idea towards infinity lie in obscurity and have the indeterminate confusion of a negative idea wherein i know i neither do nor can comprehend all i would it be too large for a finite and narrow capacity and that can not but be very far from a positive complete idea wherein the greatest part of what i would comprehend be leave out under the undeterminate intimation of be still greater for to say that have in any quantity measure so much or go so far you be not yet at the end be only to say that that quantity be greater so that the negation of an end in any quantity be in other word only to say that it be bigger and a total negation of an end be but carry this bigger still with you in all the progressions of your thoughts shall make in quantity and add this idea of still greater to all the ideas you have or can be suppose to have of quantity now whether such an idea as that be positive i leave any one to consider we have no positive idea of an infinite duration i ask those who say they have a positive idea of eternity whether their idea of duration include in it succession or not if it do not they ought to show the difference of their notion of duration when apply to an eternal be and to a finite since perhaps there may be others as well as i who will own to them their weakness of understand in this point and acknowledge that the notion they have of duration force them to conceive that whatever have duration be of a longer continuance today than it be yesterday if to avoid succession in external existence they return to the punctum stans of the school i suppose they will thereby very little mend the matter or help us to a more clear and positive idea of infinite duration there be nothing more inconceivable to me than duration without succession besides that punctum stans if it signify anything be not quantum finite or infinite can not belong to it but if our weak apprehensions can not separate succession from any duration whatsoever our idea of eternity can be nothing but of infinite succession of moments of duration wherein anything do exist and whether any one have or can have a positive idea of an actual infinite number i leave him to consider till his infinite number be so great that he himself can add no more to it and as long as he can increase it i doubt he himself will think the idea he hath of it a little too scanty for positive infinity no complete idea of eternal be i think it unavoidable for every consider rational creature that will but examine his own or any other existence to have the notion of an eternal wise be who have no begin and such an idea of infinite duration i be sure i have but this negation of a begin be but the negation of a positive thing scarce give me a positive idea of infinity which whenever i endeavour to extend my thoughts to i confess myself at a loss and i find i can not attain any clear comprehension of it no positive idea of infinite space he that think he have a positive idea of infinite space will when he consider it find that he can no more have a positive idea of the greatest than he have of the least space for in this latter which seem the easier of the two and more within our comprehension we be capable only of a comparative idea of smallness which will always be less than any one whereof we have the positive idea all our positive ideas of any quantity whether great or little have always bound though our comparative idea whereby we can always add to the one and take from the other hath no bound for that which remain either great or little not be comprehend in that positive idea which we have lie in obscurity and we have no other idea of it but of the power of enlarge the one and diminish the other without cease a pestle and mortar will as soon bring any particle of matter to indivisibility as the acutest think of a mathematician and a surveyor may as soon with his chain measure out infinite space as a philosopher by the quickest flight of mind reach it or by think comprehend it which be to have a positive idea of it he that think on a cube of an inch diameter have a clear and positive idea of it in his mind and so can frame one of and so on till he have the idea in his thoughts of something very little but yet reach not the idea of that incomprehensible littleness which division can produce what remain of smallness be as far from his thoughts as when he first begin and therefore he never come at all to have a clear and positive idea of that smallness which be consequent to infinite divisibility what be positive what negative in our idea of infinite every one that look towards infinity do as i have say at first glance make some very large idea of that which he apply it to let it be space or duration and possibly he weary his thoughts by multiply in his mind that first large idea but yet by that he come no nearer to the have a positive clear idea of what remain to make up a positive infinite than the country fellow have of the water which be yet to come and pass the channel of the river where he stand rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis at ille labitur et labetur in omne volubilis oevum some think they have a positive idea of eternity and not of infinite space there be some i have meet that put so much difference between infinite duration and infinite space that they persuade themselves that they have a positive idea of eternity but that they have not nor can have any idea of infinite space the reason of which mistake i suppose to be thisthat find by a due contemplation of cause and effect that it be necessary to admit some eternal be and so to consider the real existence of that be as take up and commensurate to their idea of eternity but on the other side not find it necessary but on the contrary apparently absurd that body should be infinite they forwardly conclude that they can have no idea of infinite space because they can have no idea of infinite matter which consequence i conceive be very ill collect because the existence of matter be no ways necessary to the existence of space no more than the existence of motion or the sun be necessary to duration though duration use to be measure by it and i doubt not but that a man may have the idea of ten thousand miles square without any body so big as well as the idea of ten thousand years without any body so old it seem as easy to me to have the idea of space empty of body as to think of the capacity of a bushel without corn or the hollow of a nutshell without a kernel in it it be no more necessary that there should be exist a solid body infinitely extend because we have an idea of the infinity of space than it be necessary that the world should be eternal because we have an idea of infinite duration and why should we think our idea of infinite space require the real existence of matter to support it when we find that we have as clear an idea of an infinite duration to come as we have of infinite duration past though i suppose nobody think it conceivable that anything do or have exist in that future duration nor be it possible to join our idea of future duration with present or past existence any more than it be possible to make the ideas of yesterday today and tomorrow to be the same or bring age past and future together and make them contemporary but if these men be of the mind that they have clearer ideas of infinite duration than of infinite space because it be past doubt that god have exist from all eternity but there be no real matter coextended with infinite space yet those philosophers who be of opinion that infinite space be possess by gods infinite omnipresence as well as infinite duration by his eternal existence must be allow to have as clear an idea of infinite space as of infinite duration though neither of them i think have any positive idea of infinity in either case for whatsoever positive ideas a man have in his mind of any quantity he can repeat it and add it to the former as easy as he can add together the ideas of two days or two pace which be positive ideas of lengths he have in his mind and so on as long as he please whereby if a man have a positive idea of infinite either duration or space he could add two infinities together nay make one infinite infinitely bigger than anotherabsurdities too gross to be confute suppose positive ideas of infinity cause of mistake but yet if after all this there be men who persuade themselves that they have clear positive comprehensive ideas of infinity it be fit they enjoy their privilege and i should be very glad with some others that i know who acknowledge they have none such to be better inform by their communication for i have be hitherto apt to think that the great and inextricable difficulties which perpetually involve all discourse concern infinitywhether of space duration or divisibility have be the certain mark of a defect in our ideas of infinity and the disproportion the nature thereof have to the comprehension of our narrow capacities for whilst men talk and dispute of infinite space or duration as if they have as complete and positive ideas of them as they have of the name they use for them or as they have of a yard or an hour or any other determinate quantity it be no wonder if the incomprehensible nature of the thing they discourse of or reason about lead them into perplexities and contradictions and their mind be overlay by an object too large and mighty to be survey and manage by them all these be modes of ideas get from sensation and reflection if i have dwell pretty long on the consideration of duration space and number and what arise from the contemplation of theminfinity it be possibly no more than the matter require there be few simple ideas whose modes give more exercise to the thoughts of men than those do i pretend not to treat of them in their full latitude it suffice to my design to show how the mind receive them such as they be from sensation and reflection and how even the idea we have of infinity how remote soever it may seem to be from any object of sense or operation of our mind have nevertheless as all our other ideas its original there some mathematicians perhaps of advance speculations may have other ways to introduce into their mind ideas of infinity but this hinder not but that they themselves as well as all other men get the first ideas which they have of infinity from sensation and reflection in the method we have here set down other simple modes other simple modes of simple ideas of sensation though i have in the forego chapters show how from simple ideas take in by sensation the mind come to extend itself even to infinity which however it may of all others seem most remote from any sensible perception yet at last hath nothing in it but what be make out of simple ideas receive into the mind by the sense and afterwards there put together by the faculty the mind have to repeat its own ideasthough i say these might be instance enough of simple modes of the simple ideas of sensation and suffice to show how the mind come by them yet i shall for methods sake though briefly give an account of some few more and then proceed to more complex ideas simple modes of motion to slide roll tumble walk creep run dance leap skip and abundance of others that might be name be word which be no sooner hear but every one who understand english have presently in his mind distinct ideas which be all but the different modifications of motion modes of motion answer those of extension swift and slow be two different ideas of motion the measure whereof be make of the distance of time and space put together so they be complex ideas comprehend time and space with motion modes of sound the like variety have we in sound every articulate word be a different modification of sound by which we see that from the sense of hear by such modifications the mind may be furnish with distinct ideas to almost an infinite number sound also besides the distinct cry of bird and beasts be modify by diversity of note of different length put together which make that complex idea call a tune which a musician may have in his mind when he hear or make no sound at all by reflect on the ideas of those sound so put together silently in his own fancy modes of colour those of colour be also very various some we take notice of as the different degrees or as they be term shade of the same colour but since we very seldom make assemblages of colour either for use or delight but figure be take in also and have its part in it as in paint weave needleworks c those which be take notice of do most commonly belong to mix modes as be make up of ideas of divers kinds viz figure and colour such as beauty rainbow c modes of taste all compound taste and smell be also modes make up of the simple ideas of those sense but they be such as generally we have no name for be less take notice of and can not be set down in write and therefore must be leave without enumeration to the thoughts and experience of my reader some simple modes have no name in general it may be observe that those simple modes which be consider but as different degrees of the same simple idea though they be in themselves many of them very distinct ideas yet have ordinarily no distinct name nor be much take notice of as distinct ideas where the difference be but very small between them whether men have neglect these modes and give no name to them as want measure nicely to distinguish them or because when they be so distinguish that knowledge would not be of general or necessary use i leave it to the thoughts of others it be sufficient to my purpose to show that all our simple ideas come to our mind only by sensation and reflection and that when the mind have them it can variously repeat and compound them and so make new complex ideas but though white red or sweet c have not be modify or make into complex ideas by several combinations so as to be name and thereby rank into species yet some others of the simple ideas viz those of unity duration and motion c above instance in as also power and think have be thus modify to a great variety of complex ideas with name belong to them why some modes have and others have not name the reason whereof i suppose have be thisthat the great concernment of men be with men one amongst another the knowledge of men and their action and the signify of them to one another be most necessary and therefore they make ideas of action very nicely modify and give those complex ideas name that they might the more easily record and discourse of those things they be daily conversant in without long ambages and circumlocutions and that the things they be continually to give and receive information about might be the easier and quicker understand that this be so and that men in frame different complex ideas and give them name have be much govern by the end of speech in general which be a very short and expedite way of convey their thoughts one to another be evident in the name which in several arts have be find out and apply to several complex ideas of modify action belong to their several trade for dispatch sake in their direction or discourse about them which ideas be not generally frame in the mind of men not conversant about these operations and thence the word that stand for them by the greatest part of men of the same language be not understand vg coltshire drill filtration cohobation be word stand for certain complex ideas which be seldom in the mind of any but those few whose particular employments do at every turn suggest them to their thoughts those name of them be not generally understand but by smiths and chymists who have frame the complex ideas which these word stand for and have give name to them or receive them from others upon hear of these name in communication readily conceive those ideas in their mindsas by cohobation all the simple ideas of distil and the pour the liquor distil from anything back upon the remain matter and distil it again thus we see that there be great varieties of simple ideas as of taste and smell which have no name and of modes many more which either not have be generally enough observe or else not be of any great use to be take notice of in the affairs and converse of men they have not have name give to them and so pass not for species this we shall have occasion hereafter to consider more at large when we come to speak of word of the modes of think sensation remembrance contemplation c modes of think when the mind turn its view inwards upon itself and contemplate its own action think be the first that occur in it the mind observe a great variety of modifications and from thence receive distinct ideas thus the perception or think which actually accompany and be annex to any impression on the body make by an external object be distinct from all other modifications of think furnish the mind with a distinct idea which we call sensationwhich be as it be the actual entrance of any idea into the understand by the sense the same idea when it again recur without the operation of the like object on the external sensory be remembrance if it be seek after by the mind and with pain and endeavour find and bring again in view it be recollection if it be hold there long under attentive consideration it be contemplation when ideas float in our mind without any reflection or regard of the understand it be that which the french call reverie our language have scarce a name for it when the ideas that offer themselves for as i have observe in another place whilst we be awake there will always be a train of ideas succeed one an other in our mind be take notice of and as it be register in the memory it be attention when the mind with great earnestness and of choice fix its view on any idea consider it on all side and will not be call off by the ordinary solicitation of other ideas it be that we call intention or study sleep without dream be rest from all these and dream itself be the have of ideas whilst the outward sense be stop so that they receive not outward object with their usual quickness in the mind not suggest by any external object or know occasion nor under any choice or conduct of the understand at all and whether that which we call ecstasy be not dream with the eye open i leave to be examine other modes of think these be some few instance of those various modes of think which the mind may observe in itself and so have as distinct ideas of as it hath of white and red a square or a circle i do not pretend to enumerate them all nor to treat at large of this set of ideas which be get from reflection that would be to make a volume it suffice to my present purpose to have show here by some few examples of what sort these ideas be and how the mind come by them especially since i shall have occasion hereafter to treat more at large of reason judge volition and knowledge which be some of the most considerable operations of the mind and modes of think the various degrees of attention in think but perhaps it may not be an unpardonable digression nor wholly impertinent to our present design if we reflect here upon the different state of the mind in think which those instance of attention reverie and dream c before mention naturally enough suggest that there be ideas some or other always present in the mind of a wake man every ones experience convince him though the mind employ itself about them with several degrees of attention sometimes the mind fix itself with so much earnestness on the contemplation of some object that it turn their ideas on all side mark their relations and circumstances and view every part so nicely and with such intention that it shut out all other thoughts and take no notice of the ordinary impressions make then on the sense which at another season would produce very sensible perceptions at other time it barely observe the train of ideas that succeed in the understand without direct and pursue any of them and at other time it let them pass almost quite unregarded as faint shadow that make no impression hence it be probable that think be the action not the essence of the soul this difference of intention and remission of the mind in think with a great variety of degrees between earnest study and very near mind nothing at all every one i think have experiment in himself trace it a little further and you find the mind in sleep retire as it be from the sense and out of the reach of those motion make on the organs of sense which at other time produce very vivid and sensible ideas i need not for this instance in those who sleep out whole stormy nights without hear the thunder or see the lightning or feel the shake of the house which be sensible enough to those who be wake but in this retirement of the mind from the sense it often retain a yet more loose and incoherent manner of think which we call dream and last of all sound sleep close the scene quite and put an end to all appearances this i think almost every one have experience of in himself and his own observation without difficulty lead him thus far that which i would further conclude from hence be that since the mind can sensibly put on at several time several degrees of think and be sometimes even in a wake man so remiss as to have thoughts dim and obscure to that degree that they be very little remove from none at all and at last in the dark retirements of sound sleep lose the sight perfectly of all ideas whatsoever since i say this be evidently so in matter of fact and constant experience i ask whether it be not probable that think be the action and not the essence of the soul since the operations of agents will easily admit of intention and remission but the essences of things be not conceive capable of any such variation but this by the by of modes of pleasure and pain pleasure and pain simple ideas amongst the simple ideas which we receive both from sensation and reflection pain and pleasure be two very considerable ones for as in the body there be sensation barely in itself or accompany with pain or pleasure so the think or perception of the mind be simply so or else accompany also with pleasure or pain delight or trouble call it how you please these like other simple ideas can not be describe nor their name define the way of know them be as of the simple ideas of the sense only by experience for to define them by the presence of good or evil be no otherwise to make them know to us than by make us reflect on what we feel in ourselves upon the several and various operations of good and evil upon our mind as they be differently apply to or consider by us good and evil what things then be good or evil only in reference to pleasure or pain that we call good which be apt to cause or increase pleasure or diminish pain in us or else to procure or preserve us the possession of any other good or absence of any evil and on the contrary we name that evil which be apt to produce or increase any pain or diminish any pleasure in us or else to procure us any evil or deprive us of any good by pleasure and pain i must be understand to mean of body or mind as they be commonly distinguish though in truth they be only different constitutions of the mind sometimes occasion by disorder in the body sometimes by thoughts of the mind our passions move by good and evil pleasure and pain and that which cause themgood and evil be the hinge on which our passions turn and if we reflect on ourselves and observe how these under various considerations operate in us what modifications or temper of mind what internal sensations if i may so call them they produce in us we may thence form to ourselves the ideas of our passions love thus any one reflect upon the think he have of the delight which any present or absent thing be apt to produce in him have the idea we call love for when a man declare in autumn when he be eat them or in spring when there be none that he love grapes it be no more but that the taste of grapes delight him let an alteration of health or constitution destroy the delight of their taste and he then can be say to love grapes no longer hatred on the contrary the think of the pain which anything present or absent be apt to produce in us be what we call hatred be it my business here to inquire any further than into the bare ideas of our passions as they depend on different modifications of pleasure and pain i should remark that our love and hatred of inanimate insensible be be commonly found on that pleasure and pain which we receive from their use and application any way to our sense though with their destruction but hatred or love to be capable of happiness or misery be often the uneasiness or delight which we find in ourselves arise from a consideration of their very be or happiness thus the be and welfare of a man children or friends produce constant delight in him he be say constantly to love them but it suffice to note that our ideas of love and hatred be but the dispositions of the mind in respect of pleasure and pain in general however cause in us desire the uneasiness a man find in himself upon the absence of anything whose present enjoyment carry the idea of delight with it be that we call desire which be greater or less as that uneasiness be more or less vehement where by the by it may perhaps be of some use to remark that the chief if not only spur to human industry and action be uneasiness for whatsoever good be propose if its absence carry no displeasure or pain with it if a man be easy and content without it there be no desire of it nor endeavour after it there be no more but a bare velleity the term use to signify the lowest degree of desire and that which be next to none at all when there be so little uneasiness in the absence of anything that it carry a man no further than some faint wish for it without any more effectual or vigorous use of the mean to attain it desire also be stop or abate by the opinion of the im possibility or unattainableness of the good propose as far as the uneasiness be cure or allay by that consideration this might carry our thoughts further be it seasonable in this place joy be a delight of the mind from the consideration of the present or assure approach possession of a good and we be then possess of any good when we have it so in our power that we can use it when we please thus a man almost starve have joy at the arrival of relief even before he have the pleasure of use it and a father in whom the very wellbeing of his children cause delight be always as long as his children be in such a state in the possession of that good for he need but to reflect on it to have that pleasure sorrow be uneasiness in the mind upon the think of a good lose which might have be enjoy longer or the sense of a present evil hope be that pleasure in the mind which every one find in himself upon the think of a probable future enjoyment of a thing which be apt to delight him fear be an uneasiness of the mind upon the think of future evil likely to befal us despair be the think of the unattainableness of any good which work differently in mens mind sometimes produce uneasiness or pain sometimes rest and indolency anger be uneasiness or discomposure of the mind upon the receipt of any injury with a present purpose of revenge envy be an uneasiness of the mind cause by the consideration of a good we desire obtain by one we think should not have have it before us what passions all men have these two last envy and anger not be cause by pain and pleasure simply in themselves but have in them some mix considerations of ourselves and others be not therefore to be find in all men because those other part of value their merit or intend revenge be want in them but all the rest terminate purely in pain and pleasure be i think to be find in all men for we love desire rejoice and hope only in respect of pleasure we hate fear and grieve only in respect of pain ultimately in fine all these passions be move by things only as they appear to be the cause of pleasure and pain or to have pleasure or pain some way or other annex to them thus we extend our hatred usually to the subject at least if a sensible or voluntary agent which have produce pain in us because the fear it leave be a constant pain but we do not so constantly love what have do us good because pleasure operate not so strongly on us as pain and because we be not so ready to have hope it will do so again but this by the by pleasure and pain what by pleasure and pain delight and uneasiness i must all along be understand as i have above intimate to mean not only bodily pain and pleasure but whatsoever delight or uneasiness be felt by us whether arise from any grateful or unacceptable sensation or reflection removal or lessen of either it be further to be consider that in reference to the passions the removal or lessen of a pain be consider and operate as a pleasure and the loss or diminish of a pleasure as a pain shame the passions too have most of them in most persons operations on the body and cause various change in it which not be always sensible do not make a necessary part of the idea of each passion for shame which be an uneasiness of the mind upon the think of have do something which be indecent or will lessen the value esteem which others have for us have not always blush accompany it these instance to show how our ideas of the passions be get from sensation and reflection i would not be mistake here as if i mean this as a discourse of the passions they be many more than those i have here name and those i have take notice of would each of them require a much larger and more accurate discourse i have only mention these here as so many instance of modes of pleasure and pain result in our mind from various considerations of good and evil i might perhaps have instance in other modes of pleasure and pain more simple than these as the pain of hunger and thirst and the pleasure of eat and drink to remove them the pain of teeth set on edge the pleasure of music pain from captious uninstructive wrangle and the pleasure of rational conversation with a friend or of welldirected study in the search and discovery of truth but the passions be of much more concernment to us i rather make choice to instance in them and show how the ideas we have of them be derive from sensation or reflection of power this idea how get the mind be every day inform by the sense of the alteration of those simple ideas it observe in things without and take notice how one come to an end and cease to be and another begin to exist which be not before reflect also on what pass within itself and observe a constant change of its ideas sometimes by the impression of outward object on the sense and sometimes by the determination of its own choice and conclude from what it have so constantly observe to have be that the like change will for the future be make in the same things by like agents and by the like waysconsiders in one thing the possibility of have any of its simple ideas change and in another the possibility of make that change and so come by that idea which we call power thus we say fire have a power to melt gold ie to destroy the consistency of its insensible part and consequently its hardness and make it fluid and gold have a power to be melt that the sun have a power to blanch wax and wax a power to be blanch by the sun whereby the yellowness be destroy and whiten make to exist in its room in which and the like case the power we consider be in reference to the change of perceivable ideas for we can not observe any alteration to be make in or operation upon anything but by the observable change of its sensible ideas nor conceive any alteration to be make but by conceive a change of some of its ideas power active and passive power thus consider be twofold viz as able to make or able to receive any change the one may be call active and the other passive power whether matter be not wholly destitute of active power as its author god be truly above all passive power and whether the intermediate state of create spirit be not that alone which be capable of both active and passive power may be worth consideration i shall not now enter into that inquiry my present business be not to search into the original of power but how we come by the idea of it but since active power make so great a part of our complex ideas of natural substances as we shall see hereafter and i mention them as such accord to common apprehension yet they be not perhaps so truly active power as our hasty thoughts be apt to represent them i judge it not amiss by this intimation to direct our mind to the consideration of god and spirit for the clearest idea of active power power include relation i confess power include in it some kind of relation a relation to action or change as indeed which of our ideas of what kind soever when attentively consider do not for our ideas of extension duration and number do they not all contain in them a secret relation of the part figure and motion have something relative in them much more visibly and sensible qualities as colour and smell c what be they but the power of different body in relation to our perception c and if consider in the things themselves do they not depend on the bulk figure texture and motion of the part all which include some kind of relation in them our idea therefore of power i think may well have a place amongst other simple ideas and be consider as one of them be one of those that make a principal ingredient in our complex ideas of substances as we shall hereafter have occasion to observe the clearest idea of active power have from spirit we be abundantly furnish with the idea of passive power by almost all sort of sensible things in most of them we can not avoid observe their sensible qualities nay their very substances to be in a continual flux and therefore with reason we look on them as liable still to the same change nor have we of active power which be the more proper signification of the word power fewer instance since whatever change be observe the mind must collect a power somewhere able to make that change as well as a possibility in the thing itself to receive it but yet if we will consider it attentively body by our sense do not afford us so clear and distinct an idea of active power as we have from reflection on the operations of our mind for all power relate to action and there be but two sort of action whereof we have an idea viz think and motion let us consider whence we have the clearest ideas of the power which produce these action of think body afford us no idea at all it be only from reflection that we have that neither have we from body any idea of the begin of motion a body at rest afford us no idea of any active power to move and when it be set in motion itself that motion be rather a passion than an action in it for when the ball obey the motion of a billiardstick it be not any action of the ball but bare passion also when by impulse it set another ball in motion that lay in its way it only communicate the motion it have receive from another and lose in itself so much as the other receive which give us but a very obscure idea of an active power of move in body whilst we observe it only to transfer but not produce any motion for it be but a very obscure idea of power which reach not the production of the action but the continuation of the passion for so be motion in a body impel by another the continuation of the alteration make in it from rest to motion be little more an action than the continuation of the alteration of its figure by the same blow be an action the idea of the begin of motion we have only from reflection on what pass in ourselves where we find by experience that barely by will it barely by a think of the mind we can move the part of our body which be before at rest so that it seem to me we have from the observation of the operation of body by our sense but a very imperfect obscure idea of active power since they afford us not any idea in themselves of the power to begin any action either motion or think but if from the impulse body be observe to make one upon another any one think he have a clear idea of power it serve as well to my purpose sensation be one of those ways whereby the mind come by its ideas only i think it worth while to consider here by the way whether the mind doth not receive its idea of active power clearer from reflection on its own operations than it doth from any external sensation will and understand two power in mind or spirit this at least i think evidentthat we find in ourselves a power to begin or forbear continue or end several action of our mind and motion of our body barely by a think or preference of the mind order or as it be command the do or not do such or such a particular action this power which the mind have thus to order the consideration of any idea or the forbear to consider it or to prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest and vice versa in any particular instance be that which we call the will the actual exercise of that power by direct any particular action or its forbearance be that which we call volition or will the forbearance of that action consequent to such order or command of the mind be call voluntary and whatsoever action be perform without such a think of the mind be call involuntary the power of perception be that which we call the understand perception which we make the act of the understand be of three sort the perception of ideas in our mind the perception of the signification of sign the perception of the connexion or repugnancy agreement or disagreement that there be between any of our ideas all these be attribute to the understand or perceptive power though it be the two latter only that use allow us to say we understand faculties not real be these power of the mind viz of perceive and of prefer be usually call by another name and the ordinary way of speak be that the understand and will be two faculties of the mind a word proper enough if it be use as all word should be so as not to breed any confusion in mens thoughts by be suppose as i suspect it have be to stand for some real be in the soul that perform those action of understand and volition for when we say the will be the command and superior faculty of the soul that it be or be not free that it determine the inferior faculties that it follow the dictate of the understand cthough these and the like expressions by those that carefully attend to their own ideas and conduct their thoughts more by the evidence of things than the sound of word may be understand in a clear and distinct senseyet i suspect i say that this way of speak of faculties have mislead many into a confuse notion of so many distinct agents in us which have their several provinces and authorities and do command obey and perform several action as so many distinct be which have be no small occasion of wrangle obscurity and uncertainty in question relate to them whence the ideas of liberty and necessity every one i think find in himself a power to begin or forbear continue or put an end to several action in himself from the consideration of the extent of this power of the mind over the action of the man which everyone find in himself arise the ideas of liberty and necessity liberty what all the action that we have any idea of reduce themselves as have be say to these two viz think and motion so far as a man have power to think or not to think to move or not to move accord to the preference or direction of his own mind so far be a man free wherever any performance or forbearance be not equally in a man power wherever do or not do will not equally follow upon the preference of his mind direct it there he be not free though perhaps the action may be voluntary so that the idea of liberty be the idea of a power in any agent to do or forbear any particular action accord to the determination or think of the mind whereby either of them be prefer to the other where either of them be not in the power of the agent to be produce by him accord to his volition there he be not at liberty that agent be under necessity so that liberty can not be where there be no think no volition no will but there may be think there may be will there may be volition where there be no liberty a little consideration of an obvious instance or two may make this clear suppose understand and will a tennisball whether in motion by the stroke of a racket or lie still at rest be not by any one take to be a free agent if we inquire into the reason we shall find it be because we conceive not a tennisball to think and consequently not to have any volition or preference of motion to rest or vice versa and therefore have not liberty be not a free agent but all its both motion and rest come under our idea of necessary and be so call likewise a man fall into the water a bridge break under him have not herein liberty be not a free agent for though he have volition though he prefer his not fall to fall yet the forbearance of that motion not be in his power the stop or cessation of that motion follow not upon his volition and therefore therein he be not free so a man strike himself or his friend by a convulsive motion of his arm which it be not in his power by volition or the direction of his mind to stop or forbear nobody think he have in this liberty every one pity him as act by necessity and constraint belong not to volition again suppose a man be carry whilst fast asleep into a room where be a person he long to see and speak with and be there lock fast in beyond his power to get out he awake and be glad to find himself in so desirable company which he stay willingly in ie prefer his stay to go away i ask be not this stay voluntary i think nobody will doubt it and yet be lock fast in it be evident he be not at liberty not to stay he have not freedom to be go so that liberty be not an idea belong to volition or prefer but to the person have the power of do or forbear to do accord as the mind shall choose or direct our idea of liberty reach as far as that power and no farther for wherever restraint come to check that power or compulsion take away that indifferency of ability to act or to forbear act there liberty and our notion of it presently cease voluntary oppose to involuntary not to necessary we have instance enough and often more than enough in our own body a man heart beat and the blood circulate which it be not in his power by any think or volition to stop and therefore in respect of these motion where rest depend not on his choice nor would follow the determination of his mind if it should prefer it he be not a free agent convulsive motion agitate his legs so that though he will it ever so much he can not by any power of his mind stop their motion as in that odd disease call chorea sancti viti but he be perpetually dance he be not at liberty in this action but under as much necessity of move as a stone that fall or a tennisball strike with a racket on the other side a palsy or the stock hinder his legs from obey the determination of his mind if it would thereby transfer his body to another place in all these there be want of freedom though the sit still even of a paralytic whilst he prefer it to a removal be truly voluntary voluntary then be not oppose to necessary but to involuntary for a man may prefer what he can do to what he can not do the state he be in to its absence or change though necessity have make it in itself unalterable liberty what as it be in the motion of the body so it be in the thoughts of our mind where any one be such that we have power to take it up or lay it by accord to the preference of the mind there we be at liberty a wake man be under the necessity of have some ideas constantly in his mind be not at liberty to think or not to think no more than he be at liberty whether his body shall touch any other or no but whether he will remove his contemplation from one idea to another be many time in his choice and then he be in respect of his ideas as much at liberty as he be in respect of body he rest on he can at pleasure remove himself from one to another but yet some ideas to the mind like some motion to the body be such as in certain circumstances it can not avoid nor obtain their absence by the utmost effort it can use a man on the rack be not at liberty to lay by the idea of pain and divert himself with other contemplations and sometimes a boisterous passion hurry our thoughts as a hurricane do our body without leave us the liberty of think on other things which we would rather choose but as soon as the mind regain the power to stop or continue begin or forbear any of these motion of the body without or thoughts within accord as it think fit to prefer either to the other we then consider the man as a free agent again necessity what wherever think be wholly want or the power to act or forbear accord to the direction of think there necessity take place this in an agent capable of volition when the begin or continuation of any action be contrary to that preference of his mind be call compulsion when the hinder or stop any action be contrary to his volition it be call restraint agents that have no think no volition at all be in everything necessary agents liberty belong not to the will if this be so as i imagine it be i leave it to be consider whether it may not help to put an end to that long agitate and i think unreasonable because unintelligible question viz whether man will be free or no for if i mistake not it follow from what i have say that the question itself be altogether improper and it be as insignificant to ask whether man will be free as to ask whether his sleep be swift or his virtue square liberty be as little applicable to the will as swiftness of motion be to sleep or squareness to virtue every one would laugh at the absurdity of such a question as either of these because it be obvious that the modifications of motion belong not to sleep nor the difference of figure to virtue and when one well consider it i think he will as plainly perceive that liberty which be but a power belong only to agents and can not be an attribute or modification of the will which be also but a power volition such be the difficulty of explain and give clear notions of internal action by sound that i must here warn my reader that order direct choose prefer c which i have make use of will not distinctly enough express volition unless he will reflect on what he himself do when he will for example prefer which seem perhaps best to express the act of volition do it not precisely for though a man would prefer fly to walk yet who can say he ever will it volition it be plain be an act of the mind knowingly exert that dominion it take itself to have over any part of the man by employ it in or withhold it from any particular action and what be the will but the faculty to do this and be that faculty anything more in effect than a power the power of the mind to determine its think to the produce continue or stop any action as far as it depend on us for can it be deny that whatever agent have a power to think on its own action and to prefer their do or omission either to other have that faculty call will will then be nothing but such a power liberty on the other side be the power a man have to do or forbear do any particular action accord as its do or forbearance have the actual preference in the mind which be the same thing as to say accord as he himself will it power belong to agents it be plain then that the will be nothing but one power or ability and freedom another power or ability so that to ask whether the will have freedom be to ask whether one power have another power one ability another ability a question at first sight too grossly absurd to make a dispute or need an answer for who be it that see not that power belong only to agents and be attribute only of substances and not of power themselves so that this way of put the question viz whether the will be free be in effect to ask whether the will be a substance an agent or at least to suppose it since freedom can properly be attribute to nothing else if freedom can with any propriety of speech be apply to power it may be attribute to the power that be in a man to produce or forbear produce motion in part of his body by choice or preference which be that which denominate him free and be freedom itself but if any one should ask whether freedom be free he would be suspect not to understand well what he say and he would be think to deserve midass ears who know that rich be a denomination for the possession of riches should demand whether riches themselves be rich how the will instead of the man be call free however the name faculty which men have give to this power call the will and whereby they have be lead into a way of talk of the will as act may by an appropriation that disguise its true sense serve a little to palliate the absurdity yet the will in truth signify nothing but a power or ability to prefer or choose and when the will under the name of a faculty be consider as it be barely as an ability to do something the absurdity in say it be free or not free will easily discover itself for if it be reasonable to suppose and talk of faculties as distinct be that can act as we do when we say the will order and the will be free it be fit that we should make a speak faculty and a walk faculty and a dance faculty by which these action be produce which be but several modes of motion as well as we make the will and understand to be faculties by which the action of choose and perceive be produce which be but several modes of think and we may as properly say that it be the sing faculty sing and the dance faculty dance as that the will choose or that the understand conceive or as be usual that the will direct the understand or the understand obey or obey not the will it be altogether as proper and intelligible to say that the power of speak direct the power of sing or the power of sing obey or disobey the power of speak this way of talk cause confusion of think this way of talk nevertheless have prevail and as i guess produce great confusion for these be all different power in the mind or in the man to do several action he exert them as he think fit but the power to do one action be not operate on by the power of do another action for the power of think operate not on the power of choose nor the power of choose on the power of think no more than the power of dance operate on the power of sing or the power of sing on the power of dance as any one who reflect on it will easily perceive and yet this be it which we say when we thus speak that the will operate on the understand or the understand on the will power be relations not agents i grant that this or that actual think may be the occasion of volition or exercise the power a man have to choose or the actual choice of the mind the cause of actual think on this or that thing as the actual sing of such a tune may be the cause of dance such a dance and the actual dance of such a dance the occasion of sing such a tune but in all these it be not one power that operate on another but it be the mind that operate and exert these power it be the man that do the action it be the agent that have power or be able to do for power be relations not agents and that which have the power or not the power to operate be that alone which be or be not free and not the power itself for freedom or not freedom can belong to nothing but what have or have not a power to act liberty belong not to the will the attribute to faculties that which belong not to them have give occasion to this way of talk but the introduce into discourse concern the mind with the name of faculties a notion of their operate have i suppose as little advance our knowledge in that part of ourselves as the great use and mention of the like invention of faculties in the operations of the body have help us in the knowledge of physic not that i deny there be faculties both in the body and mind they both of them have their power of operate else neither the one nor the other could operate for nothing can operate that be not able to operate and that be not able to operate that have no power to operate nor do i deny that those word and the like be to have their place in the common use of languages that have make them current it look like too much affectation wholly to lay them by and philosophy itself though it like not a gaudy dress yet when it appear in public must have so much complacency as to be clothe in the ordinary fashion and language of the country so far as it can consist with truth and perspicuity but the fault have be that faculties have be speak of and represent as so many distinct agents for it be ask what it be that digest the meat in our stomach it be a ready and very satisfactory answer to say that it be the digestive faculty what be it that make anything come out of the body the expulsive faculty what move the motive faculty and so in the mind the intellectual faculty or the understand understand and the elective faculty or the will will or command this be in short to say that the ability to digest digest and the ability to move move and the ability to understand understand for faculty ability and power i think be but different name of the same things which ways of speak when put into more intelligible word will i think amount to thus muchthat digestion be perform by something that be able to digest motion by something able to move and understand by something able to understand and in truth it would be very strange if it should be otherwise as strange as it would be for a man to be free without be able to be free but to the agent or man to return then to the inquiry about liberty i think the question be not proper whether the will be free but whether a man be free thus i think first that so far as any one can by the direction or choice of his mind prefer the existence of any action to the nonexistence of that action and vice versa make it to exist or not exist so far he be free for if i can by a think direct the motion of my finger make it move when it be at rest or vice versa it be evident that in respect of that i be free and if i can by a like think of my mind prefer one to the other produce either word or silence i be at liberty to speak or hold my peace and as far as this power reach of act or not act by the determination of his own think prefer either so far be a man free for how can we think any one freer than to have the power to do what he will and so far as any one can by prefer any action to its not be or rest to any action produce that action or rest so far can he do what he will for such a prefer of action to its absence be the will of it and we can scarce tell how to imagine any be freer than to be able to do what he will so that in respect of action within the reach of such a power in him a man seem as free as it be possible for freedom to make him in respect of will a man be not free but the inquisitive mind of man will to shift off from himself as far as he can all thoughts of guilt though it be by put himself into a worse state than that of fatal necessity be not content with this freedom unless it reach further than this will not serve the turn and it pass for a good plea that a man be not free at all if he be not as free to will as he be to act what he will concern a man liberty there yet therefore be raise this further question whether a man be free to will which i think be what be mean when it be dispute whether the will be free and as to that i imagine how a man can not be free to will secondly that will or volition be an action and freedom consist in a power of act or not act a man in respect of will or the act of volition when any action in his power be once propose to his thoughts as presently to be do can not be free the reason whereof be very manifest for it be unavoidable that the action depend on his will should exist or not exist and its existence or not existence follow perfectly the determination and preference of his will he can not avoid will the existence or nonexistence of that action it be absolutely necessary that he will the one or the other ie prefer the one to the other since one of them must necessarily follow and that which do follow follow by the choice and determination of his mind that be by his will it for if he do not will it it would not be so that in respect of the act of will a man in such a case be not free liberty consist in a power to act or not to act which in regard of volition a man upon such a proposal have not for it be unavoidably necessary to prefer the do or forbearance of an action in a man power which be once so propose to his thoughts a man must necessarily will the one or the other of them upon which preference or volition the action or its forbearance certainly follow and be truly voluntary but the act of volition or prefer one of the two be that which he can not avoid a man in respect of that act of will be under a necessity and so can not be free unless necessity and freedom can consist together and a man can be free and bind at once besides to make a man free after this manner by make the action of will to depend on his will there must be another antecedent will to determine the act of this will and another to determine that and so in infinitum for wherever one stop the action of the last will can not be free nor be any be as far i can com prehend be above me capable of such a freedom of will that it can forbear to will ie to prefer the be or not be of anything in its power which it have once consider as such liberty be freedom to execute what be will this then be evident that a man be not at liberty to will or not to will anything in his power that he once consider of liberty consist in a power to act or to forbear act and in that only for a man that sit still be say yet to be at liberty because he can walk if he will it a man that walk be at liberty also not because he walk or move but because he can stand still if he will it but if a man sit still have not a power to remove himself he be not at liberty so likewise a man fall down a precipice though in motion be not at liberty because he can not stop that motion if he would this be so it be plain that a man that be walk to whom it be propose to give off walk be not at liberty whether he will determine himself to walk or give off walk or not he must necessarily prefer one or the other of them walk or not walk and so it be in regard of all other action in our power so propose which be the far greater number for consider the vast number of voluntary action that succeed one another every moment that we be awake in the course of our live there be but few of them that be think on or propose to the will till the time they be to be do and in all such action as i have show the mind in respect of will have not a power to act or not to act wherein consist liberty the mind in that case have not a power to forbear will it can not avoid some determination concern them let the consideration be as short the think as quick as it will it either leave the man in the state he be before think or change it continue the action or put an end to it whereby it be manifest that it order and direct one in preference to or with neglect of the other and thereby either the continuation or change become unavoidably voluntary the will determine by something without it since then it be plain that in most case a man be not at liberty whether he will or no for when an action in his power be propose to his thoughts he can not forbear volition he must determine one way or the other the next thing demand iswhether a man be at liberty to will which of the two he please motion or rest this question carry the absurdity of it so manifestly in itself that one might thereby sufficiently be convince that liberty concern not the will for to ask whether a man be at liberty to will either motion or rest speak or silence which he please be to ask whether a man can will what he will or be please with what he be please with a question which i think need no answer and they who can make a question of it must suppose one will to determine the act of another and another to determine that and so on in infinitum the ideas of liberty and volition must be define to avoid these and the like absurdities nothing can be of greater use than to establish in our mind determine ideas of the things under consideration if the ideas of liberty and volition be well fix in our understand and carry along with us in our mind as they ought through all the question that be raise about them i suppose a great part of the difficulties that perplex mens thoughts and entangle their understand would be much easier resolve and we should perceive where the confuse signification of term or where the nature of the thing cause the obscurity freedom first then it be carefully to be remember that freedom consist in the dependence of the existence or not existence of any action upon our volition of it and not in the dependence of any action or its contrary on our preference a man stand on a cliff be at liberty to leap twenty yards downwards into the sea not because he have a power to do the contrary action which be to leap twenty yards upwards for that he can not do but he be therefore free because he have a power to leap or not to leap but if a greater force than his either hold him fast or tumble him down he be no longer free in that case because the do or forbearance of that particular action be no longer in his power he that be a close prisoner in a room twenty feet square be at the north side of his chamber be at liberty to walk twenty feet southward because he can walk or not walk it but be not at the same time at liberty to do the contrary ie to walk twenty feet northward in this then consist freedom viz in our be able to act or not to act accord as we shall choose or will what volition and action mean secondly we must remember that volition or will be an act of the mind direct its think to the production of any action and thereby exert its power to produce it to avoid multiply of word i would crave leave here under the word action to comprehend the forbearance too of any action propose sit still or hold ones peace when walk or speak be propose though mere forbearances require as much the determination of the will and be as often weighty in their consequences as the contrary action may on that consideration well enough pass for action too but this i say that i may not be mistake if for brevitys sake i speak thus what determine the will thirdly the will be nothing but a power in the mind to direct the operative faculties of a man to motion or rest as far as they depend on such direction to the question what be it determine the will the true and proper answer be the mind for that which determine the general power of direct to this or that particular direction be nothing but the agent itself exercise the power it have that particular way if this answer satisfy not it be plain the mean of the question what determine the will be thiswhat move the mind in every particular instance to determine its general power of direct to this or that particular motion or rest and to this i answer the motive for continue in the same state or action be only the present satisfaction in it the motive to change be always some uneasiness nothing set us upon the change of state or upon any new action but some uneasiness this be the great motive that work on the mind to put it upon action which for shortness sake we will call determine of the will which i shall more at large explain will and desire must not be confound but in the way to it it will be necessary to premise that though i have above endeavour to express the act of volition by choose prefer and the like term that signify desire as well as volition for want of other word to mark that act of the mind whose proper name be will or volition yet it be a very simple act whosoever desire to understand what it be will better find it by reflect on his own mind and observe what it do when it will than by any variety of articulate sound whatsoever this caution of be careful not to be mislead by expressions that do not enough keep up the difference between the will and several act of the mind that be quite distinct from it i think the more necessary because i find the will often confound with several of the affections especially desire and one put for the other and that by men who would not willingly be think not to have have very distinct notions of things and not to have writ very clearly about them this i imagine have be no small occasion of obscurity and mistake in this matter and therefore be as much as may be to be avoid for he that shall turn his thoughts inwards upon what pass in his mind when he will shall see that the will or power of volition be conversant about nothing but our own action terminate there and reach no further and that volition be nothing but that particular determination of the mind whereby barely by a think the mind endeavour to give rise continuation or stop to any action which it take to be in its power this well consider plainly show that the will be perfectly distinguish from desire which in the very same action may have a quite contrary tendency from that which our will set us upon a man whom i can not deny may oblige me to use persuasions to another which at the same time i be speak i may wish may not prevail on him in this case it be plain the will and desire run counter i will the action that tend one way whilst my desire tend another and that the direct contrary way a man who by a violent fit of the gout in his limbs find a doziness in his head or a want of appetite in his stomach remove desire to be ease too of the pain of his feet or hand for wherever there be pain there be a desire to be rid of it though yet whilst he apprehend that the removal of the pain may translate the noxious humour to a more vital part his will be never determine to any one action that may serve to remove this pain whence it be evident that desire and will be two distinct act of the mind and consequently that the will which be but the power of volition be much more distinct from desire uneasiness determine the will to return then to the inquiry what be it that determine the will in regard to our action and that upon second thoughts i be apt to imagine be not as be generally suppose the greater good in view but some and for the most part the most press uneasiness a man be at present under this be that which successively determine the will and set us upon those action we perform this uneasiness we may call as it be desire which be an uneasiness of the mind for want of some absent good all pain of the body of what sort soever and disquiet of the mind be uneasiness and with this be always join desire equal to the pain or uneasiness felt and be scarce distinguishable from it for desire be nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent good in reference to any pain felt ease be that absent good and till that ease be attain we may call it desire nobody feel pain that he wish not to be ease of with a desire equal to that pain and inseparable from it besides this desire of ease from pain there be another of absent positive good and here also the desire and uneasiness be equal as much as we desire any absent good so much be we in pain for it but here all absent good do not accord to the greatness it have or be acknowledge to have cause pain equal to that greatness as all pain cause desire equal to itself because the absence of good be not always a pain as the presence of pain be and therefore absent good may be look on and consider without desire but so much as there be anywhere of desire so much there be of uneasiness desire be uneasiness that desire be a state of uneasiness every one who reflect on himself will quickly find who be there that have not felt in desire what the wise man say of hope which be not much different from it that it be defer make the heart sick and that still proportionable to the greatness of the desire which sometimes raise the uneasiness to that pitch that it make people cry out give me children give me the thing desire or i die life itself and all its enjoyments be a burden can not be bear under the last and unremoved pressure of such an uneasiness the uneasiness of desire determine the will good and evil present and absent it be true work upon the mind but that which immediately determine the will from time to time to every voluntary action be the uneasiness of desire fix on some absent good either negative as indolence to one in pain or positive as enjoyment of pleasure that it be this uneasiness that determine the will to the successive voluntary action whereof the greatest part of our live be make up and by which we be conduct through different course to different end i shall endeavour to show both from experience and the reason of the thing this be the spring of action when a man be perfectly content with the state he be inwhich be when he be perfectly without any uneasinesswhat industry what action what will be there leave but to continue in it of this every man observation will satisfy him and thus we see our allwise maker suitably to our constitution and frame and know what it be that determine the will have put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst and other natural desire that return at their season to move and determine their will for the preservation of themselves and the continuation of their species for i think we may conclude that if the bare contemplation of these good end to which we be carry by these several uneasinesses have be sufficient to determine the will and set us on work we should have have none of these natural pain and perhaps in this world little or no pain at all it be better to marry than to burn say st paul where we may see what it be that chiefly drive men into the enjoyments of a conjugal life a little burn felt push us more powerfully than greater pleasures in prospect draw or allure the greatest positive good determine not the will but present uneasiness alone it seem so establish and settle a maxim by the general consent of all mankind that good the greater good determine the will that i do not at all wonder that when i first publish my thoughts on this subject i take it for grant and i imagine that by a great many i shall be think more excusable for have then do so than that now i have venture to recede from so receive an opinion but yet upon a stricter inquiry i be force to conclude that good the greater good though apprehend and acknowledge to be so do not determine the will until our desire raise proportionably to it make us uneasy in the want of it convince a man never so much that plenty have its advantage over poverty make him see and own that the handsome conveniences of life be better than nasty penury yet as long as he be content with the latter and find no uneasiness in it he move not his will never be determine to any action that shall bring him out of it let a man be ever so well persuade of the advantage of virtue that it be as necessary to a man who have any great aim in this world or hop in the next as food to life yet till he hunger or thirst after righteousness till he feel an uneasiness in the want of it his will will not be determine to any action in pursuit of this confess greater good but any other uneasiness he feel in himself shall take place and carry his will to other action on the other side let a drunkard see that his health decay his estate waste discredit and diseases and the want of all things even of his beloved drink attend him in the course he follow yet the return of uneasiness to miss his companion the habitual thirst after his cup at the usual time drive him to the tavern though he have in his view the loss of health and plenty and perhaps of the joy of another life the least of which be no inconsiderable good but such as he confess be far greater than the tickle of his palate with a glass of wine or the idle chat of a soak club it be not want of view the greater good for he see and acknowledge it and in the intervals of his drink hours will take resolutions to pursue the greater good but when the uneasiness to miss his accustom delight return the great acknowledge good lose its hold and the present uneasiness determine the will to the accustom action which thereby get stronger foot to prevail against the next occasion though he at the same time make secret promise to himself that he will do so no more this be the last time he will act against the attainment of those greater goods and thus he be from time to time in the state of that unhappy complainer video meliora proboque deteriora sequor which sentence allow for true and make good by constant experience may in this and possibly no other way be easily make intelligible because the removal of uneasiness be the first step to happiness if we inquire into the reason of what experience make so evident in fact and examine why it be uneasiness alone operate on the will and determine it in its choice we shall find that we be capable but of one determination of the will to one action at once the present uneasiness that we be under do naturally determine the will in order to that happiness which we all aim at in all our action for as much as whilst we be under any uneasiness we can not apprehend ourselves happy or in the way to it pain and uneasiness be by every one conclude and felt to be inconsistent with happiness spoil the relish even of those good things which we have a little pain serve to mar all the pleasure we rejoice in and therefore that which of course determine the choice of our will to the next action will always bethe remove of pain as long as we have any leave as the first and necessary step towards happiness because uneasiness alone be present another reason why it be uneasiness alone determine the will be this because that alone be present and it be against the nature of things that what be absent should operate where it be not it may be say that absent good may by contemplation be bring home to the mind and make present the idea of it indeed may be in the mind and view as present there but nothing will be in the mind as a present good able to counterbalance the removal of any uneasiness which we be under till it raise our desire and the uneasiness of that have the prevalency in determine the will till then the idea in the mind of whatever be good be there only like other ideas the object of bare unactive speculation but operate not on the will nor set us on work the reason whereof i shall show by and by how many be to be find that have have lively representations set before their mind of the unspeakable joy of heaven which they acknowledge both possible and probable too who yet would be content to take up with their happiness here and so the prevail uneasiness of their desire let loose after the enjoyments of this life take their turn in the determine their will and all that while they take not one step be not one jot move towards the good things of another life consider as ever so great because all who allow the joy of heaven possible pursue them not be the will determine by the view of good as it appear in contemplation greater or less to the understand which be the state of all absent good and that which in the receive opinion the will be suppose to move to and to be move byi do not see how it could ever get loose from the infinite eternal joy of heaven once propose and consider as possible for all absent good by which alone barely propose and come in view the will be think to be determine and so to set us on action be only possible but not infallibly certain it be unavoidable that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all the successive action it direct and then we should keep constantly and steadily in our course towards heaven without ever stand still or direct our action to any other end the eternal condition of a future state infinitely outweigh the expectation of riches or honour or any other worldly pleasure which we can propose to ourselves though we should grant these the more probable to be obtain for nothing future be yet in possession and so the expectation even of these may deceive us if it be so that the greater good in view determine the will so great a good once propose could not but seize the will and hold it fast to the pursuit of this infinitely greatest good without ever let it go again for the will have a power over and direct the thoughts as well as other action would if it be so hold the contemplation of the mind fix to that good but any great uneasiness be never neglect this would be the state of the mind and regular tendency of the will in all its determinations be it determine by that which be consider and in view the greater good but that it be not so be visible in experience the infinitely greatest confess good be often neglect to satisfy the successive uneasiness of our desire pursue trifle but though the greatest allow even everlasting unspeakable good which have sometimes move and affect the mind do not stedfastly hold the will yet we see any very great and prevail uneasiness have once lay hold on the will let it not go by which we may be convince what it be that determine the will thus any vehement pain of the body the ungovernable passion of a man violently in love or the impatient desire of revenge keep the will steady and intent and the will thus determine never let the understand lay by the object but all the thoughts of the mind and power of the body be uninterruptedly employ that way by the determination of the will influence by that top uneasiness as long as it last whereby it seem to me evident that the will or power of set us upon one action in preference to all others be determine in us by uneasiness and whether this be not so i desire every one to observe in himself desire accompany all uneasiness i have hitherto chiefly instance in the uneasiness of desire as that which determine the will because that be the chief and most sensible and the will seldom order any action nor be there any voluntary action perform without some desire accompany it which i think be the reason why the will and desire be so often confound but yet we be not to look upon the uneasiness which make up or at least accompany most of the other passions as wholly exclude in the case aversion fear anger envy shame c have each their uneasinesses too and thereby influence the will these passions be scarce any of them in life and practice simple and alone and wholly unmixed with others though usually in discourse and contemplation that carry the name which operate strongest and appear most in the present state of the mind nay there be i think scarce any of the passions to be find without desire join with it i be sure wherever there be uneasiness there be desire for we constantly desire happiness and whatever we feel of uneasiness so much it be certain we want of happiness even in our own opinion let our state and condition otherwise be what it will besides the present moment not be our eternity whatever our enjoyment be we look beyond the present and desire go with our foresight and that still carry the will with it so that even in joy itself that which keep up the action whereon the enjoyment depend be the desire to continue it and fear to lose it and whenever a greater uneasiness than that take place in the mind the will presently be by that determine to some new action and the present delight neglect the most press uneasiness naturally determine the will but we be in this world beset with sundry uneasinesses distract with different desire the next inquiry naturally will bewhich of them have the precedency in determine the will to the next action and to that the answer isthat ordinarily which be the most press of those that be judge capable of be then remove for the will be the power of direct our operative faculties to some action for some end can not at any time be move towards what be judge at that time unattainable that would be to suppose an intelligent be designedly to act for an end only to lose its labour for so it be to act for what be judge not attainable and therefore very great uneasinesses move not the will when they be judge not capable of a cure they in that case put us not upon endeavour but these set apart the most important and urgent uneasiness we at that time feel be that which ordinarily determine the will successively in that train of voluntary action which make up our live the greatest present uneasiness be the spur to action that be constantly most felt and for the most part determine the will in its choice of the next action for this we must carry along with us that the proper and only object of the will be some action of ours and nothing else for we produce nothing by our will it but some action in our power it be there the will terminate and reach no further all desire happiness if it be further askedwhat it be move desire i answerhappiness and that alone happiness and misery be the name of two extremes the utmost bound whereof we know not it be what eye hath not see ear hath not hear nor hath it enter into the heart of man to conceive but of some degrees of both we have very lively impressions make by several instance of delight and joy on the one side and torment and sorrow on the other which for shortness sake i shall comprehend under the name of pleasure and pain there be pleasure and pain of the mind as well as the bodywith him be fulness of joy and pleasure for evermore or to speak truly they be all of the mind though some have their rise in the mind from think others in the body from certain modifications of motion happiness and misery good and evil what they be happiness then in its full extent be the utmost pleasure we be capable of and misery the utmost pain and the lowest degree of what can be call happiness be so much ease from all pain and so much present pleasure as without which any one can not be content now because pleasure and pain be produce in us by the operation of certain object either on our mind or our body and in different degrees therefore what have an aptness to produce pleasure in us be that we call good and what be apt to produce pain in us we call evil for no other reason but for its aptness to produce pleasure and pain in us wherein consist our happiness and misery further though what be apt to produce any degree of pleasure be in itself good and what be apt to produce any degree of pain be evil yet it often happen that we do not call it so when it come in competition with a greater of its sort because when they come in competition the degrees also of pleasure and pain have justly a preference so that if we will rightly estimate what we call good and evil we shall find it lie much in comparison for the cause of every less degree of pain as well as every greater degree of pleasure have the nature of good and vice versa what good be desire what not though this be that which be call good and evil and all good be the proper object of desire in general yet all good even see and confess to be so do not necessarily move every particular man desire but only that part or so much of it as be consider and take to make a necessary part of his happiness all other good however great in reality or appearance excite not a man desire who look not on it to make a part of that happiness wherewith he in his present thoughts can satisfy himself happiness under this view every one constantly pursue and desire what make any part of it other things acknowledge to be good he can look upon without desire pass by and be content without there be nobody i think so senseless as to deny that there be pleasure in knowledge and for the pleasures of sense they have too many followers to let it be question whether men be take with them or no now let one man place his satisfaction in sensual pleasures another in the delight of knowledge though each of them can not but confess there be great pleasure in what the other pursue yet neither of them make the others delight a part of his happiness their desire be not move but each be satisfy without what the other enjoy and so his will be not determine to the pursuit of it but yet as soon as the studious man hunger and thirst make him uneasy he whose will be never determine to any pursuit of good cheer poignant sauce delicious wine by the pleasant taste he have find in them be by the uneasiness of hunger and thirst presently determine to eat and drink though possibly with great indifferency what wholesome food come in his way and on the other side the epicure buckle to study when shame or the desire to recommend himself to his mistress shall make him uneasy in the want of any sort of knowledge thus how much soever men be in earnest and constant in pursuit of happiness yet they may have a clear view of good great and confess good without be concern for it or move by it if they think they can make up their happiness without it though as to pain that they be always concern for they can feel no uneasiness without be move and therefore be uneasy in the want of whatever be judge necessary to their happiness as soon as any good appear to make a part of their portion of happiness they begin to desire it why the greatest good be not always desire this i think any one may observe in himself and others that the greater visible good do not always raise mens desire in proportion to the greatness it appear and be acknowledge to have though every little trouble move us and set us on work to get rid of it the reason whereof be evident from the nature of our happiness and misery itself all present pain whatever it be make a part of our present misery but all absent good do not at any time make a necessary part of our present happiness nor the absence of it make a part of our misery if it do we should be constantly and infinitely miserable there be infinite degrees of happiness which be not in our possession all uneasiness therefore be remove a moderate portion of good serve at present to content men and a few degrees of pleasure in a succession of ordinary enjoyments make up a happiness wherein they can be satisfy if this be not so there could be no room for those indifferent and visibly trifle action to which our will be so often determine and wherein we voluntarily waste so much of our live which remissness could by no mean consist with a constant determination of will or desire to the greatest apparent good that this be so i think few people need go far from home to be convince and indeed in this life there be not many whose happiness reach so far as to afford them a constant train of moderate mean pleasures without any mixture of uneasiness and yet they could be content to stay here for ever though they can not deny but that it be possible there may be a state of eternal durable joy after this life far surpass all the good that be to be find here nay they can not but see that it be more possible than the attainment and continuation of that pittance of honour riches or pleasure which they pursue and for which they neglect that eternal state but yet in full view of this difference satisfy of the possibility of a perfect secure and last happiness in a future state and under a clear conviction that it be not to be have herewhilst they bind their happiness within some little enjoyment or aim of this life and exclude the joy of heaven from make any necessary part of ittheir desire be not move by this greater apparent good nor their will determine to any action or endeavour for its attainment why not be desire it move not the will the ordinary necessities of our live fill a great part of them with the uneasinesses of hunger thirst heat cold weariness with labour and sleepiness in their constant return c to which if besides accidental harm we add the fantastical uneasiness as itch after honour power or riches c which acquire habit by fashion example and education have settle in us and a thousand other irregular desire which custom have make natural to us we shall find that a very little part of our life be so vacant from these uneasinesses as to leave us free to the attraction of remoter absent good we be seldom at ease and free enough from the solicitation of our natural or adopt desire but a constant succession of uneasinesses out of that stock which natural want or acquire habit have heap up take the will in their turn and no sooner be one action dispatch which by such a determination of the will we be set upon but another uneasiness be ready to set us on work for the remove of the pain we feel and be at present press with be the get out of misery and consequently the first thing to be do in order to happinessabsent good though think on confess and appear to be good not make any part of this unhappiness in its absence be justled out to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we feel till due and repeat contemplation have bring it nearer to our mind give some relish of it and raise in us some desire which then begin to make a part of our present uneasiness stand upon fair term with the rest to be satisfy and so accord to its greatness and pressure come in its turn to determine the will due consideration raise desire and thus by a due consideration and examine any good propose it be in our power to raise our desire in a due proportion to the value of that good whereby in its turn and place it may come to work upon the will and be pursue for good though appear and allow ever so great yet till it have raise desire in our mind and thereby make us uneasy in its want it reach not our will we be not within the sphere of its activity our will be under the determination only of those uneasinesses which be present to us which whilst we have any be always solicit and ready at hand to give the will its next determination the balance when there be any in the mind be only which desire shall be next satisfy which uneasiness first remove whereby it come to pass that as long as any uneasiness any desire remain in our mind there be no room for good barely as such to come at the will or at all to determine it because as have be say the first step in our endeavour after happiness be to get wholly out of the confine of misery and to feel no part of it the will can be at leisure for nothing else till every uneasiness we feel be perfectly remove which in the multitude of want and desire we be beset with in this imperfect state we be not like to be ever free from in this world the power to suspend the prosecution of any desire make way for consideration there be in us a great many uneasinesses always solicit and ready to determine the will it be natural as i have say that the greatest and most press should determine the will to the next action and so it do for the most part but not always for the mind have in most case as be evident in experience a power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desire and so all one after another be at liberty to consider the object of them examine them on all side and weigh them with others in this lie the liberty man have and from the not use of it right come all that variety of mistake errors and fault which we run into in the conduct of our live and our endeavour after happiness whilst we precipitate the determination of our will and engage too soon before due examination to prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this or that desire as every one daily may experiment in himself this seem to me the source of all liberty in this seem to consist that which be as i think improperly call freewill for during this suspension of any desire before the will be determine to action and the action which follow that determination do we have opportunity to examine view and judge of the good or evil of what we be go to do and when upon due examination we have judge we have do our duty all that we can or ought to do in pursuit of our happiness and it be not a fault but a perfection of our nature to desire will and act accord to the last result of a fair examination to be determine by our own judgment be no restraint to liberty this be so far from be a restraint or diminution of freedom that it be the very improvement and benefit of it it be not an abridgment it be the end and use of our liberty and the further we be remove from such a determination the nearer we be to misery and slavery a perfect indifference in the mind not determinable by its last judgment of the good or evil that be think to attend its choice would be so far from be an advantage and excellency of any intellectual nature that it would be as great an imperfection as the want of indifferency to act or not to act till determine by the will would be an imperfection on the other side a man be at liberty to lift up his hand to his head or let it rest quiet he be perfectly indifferent in either and it would be an imperfection in him if he want that power if he be deprive of that indifferency but it would be as great an imperfection if he have the same indifferency whether he would prefer the lift up his hand or its remain in rest when it would save his head or eye from a blow he see come it be as much a perfection that desire or the power of prefer should be determine by good as that the power of act should be determine by the will and the certainer such determination be the greater be the perfection nay be we determine by anything but the last result of our own mind judge of the good or evil of any action we be not free the very end of our freedom be that we may attain the good we choose and therefore every man be put under a necessity by his constitution as an intelligent be to be determine in will by his own think and judgment what be best for him to do else he would be under the determination of some other than himself which be want of liberty and to deny that a man will in every determination follow his own judgment be to say that a man will and act for an end that he would not have at the time that he will and act for it for if he prefer it in his present thoughts before any other it be plain he then think better of it and would have it before any other unless he can have and not have it will and not will it at the same time a contradiction too manifest to be admit the freest agents be so determine if we look upon those superior be above us who enjoy perfect happiness we shall have reason to judge that they be more steadily determine in their choice of good than we and yet we have no reason to think they be less happy or less free than we be and if it be fit for such poor finite creatures as we be to pronounce what infinite wisdom and goodness could do i think we might say that god himself can not choose what be not good the freedom of the almighty hinder not his be determine by what be best a constant determination to a pursuit of happiness no abridgment of liberty but to give a right view of this mistake part of liberty let me askwould any one be a changeling because he be less determine by wise considerations than a wise man be it worth the name of freedom to be at liberty to play the fool and draw shame and misery upon a man self if to break loose from the conduct of reason and to want that restraint of examination and judgment which keep us from choose or do the worse be liberty true liberty madmen and fool be the only freemen but yet i think nobody would choose to be mad for the sake of such liberty but he that be mad already the constant desire of happiness and the constraint it put upon us to act for it nobody i think account an abridgment of liberty or at least an abridgment of liberty to be complain of god almighty himself be under the necessity of be happy and the more any intelligent be be so the nearer be its approach to infinite perfection and happiness that in this state of ignorance we shortsighted creatures might not mistake true felicity we be endow with a power to suspend any particular desire and keep it from determine the will and engage us in action this be stand still where we be not suffi ciently assure of the way examination be consult a guide the determination of the will upon inquiry be follow the direction of that guide and he that have a power to act or not to act accord as such determination direct be a free agent such determination abridge not that power wherein liberty consist he that have his chain knock off and the prison doors set open to him be perfectly at liberty because he may either go or stay as he best like though his preference be determine to stay by the darkness of the night or illness of the weather or want of other lodge he cease not to be free though the desire of some convenience to be have there absolutely determine his preference and make him stay in his prison the necessity of pursue true happiness the foundation of liberty as therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lie in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness so the care of ourselves that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness be the necessary foundation of our liberty the stronger tie we have to an unalterable pursuit of happiness in general which be our greatest good and which as such our desire always follow the more be we free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action and from a necessary compliance with our desire set upon any particular and then appear preferable good till we have duly examine whether it have a tendency to or be inconsistent with our real happiness and therefore till we be as much inform upon this inquiry as the weight of the matter and the nature of the case demand we be by the necessity of prefer and pursue true happiness as our greatest good oblige to suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular case power to suspend this be the hinge on which turn the liberty of intellectual be in their constant endeavour after and a steady prosecution of true felicitythat they can suspend this prosecution in particular case till they have look before them and inform themselves whether that particular thing which be then propose or desire lie in the way to their main end and make a real part of that which be their greatest good for the inclination and tendency of their nature to happiness be an obligation and motive to them to take care not to mistake or miss it and so necessarily put them upon caution deliberation and wariness in the direction of their particular action which be the mean to obtain it whatever necessity determine to the pursuit of real bliss the same necessity with the same force establish suspense deliberation and scrutiny of each successive desire whether the satisfaction of it do not interfere with our true happiness and mislead us from it this as seem to me be the great privilege of finite intellectual be and i desire it may be well consider whether the great inlet and exercise of all the liberty men have be capable of or can be useful to them and that whereon depend the turn of their action do not lie in thisthat they can suspend their desire and stop them from determine their will to any action till they have duly and fairly examine the good and evil of it as far forth as the weight of the thing require this we be able to do and when we have do it we have do our duty and all that be in our power and indeed all that need for since the will suppose knowledge to guide its choice all that we can do be to hold our will undetermined till we have examine the good and evil of what we desire what follow after that follow in a chain of consequences link one to another all depend on the last determination of the judgment which whether it shall be upon a hasty and precipitate view or upon a due and mature examination be in our power experience show us that in most case we be able to suspend the present satisfaction of any desire government of our passions the right improvement of liberty but if any extreme disturbance as sometimes it happen possess our whole mind as when the pain of the rack an impetuous uneasiness as of love anger or any other violent passion run away with us allow us not the liberty of think and we be not master enough of our own mind to consider thoroughly and examine fairlygod who know our frailty pity our weakness and require of us no more than we be able to do and see what be and what be not in our power will judge as a kind and merciful father but the forbearance of a too hasty compliance with our desire the moderation and restraint of our passions so that our understand may be free to examine and reason unbiased give its judgment be that whereon a right direction of our conduct to true happiness depend it be in this we should employ our chief care and endeavour in this we should take pain to suit the relish of our mind to the true intrinsic good or ill that be in things and not permit an allow or suppose possible great and weighty good to slip out of our thoughts without leave any relish any desire of itself there till by a due consideration of its true worth we have form appetites in our mind suitable to it and make ourselves uneasy in the want of it or in the fear of lose it and how much this be in every ones power by make resolutions to himself such as he may keep be easy for every one to try nor let any one say he can not govern his passions nor hinder them from break out and carry him into action for what he can do before a prince or a great man he can do alone or in the presence of god if he will how men come to pursue different and often evil course from what have be say it be easy to give an account how it come to pass that though all men desire happiness yet their will carry them so contrarily and consequently some of them to what be evil and to this i say that the various and contrary choices that men make in the world do not argue that they do not all pursue good but that the same thing be not good to every man alike this variety of pursuits show that every one do not place his happiness in the same thing or choose the same way to it be all the concern of man terminate in this life why one follow study and knowledge and another hawk and hunt why one choose luxury and debauchery and another sobriety and riches would not be because every one of these do not aim at his own happiness but because their happiness be place in different things and therefore it be a right answer of the physician to his patient that have sore eyesif you have more pleasure in the taste of wine than in the use of your sight wine be good for you but if the pleasure of see be greater to you than that of drink wine be naught all men seek happiness but not of the same sort the mind have a different relish as well as the palate and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all men with riches or glory which yet some men place their happiness in as you would to satisfy all mens hunger with cheese or lobsters which though very agreeable and delicious fare to some be to others extremely nauseous and offensive and many persons would with reason prefer the grip of an hungry belly to those dish which be a feast to others hence it be i think that the philosophers of old do in vain inquire whether summum bonum consist in riches or bodily delight or virtue or contemplation and they might have as reasonably dispute whether the best relish be to be find in apples plums or nut and have divide themselves into sects upon it for as pleasant taste depend not on the things themselves but on their agreeableness to this or that particular palate wherein there be great variety so the greatest happiness consist in the have those things which produce the greatest pleasure and in the absence of those which cause any disturbance any pain now these to different men be very different things if therefore men in this life only have hope if in this life only they can enjoy it be not strange nor unreasonable that they should seek their happiness by avoid all things that disease them here and by pursue all that delight them wherein it will be no wonder to find variety and difference for if there be no prospect beyond the grave the inference be certainly rightlet us eat and drink let us enjoy what we for tomorrow we shall die this i think may serve to show us the reason why though all mens desire tend to happiness yet they be not move by the same object men may choose different things and yet all choose right suppose them only like a company of poor insects whereof some be be delight with flower and their sweetness others beetle delight with other kinds of viands which have enjoy for a season they would cease to be and exist no more for ever power to suspend volition explain responsibility for ill choice these things duly weigh will give us as i think a clear view into the state of human liberty liberty it be plain consist in a power to do or not to do to do or forbear do as we will this can not be deny but this seem to comprehend only the action of a man consecutive to volition it be further inquiredwhether he be at liberty to will or no and to this it have be answer that in most case a man be not at liberty to forbear the act of volition he must exert an act of his will whereby the action propose be make to exist or not to exist but yet there be a case wherein a man be at liberty in respect of will and that be the choose of a remote good as an end to be pursue here a man may suspend the act of his choice from be determine for or against the thing propose till he have examine whether it be really of a nature in itself and consequences to make him happy or not for when he have once choose it and thereby it be become a part of his happiness it raise desire and that proportionably give him uneasiness which determine his will and set him at work in pursuit of his choice on all occasion that offer and here we may see how it come to pass that a man may justly incur punishment though it be certain that in all the particular action that he will he do and necessarily do will that which he then judge to be good for though his will be always determine by that which be judge good by his understand yet it excuse him not because by a too hasty choice of his own make he have impose on himself wrong measure of good and evil which however false and fallacious have the same influence on all his future conduct as if they be true and right he have vitiate his own palate and must be answerable to himself for the sickness and death that follow from it the eternal law and nature of things must not be alter to comply with his illordered choice if the neglect or abuse of the liberty he have to examine what would really and truly make for his happiness mislead him the miscarriages that follow on it must be impute to his own election he have a power to suspend his determination it be give him that he might examine and take care of his own happiness and look that he be not deceive and he could never judge that it be better to be deceive than not in a matter of so great and near concernment why men choose what make them miserable what have be say may also discover to us the reason why men in this world prefer different things and pursue happiness by contrary course but yet since men be always constant and in earnest in matter of happiness and misery the question still remain how men come often to prefer the worse to the better and to choose that which by their own confession have make them miserable the cause of this to account for the various and contrary ways men take though all aim at be happy we must consider whence the various uneasinesses that determine the will in the preference of each voluntary action have their rise from bodily pain some of them come from cause not in our power such as be often the pain of the body from want disease or outward injuries as the rack c which when present and violent operate for the most part forcibly on the will and turn the course of mens live from virtue piety and religion and what before they judge to lead to happiness every one not endeavour or through disuse not be able by the contemplation of remote and future good to raise in himself desire of them strong enough to counterbalance the uneasiness he feel in those bodily torment and to keep his will steady in the choice of those action which lead to future happiness a neighbour country have be of late a tragical theatre from which we might fetch instance if there need any and the world do not in all countries and age furnish examples enough to confirm that receive observation necessitas cogit ad turpia and therefore there be great reason for us to pray lead us not into temptation from wrong desire arise from wrong judgments other uneasinesses arise from our desire of absent good which desire always bear proportion to and depend on the judgment we make and the relish we have of any absent good in both which we be apt to be variously mislead and that by our own fault our judgment of present good or evil always right in the first place i shall consider the wrong judgments men make of future good and evil whereby their desire be mislead for as to present happiness and misery when that alone come into consideration and the consequences be quite remove a man never choose amiss he know what best please him and that he actually prefer things in their present enjoyment be what they seem the apparent and real good be in this case always the same for the pain or pleasure be just so great and no greater than it be felt the present good or evil be really so much as it appear and therefore be every action of ours conclude within itself and draw no consequences after it we should undoubtedly never err in our choice of good we should always infallibly prefer the best be the pain of honest industry and of starve with hunger and cold set together before us nobody would be in doubt which to choose be the satisfaction of a lust and the joy of heaven offer at once to any ones present possession he would not balance or err in the determination of his choice our wrong judgments have regard to future good and evil only but since our voluntary action carry not all the happiness and misery that depend on them along with them in their present performance but be the precedent cause of good and evil which they draw after them and bring upon us when they themselves be past and cease to be our desire look beyond our present enjoyments and carry the mind out to absent good accord to the necessity which we think there be of it to the make or increase of our happiness it be our opinion of such a necessity that give it its attraction without that we be not move by absent good for in this narrow scantling of capacity which we be accustom to and sensible of here wherein we enjoy but one pleasure at once which when all uneasiness be away be whilst it last sufficient to make us think ourselves happy it be not all remote and even apparent good that affect us because the indolency and enjoyment we have suffice for our present happiness we desire not to venture the change since we judge that we be happy already be content and that be enough for who be content be happy but as soon as any new uneasiness come in this happiness be disturb and we be set afresh on work in the pursuit of happiness from a wrong judgment of what make a necessary part of their happiness their aptness therefore to conclude that they can be happy without it be one great occasion that men often be not raise to the desire of the greatest absent good for whilst such thoughts possess them the joy of a future state move them not they have little concern or uneasiness about them and the will free from the determination of such desire be leave to the pursuit of nearer satisfactions and to the removal of those uneasinesses which it then feel in its want of and long after them change but a man view of these things let him see that virtue and religion be necessary to his happiness let him look into the future state of bliss or misery and see there god the righteous judge ready to render to every man accord to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in welldoing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life but unto every soul that doth evil indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish to him i say who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect happiness or misery that attend all men after this life depend on their behaviour here the measure of good and evil that govern his choice be mightily change for since nothing of pleasure and pain in this life can bear any proportion to the endless happiness or exquisite misery of an immortal soul hereafter action in his power will have their preference not accord to the transient pleasure or pain that accompany or follow them here but as they serve to secure that perfect durable happiness hereafter a more particular account of wrong judgments but to account more particularly for the misery that men often bring on themselves notwithstanding that they do all in earnest pursue happiness we must consider how things come to be represent to our desire under deceitful appearances and that be by the judgment pronounce wrongly concern them to see how far this reach and what be the cause of wrong judgment we must remember that things be judge good or bad in a double sense first that which be properly good or bad be nothing but barely pleasure or pain secondly but because not only present pleasure and pain but that also which be apt by its efficacy or consequences to bring it upon us at a distance be a proper object of our desire and apt to move a creature that have foresight therefore things also that draw after them pleasure and pain be consider as good and evil no one choose misery willingly but only by wrong judgment the wrong judgment that mislead us and make the will often fasten on the worse side lie in misreporting upon the various comparisons of these the wrong judgment i be here speak of be not what one man may think of the determination of another but what every man himself must confess to be wrong for since i lay it for a certain grind that every intelligent be really seek happiness which consist in the enjoyment of pleasure without any considerable mixture of uneasiness it be impossible anyone should willingly put into his own draught any bitter ingredient or leave out anything in his power that would tend to his satisfaction and the complete of his happiness but only by a wrong judgment i shall not here speak of that mistake which be the consequence of invincible error which scarce deserve the name of wrong judgment but of that wrong judgment which every man himself must confess to be so men may err in compare present and future therefore as to present pleasure and pain the mind as have be say never mistake that which be really good or evil that which be the greater pleasure or the greater pain be really just as it appear but though present pleasure and pain show their difference and degrees so plainly as not to leave room to mistake yet when we compare present pleasure or pain with future which be usually the case in most important determinations of the will we often make wrong judgments of them take our measure of them in different position of distance object near our view be apt to be think greater than those of a larger size that be more remote and so it be with pleasures and pain the present be apt to carry it and those at a distance have the disadvantage in the comparison thus most men like spendthrift heirs be apt to judge a little in hand better than a great deal to come and so for small matter in possession part with greater ones in reversion but that this be a wrong judgment every one must allow let his pleasure consist in whatever it will since that which be future will certainly come to be present and then have the same advantage of nearness will show itself in its full dimension and discover his wilful mistake who judge of it by unequal measure be the pleasure of drink accompany the very moment a man take off his glass with that sick stomach and ache head which in some men be sure to follow not many hours after i think nobody whatever pleasure he have in his cup would on these condition ever let wine touch his lips which yet he daily swallow and the evil side come to be choose only by the fallacy of a little difference in time but if pleasure or pain can be so lessen only by a few hours removal how much more will it be so by a further distance to a man that will not by a right judgment do what time will ie bring it home upon himself and consider it as present and there take its true dimension this be the way we usually impose on ourselves in respect of bare pleasure and pain or the true degrees of happiness or misery the future lose its just proportion and what be present obtain the preference as the greater i mention not here the wrong judgment whereby the absent be not only lessen but reduce to perfect nothing when men enjoy what they can in present and make sure of that conclude amiss that no evil will thence follow for that lie not in compare the greatness of future good and evil which be that we be here speak of but in another sort of wrong judgment which be concern good or evil as it be consider to be the cause and procurement of pleasure or pain that will follow from it cause of our judge amiss when we compare present pleasure and pain with future the cause of our judge amiss when we compare our present pleasure or pain with future seem to me to be the weak and narrow constitution of our mind we can not well enjoy two pleasures at once much less any pleasure almost whilst pain possess us the present pleasure if it be not very languid and almost none at all fill our narrow souls and so take up the whole mind that it scarce leave any think of things absent or if among our pleasures there be some which be not strong enough to exclude the consideration of things at a distance yet we have so great an abhorrence of pain that a little of it extinguish all our pleasures a little bitter mingle in our cup leave no relish of the sweet hence it come that at any rate we desire to be rid of the present evil which we be apt to think nothing absent can equal because under the present pain we find not ourselves capable of any the least degree of happiness mens daily complaints be a loud proof of this the pain that any one actually feel be still of all other the worst and it be with anguish they cry outany rather than this nothing can be so intolerable as what i now suffer and therefore our whole endeavour and thoughts be intent to get rid of the present evil before all things as the first necessary condition to our happiness let what will follow nothing as we passionately think can exceed or almost equal the uneasiness that sit so heavy upon us and because the abstinence from a present pleasure that offer itself be a pain nay oftentimes a very great one the desire be inflame by a near and tempt object it be no wonder that that operate after the same manner pain do and lessen in our thoughts what be future and so force us as it be blindfold into its embrace absent good unable to counterbalance present uneasiness add to this that absent good or which be the same thing future pleasureespecially if of a sort we be unacquainted withseldom be able to counterbalance any uneasiness either of pain or desire which be present for its greatness be no more than what shall be really taste when enjoy men be apt enough to lessen that to make it give place to any present desire and conclude with themselves that when it come to trial it may possibly not answer the report or opinion that generally pass of it they have often find that not only what others have magnify but even what they themselves have enjoy with great pleasure and delight at one time have prove insipid or nauseous at another and therefore they see nothing in it for which they should forego a present enjoyment but that this be a false way of judge when apply to the happiness of another life they must confess unless they will say god can not make those happy he design to be so for that be intend for a state of happiness it must certainly be agreeable to everyones wish and desire could we suppose their relish as different there as they be here yet the manna in heaven will suit every ones palate thus much of the wrong judgment we make of present and future pleasure and pain when they be compare together and so the absent consider as future wrong judgment in consider consequences of action ii as to things good or bad in their consequences and by the aptness that be in them to procure us good or evil in the future we judge amiss several ways when we judge that so much evil do not really depend on them as in truth there do when we judge that though the consequence be of that moment yet it be not of that certainty but that it may otherwise fall out or else by some mean be avoid as by industry address change repentance c that these be wrong ways of judge be easy to show in every particular if i would examine them at large singly but i shall only mention this in general viz that it be a very wrong and irrational way of proceed to venture a greater good for a less upon uncertain guess and before a due examination be make proportionable to the weightiness of the matter and the concernment it be to us not to mistake this i think every one must confess especially if he consider the usual cause of this wrong judgment whereof these follow be some cause of this i ignorance he that judge without inform himself to the utmost that he be capable can not acquit himself of judge amiss ii inadvertency when a man overlook even that which he do know this be an affect and present ignorance which mislead our judgments as much as the other judge be as it be balance an account and determine on which side the odds lie if therefore either side be huddle up in haste and several of the sum that should have go into the reckon be overlook and leave out this precipitancy cause as wrong a judgment as if it be a perfect ignorance that which most commonly cause this be the prevalency of some present pleasure or pain heighten by our feeble passionate nature most strongly work on by what be present to check this precipitancy our understand and reason be give us if we will make a right use of them to search and see and then judge thereupon without liberty the understand would be to no purpose and without understand liberty if it could be would signify nothing if a man see what would do him good or harm what would make him happy or miserable without be able to move himself one step towards or from it what be he the better for see and he that be at liberty to ramble in perfect darkness what be his liberty better than if he be drive up and down as a bubble by the force of the wind the be act by a blind impulse from without or from within be little odds the first therefore and great use of liberty be to hinder blind precipitancy the principal exercise of freedom be to stand still open the eye look about and take a view of the consequence of what we be go to do as much as the weight of the matter require how much sloth and negligence heat and passion the prevalency of fashion or acquire indispositions do severally contribute on occasion to these wrong judgments i shall not here further inquire i shall only add one other false judgment which i think necessary to mention because perhaps it be little take notice of though of great influence wrong judgment of what be necessary to our happiness all men desire happiness that be past doubt but as have be already observe when they be rid of pain they be apt to take up with any pleasure at hand or that custom have endear to them to rest satisfy in that and so be happy till some new desire by make them uneasy disturb that happiness and show them that they be not so they look no further nor be the will determine to any action in pursuit of any other know or apparent good for since we find that we can not enjoy all sort of good but one exclude another we do not fix our desire on every apparent greater good unless it be judge to be necessary to our happiness if we think we can be happy without it it move us not this be another occasion to men of judge wrong when they take not that to be necessary to their happiness which really be so this mistake mislead us both in the choice of the good we aim at and very often in the mean to it when it be a remote good but which way ever it be either by place it where really it be not or by neglect the mean as not necessary to itwhen a man miss his great end happiness he will acknowledge he judge not right that which contribute to this mistake be the real or suppose unpleasantness of the action which be the way to this end it seem so preposterous a thing to men to make themselves unhappy in order to happiness that they do not easily bring themselves to it we can change the agreeableness or disagreeableness in things the last inquiry therefore concern this matter iswhether it be in a man power to change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that accompany any sort of action and as to that it be plain in many case he can men may and should correct their palates and give relish to what either have or they suppose have none the relish of the mind be as various as that of the body and like that too may be alter and it be a mistake to think that men can not change the displeasingness or indifferency that be in action into pleasure and desire if they will do but what be in their power a due consideration will do it in some case and practice application and custom in most bread or tobacco may be neglect where they be show to be useful to health because of an indifferency or disrelish to them reason and consideration at first recommend and begin their trial and use find or custom make them pleasant that this be so in virtue too be very certain action be please or displease either in themselves or consider as a mean to a greater and more desirable end the eat of a wellseasoned dish suit to a man palate may move the mind by the delight itself that accompa nies the eat without reference to any other end to which the consideration of the pleasure there be in health and strength to which that meat be subservient may add a new gusto able to make us swallow an illrelished potion in the latter of these any action be render more or less please only by the contemplation of the end and the be more or less persuade of its tendency to it or necessary connexion with it but the pleasure of the action itself be best acquire or increase by use and practice trials often reconcile us to that which at a distance we look on with aversion and by repetitions wear us into a like of what possibly in the first essay displease us habit have powerful charm and put so strong attractions of easiness and pleasure into what we accustom ourselves to that we can not forbear to do or at least be easy in the omission of action which habitual practice have suit and thereby recommend to us though this be very visible and every ones experience show him he can do so yet it be a part in the conduct of men towards their happiness neglect to a degree that it will be possibly entertain as a paradox if it be say that men can make things or action more or less please to themselves and thereby remedy that to which one may justly impute a great deal of their wander fashion and the common opinion have settle wrong notions and education and custom ill habit the just value of things be misplace and the palates of men corrupt pain should be take to rectify these and contrary habit change our pleasures and give a relish to that which be necessary or conducive to our happiness this every one must confess he can do and when happiness be lose and misery overtake him he will confess he do amiss in neglect it and condemn himself for it and i ask every one whether he have not often do so preference of vice to virtue a manifest wrong judgment i shall not now enlarge any further on the wrong judgments and neglect of what be in their power whereby men mislead themselves this would make a volume and be not my business but whatever false notions or shameful neglect of what be in their power may put men out of their way to happiness and distract them as we see into so different course of life this yet be certain that morality establish upon its true foundations can not but determine the choice in any one that will but consider and he that will not be so far a rational creature as to reflect seriously upon infinite happiness and misery must need condemn himself as not make that use of his understand he should the reward and punishments of another life which the almighty have establish as the enforcements of his law be of weight enough to determine the choice against whatever pleasure or pain this life can show when the eternal state be consider but in its bare possibility which nobody can make any doubt of he that will allow exquisite and endless happiness to be but the possible consequence of a good life here and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one must own himself to judge very much amiss if he do not concludethat a virtuous life with the certain expectation of everlasting bliss which may come be to be prefer to a vicious one with the fear of that dreadful state of misery which it be very possible may overtake the guilty or at best the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation this be evidently so though the virtuous life here have nothing but pain and the vicious continual pleasure which yet be for the most part quite otherwise and wicked men have not much the odds to brag of even in their present possession nay all things rightly consider have i think even the worse part here but when infinite happiness be put into one scale against infinite misery in the other if the worst that come to the pious man if he mistake be the best that the wicked can attain to if he be in the right who can without madness run the venture who in his wits would choose to come within a possibility of infinite misery which if he miss there be yet nothing to be get by that hazard whereas on the other side the sober man venture nothing against infinite happiness to be get if his expectation come not to pass if the good man be in the right he be eternally happy if he mistake hes not miserable he feel nothing on the other side if the wicked man be in the right he be not happy if he mistake he be infinitely miserable must it not be a most manifest wrong judg ment that do not presently see to which side in this case the preference be to be give i have forbear to mention anything of the certainty or probability of a future state design here to show the wrong judgment that any one must allow he make upon his own principles lay how he please who prefer the short pleasures of a vicious life upon any consideration whilst he know and can not but be certain that a future life be at least possible recapitulationliberty of indifferency to conclude this inquiry into human liberty which as it stand before i myself from the begin fear and a very judicious friend of mine since the publication suspect to have some mistake in it though he could not particularly show it me i be put upon a stricter review of this chapter wherein light upon a very easy and scarce observable slip i have make in put one seemingly indifferent word for another that discovery open to me this present view which here in this second edition i submit to the learn world and which in short be this liberty be a power to act or not to act accord as the mind direct a power to direct the operative faculties to motion or rest in particular instance be that which we call the will that which in the train of our voluntary action determine the will to any change of operation be some present uneasiness which be or at least be always accompany with that of desire desire be always move by evil to fly it because a total freedom from pain always make a necessary part of our happiness but every good nay every greater good do not constantly move desire because it may not make or may not be take to make part of our happiness for all that we desire be only to be happy but though this general desire of happiness operate constantly and invariably yet the satisfaction of any particular desire can be suspend from determine the will to any subservient action till we have maturely examine whether the particular apparent good which we then desire make a part of our real happiness or be consistent or inconsistent with it the result of our judgment upon that examination be what ultimately determine the man who could not be free if his will be determine by any thing but his own desire guide by his own judgment i know that liberty by some be place in an indifferency of the man antecedent to the determination of his will i wish they who lay so much stress on such an antecedent indifferency as they call it have tell us plainly whether this suppose indifferency be antecedent to the think and judgment of the understand as well as to the decree of the will for it be pretty hard to state it between them ie immediately after the judgment of the understand and before the determination of the will because the determination of the will immediately follow the judgment of the understand and to place liberty in an indifferency antecedent to the think and judgment of the understand seem to me to place liberty in a state of darkness wherein we can neither see nor say anything of it at least it place it in a subject incapable of it no agent be allow capable of liberty but in consequence of think and judgment i be not nice about phrase and therefore consent to say with those that love to speak so that liberty be place in indifferency but it be an indifferency which remain after the judgment of the understand yea even after the determination of the will and that be an indifferency not of the man for after he have once judge which be best viz to do or forbear he be no longer indifferent but an indifferency of the operative power of the man which remain equally able to operate or to forbear operate after as before the decree of the will be in a state which if one please may be call indifferency and as far as this indifferency reach a man be free and no further vg i have the ability to move my hand or to let it rest that operative power be indifferent to move or not to move my hand i be then in that respect perfectly free my will determine that operative power to rest i be yet free because the indifferency of that my operative power to act or not to act still remain the power of move my hand be not at all impair by the determination of my will which at present order rest the indifferency of that power to act or not to act be just as it be before as will appear if the will put it to the trial by order the contrary but if during the rest of my hand it be seize with a sudden palsy the indifferency of that operative power be go and with it my liberty i have no longer freedom in that respect but be under a necessity of let my hand rest on the other side if my hand be put into motion by a convulsion the indifferency of that operative faculty be take away by that motion and my liberty in that case be lose for i be under a necessity of have my hand move i have add this to show in what sort of indifferency liberty seem to me to consist and not in any other real or imaginary active and passive power in motion and in think true notions concern the nature and extent of liberty be of so great importance that i hope i shall be pardon this digression which my attempt to explain it have lead me into the ideas of will volition liberty and necessity in this chapter of power come naturally in my way in a former edition of this treatise i give an account of my thoughts concern them accord to the light i then have and now as a lover of truth and not a worshipper of my own doctrines i own some change of my opinion which i think i have discover grind for in what i first writ i with an unbiased indifferency follow truth whither i think she lead me but neither be so vain as to fancy infallibility nor so disingenuous as to dissemble my mistake for fear of blemish my reputation i have with the same sincere design for truth only not be ashamed to publish what a severer inquiry have suggest it be not impossible but that some may think my former notions right and some as i have already find these latter and some neither i shall not at all wonder at this variety in mens opinions impartial deductions of reason in controvert point be so rare and exact ones in abstract notions not so very easy especially if of any length and therefore i should think myself not a little behold to any one who would upon these or any other ground fairly clear this subject of liberty from any difficulties that may yet remain before i close this chapter it may perhaps be to our purpose and help to give us clearer conceptions about power if we make our thoughts take a little more exact survey of action i have say above that we have ideas but of two sort of action viz motion and think these in truth though call and count action yet if nearly consider will not be find to be always perfectly so for if i mistake not there be instance of both kinds which upon due consideration will be find rather passions than action and consequently so far the effect barely of passive power in those subject which yet on their account be think agents for in these instance the substance that hath motion or think receive the impression whereby it be put into that action purely from without and so act merely by the capacity it have to receive such an impression from some external agent and such power be not properly an active power but a mere passive capacity in the subject sometimes the substance or agent put itself into action by its own power and this be properly active power whatsoever modification a substance have whereby it produce any effect that be call action vg a solid substance by motion operate on or alter the sensible ideas of another substance and therefore this modification of motion we call action but yet this motion in that solid substance be when rightly consider but a passion if it receive it only from some external agent so that the active power of motion be in no substance which can not begin motion in itself or in another substance when at rest so likewise in think a power to receive ideas or thoughts from the operation of any external substance be call a power of think but this be but a passive power or capacity but to be able to bring into view ideas out of sight at ones own choice and to compare which of them one think fit this be an active power this reflection may be of some use to preserve us from mistake about power and action which grammar and the common frame of languages may be apt to lead us into since what be signify by verbs that grammarians call active do not always signify action vg this proposition i see the moon or a star or i feel the heat of the sun though express by a verb active do not signify any action in me whereby i operate on those substances but only the reception of the ideas of light roundness and heat wherein i be not active but barely passive and can not in that position of my eye or body avoid receive them but when i turn my eye another way or remove my body out of the sunbeams i be properly active because of my own choice by a power within myself i put myself into that motion such an action be the product of active power summary of our original ideas and thus i have in a short draught give a view of our original ideas from whence all the rest be derive and of which they be make up which if i would consider as a philosopher and examine on what cause they depend and of what they be make i believe they all might be reduce to these very few primary and original ones viz extension solidity mobility or the power of be move which by our sense we receive from body perceptivity or the power of perception or think motivity or the power of move which by reflection we receive from our mind i crave leave to make use of these two new word to avoid the danger of be mistake in the use of those which be equivocal to which if we add existence duration number which belong both to the one and the other we have perhaps all the original ideas on which the rest depend for by these i imagine might be explain the nature of colour sound taste smell and all other ideas we have if we have but faculties acute enough to perceive the severally modify extensions and motion of these minute body which produce those several sensations in us but my present purpose be only to inquire into the knowledge the mind have of things by those ideas and appearances which god have fit it to receive from them and how the mind come by that knowledge rather than into their cause or manner of production i shall not contrary to the design of this essay set myself to inquire philosophically into the peculiar constitution of body and the configuration of part whereby they have the power to produce in us the ideas of their sensible qualities i shall not enter any further into that disquisition it suffice to my purpose to observe that gold or saffron have a power to produce in us the idea of yellow and snow or milk the idea of white which we can only have by our sight without examine the texture of the part of those body or the particular figure or motion of the particles which rebound from them to cause in us that particular sensation though when we go beyond the bare ideas in our mind and would inquire into their cause we can not conceive anything else to be in any sensible object whereby it produce different ideas in us but the different bulk figure number texture and motion of its insensible part of mix modes mix modes what have treat of simple modes in the forego chapters and give several instance of some of the most considerable of them to show what they be and how we come by them we be now in the next place to consider those we call mix modes such be the complex ideas we mark by the name obligation drunkenness a lie c which consist of several combinations of simple ideas of different kinds i have call mix modes to distinguish them from the more simple modes which consist only of simple ideas of the same kind these mix modes be also such combinations of simple ideas as be not look upon to be characteristical mark of any real be that have a steady existence but scatter and independent ideas put together by the mind be thereby distinguish from the complex ideas of substances make by the mind that the mind in respect of its simple ideas be wholly passive and receive them all from the existence and operations of things such as sensation or reflection offer them without be able to make any one idea experience show us but if we attentively consider these ideas i call mix modes we be now speak of we shall find their original quite different the mind often exercise an active power in make these several combinations for it be once furnish with simple ideas it can put them together in several compositions and so make variety of complex ideas without examine whether they exist so together in nature and hence i think it be that these ideas be call notions as if they have their original and constant existence more in the thoughts of men than in the reality of things and to form such ideas it suffice that the mind put the part of them together and that they be consistent in the understand without consider whether they have any real be though i do not deny but several of them might be take from observation and the existence of several simple ideas so combine as they be put together in the understand for the man who first frame the idea of hypocrisy might have either take it at first from the observation of one who make show of good qualities which he have not or else have frame that idea in his mind without have any such pattern to fashion it by for it be evident that in the begin of languages and societies of men several of those complex ideas which be consequent to the constitutions establish amongst them must need have be in the mind of men before they exist anywhere else and that many name that stand for such complex ideas be in use and so those ideas frame before the combinations they stand for ever exist sometimes get by the explication of their name indeed now that languages be make and abound with word stand for such combinations an usual way of get these complex ideas be by the explication of those term that stand for them for consist of a company of simple ideas combine they may by word stand for those simple ideas be represent to the mind of one who understand those word though that complex combination of simple ideas be never offer to his mind by the real existence of things thus a man may come to have the idea of sacrilege or murder by enumerate to him the simple ideas which these word stand for without ever see either of them commit the name tie the part of mix modes into one idea every mix mode consist of many distinct simple ideas it seem reasonable to inquire whence it have its unity and how such a precise multitude come to make but one idea since that combination do not always exist together in nature to which i answer it be plain it have its unity from an act of the mind combine those several simple ideas together and consider them as one complex one consist of those part and the mark of this union or that which be look on generally to complete it be one name give to that combination for it be by their name that men commonly regulate their account of their distinct species of mix modes seldom allow or consider any number of simple ideas to make one complex one but such collections as there be name for thus though the kill of an old man be as fit in nature to be unite into one complex idea as the kill a man father yet there be no name stand precisely for the one as there be the name of parricide to mark the other it be not take for a particular complex idea nor a distinct species of action from that of kill a young man or any other man the cause of make mix modes if we should inquire a little further to see what it be that occasion men to make several combinations of simple ideas into distinct and as it be settle modes and neglect others which in the nature of things themselves have as much an aptness to be combine and make distinct ideas we shall find the reason of it to be the end of language which be to mark or communicate mens thoughts to one another with all the dispatch that may be they usually make such collections of ideas into complex modes and affix name to them as they have frequent use of in their way of live and conversation leave others which they have but seldom an occasion to mention loose and without name that tie them together they rather choose to enumerate when they have need such ideas as make them up by the particular name that stand for them than to trouble their memories by multiply of complex ideas with name to them which they seldom or never have any occasion to make use of why word in one language have none answer in another this show us how it come to pass that there be in every language many particular word which can not be render by any one single word of another for the several fashion customs and manners of one nation make several combinations of ideas familiar and necessary in one which another people have have never an occasion to make or perhaps so much as take notice of name come of course to be annex to them to avoid long periphrases in things of daily conversation and so they become so many distinct complex ideas in their mind thus ostrhakismos amongst the greeks and proscriptio amongst the romans be word which other languages have no name that exactly answer because they stand for complex ideas which be not in the mind of the men of other nations where there be no such custom there be no notion of any such action no use of such combinations of ideas as be unite and as it be tie together by those term and therefore in other countries there be no name for them and languages change hence also we may see the reason why languages constantly change take up new and lay by old term because change of customs and opinions bring with it new combinations of ideas which it be necessary frequently to think on and talk about new name to avoid long descriptions be annex to them and so they become new species of complex modes what a number of different ideas be by this mean wrap up in one short sound and how much of our time and breath be thereby save any one will see who will but take the pain to enumerate all the ideas that either reprieve or appeal stand for and instead of either of those name use a periphrasis to make any one understand their mean mix modes where they exist though i shall have occasion to consider this more at large when i come to treat of word and their use yet i could not avoid to take this much notice here of the name of mix modes which be fleet and transient combinations of simple ideas which have but a short existence anywhere but in the mind of men and there too have no longer any existence than whilst they be think on have not so much anywhere the appearance of a constant and last existence as in their name which be therefore in this sort of ideas very apt to be take for the ideas themselves for if we should inquire where the idea of a triumph or apotheosis exist it be evident they could neither of them exist altogether anywhere in the things themselves be action that require time to their performance and so could never all exist together and as to the mind of men where the ideas of these action be suppose to be lodge they have there too a very uncertain existence and therefore we be apt to annex them to the name that excite them in us how we get the ideas of mix modes there be therefore three ways whereby we get these complex ideas of mix modes by experience and observation of things themselves thus by see two men wrestle or fence we get the idea of wrestle or fence by invention or voluntary put together of several simple ideas in our own mind so he that first invent print or etch have an idea of it in his mind before it ever exist which be the most usual way by explain the name of action we never saw or motion we can not see and by enumerate and thereby as it be set before our imaginations all those ideas which go to the make them up and be the constituent part of them for have by sensation and reflection store our mind with simple ideas and by use get the name that stand for them we can by those mean represent to another any complex idea we would have him conceive so that it have in it no simple ideas but what he know and have with us the same name for for all our complex ideas be ultimately resolvable into simple ideas of which they be compound and originally make up though perhaps their immediate ingredients as i may so say be also complex ideas thus the mix mode which the word lie stand for be make of these simple ideas articulate sound certain ideas in the mind of the speaker those word the sign of those ideas those sign put together by affirmation or negation otherwise than the ideas they stand for be in the mind of the speaker i think i need not go any further in the analysis of that complex idea we call a lie what i have say be enough to show that it be make up of simple ideas and it could not be but an offensive tediousness to my reader to trouble him with a more minute enumeration of every particular simple idea that go to this complex one which from what have be say he can not but be able to make out to himself the same may be do in all our complex ideas whatsoever which however compound and decompounded may at last be resolve into simple ideas which be all the materials of knowledge or think we have or can have nor shall we have reason to fear that the mind be hereby stint to too scanty a number of ideas if we consider what an inexhaustible stock of simple modes number and figure alone afford us how far then mix modes which admit of the various combinations of different simple ideas and their infinite modes be from be few and scanty we may easily imagine so that before we have do we shall see that nobody need be afraid he shall not have scope and compass enough for his thoughts to range in though they be as i pretend confine only to simple ideas receive from sensation or reflection and their several combinations motion think and power have be most modify it be worth our observe which of all our simple ideas have be most modify and have most mix ideas make out of them with name give to them and those have be these threethinking and motion which be the two ideas which comprehend in them all action and power from whence these action be conceive to flow these simple ideas i say of think motion and power have be those which have be most modify and out of whose modifications have be make most complex modes with name to them for action be the great business of mankind and the whole matter about which all laws be conversant it be no wonder that the several modes of think and motion should be take notice of the ideas of them observe and lay up in the memory and have name assign to them without which laws could be but ill make or vice and disorder repress nor could any communication be well have amongst men without such complex ideas with name to them and therefore men have settle name and suppose settle ideas in their mind of modes of action distinguish by their cause mean object end instrument time place and other circumstances and also of their power fit for those action vg boldness be the power to speak or do what we intend before others without fear or disorder and the greeks call the confidence of speak by a peculiar name parrhesia which power or ability in man of do anything when it have be acquire by frequent do the same thing be that idea we name habit when it be forward and ready upon every occasion to break into action we call it disposition thus testiness be a disposition or aptness to be angry to conclude let us examine any modes of action vg consideration and assent which be action of the mind run and speak which be action of the body revenge and murder which be action of both together and we shall find them but so many collections of simple ideas which together make up the complex ones signify by those name several word seem to signify action signify but the effect power be the source from whence all action proceed the substances wherein these power be when they exert this power into act be call cause and the substances which thereupon be produce or the simple ideas which be introduce into any subject by the exert of that power be call effect the efficacy whereby the new substance or idea be produce be call in the subject exert that power action but in the subject wherein any simple idea be change or produce it be call passion which efficacy however various and the effect almost infinite yet we can i think conceive it in intellectual agents to be nothing else but modes of think and will in corporeal agents nothing else but modifications of motion i say i think we can not conceive it to be any other but these two for whatever sort of action besides these produce any effect i confess myself to have no notion nor idea of and so it be quite remote from my thoughts apprehensions and knowledge and as much in the dark to me as five other sense or as the ideas of colour to a blind man and therefore many word which seem to express some action signify nothing of the action or modus operandi at all but barely the effect with some circumstances of the subject work on or cause op erating vg creation annihilation contain in them no idea of the action or manner whereby they be produce but barely of the cause and the thing do and when a countryman say the cold freeze water though the word freeze seem to import some action yet truly it signify nothing but the effect viz that water that be before fluid be become hard and consistent without contain any idea of the action whereby it be do mix modes make also of other ideas than those of power and action i think i shall not need to remark here that though power and action make the greatest part of mix modes mark by name and familiar in the mind and mouth of men yet other simple ideas and their several combinations be not exclude much less i think will it be necessary for me to enumerate all the mix modes which have be settle with name to them that would be to make a dictionary of the greatest part of the word make use of in divinity ethics law and politics and several other sciences all that be requisite to my present design be to show what sort of ideas those be which i call mix modes how the mind come by them and that they be compositions make up of simple ideas get from sensation and reflection which i suppose i have do of our complex ideas of substances ideas of particular substances how make the mind be as i have declare furnish with a great number of the simple ideas convey in by the sense as they be find in exterior things or by reflection on its own operations take notice also that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together which be presume to belong to one thing and word be suit to common apprehensions and make use of for quick dispatch be call so unite in one subject by one name which by inadvertency we be apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea which indeed be a complication of many ideas together because as i have say not imagine how these simple ideas can subsist by themselves we accustom ourselves to sup pose some substratum wherein they do subsist and from which they do result which therefore we call substance our obscure idea of substance in general so that if any one will examine himself concern his notion of pure substance in general he will find he have no other idea of it at all but only a supposition of he know not what support of such qualities which be capable of produce simple ideas in us which qualities be commonly call accidents if any one should be ask what be the subject wherein colour or weight inhere he would have nothing to say but the solid extend part and if he be demand what be it that solidity and extension adhere in he would not be in a much better case than the indian before mention who say that the world be support by a great elephant be ask what the elephant rest on to which his answer wasa great tortoise but be again press to know what give support to the broadbacked tortoise repliedsomething he know not what and thus here as in all other case where we use word without have clear and distinct ideas we talk like children who be question what such a thing be which they know not readily give this satisfactory answer that it be something which in truth signify no more when so use either by children or men but that they know not what and that the thing they pretend to know and talk of be what they have no distinct idea of at all and so be perfectly ignorant of it and in the dark the idea then we have to which we give the general name substance be nothing but the suppose but unknown support of those qualities we find exist which we imagine can not subsist sine re substante without something to support them we call that support substantia which accord to the true import of the word be in plain english stand under or uphold of the sort of substances an obscure and relative idea of substance in general be thus make we come to have the ideas of particular sort of substances by collect such combinations of simple ideas as be by experience and observation of mens sense take notice of to exist together and be therefore suppose to flow from the particular internal constitution or un know essence of that substance thus we come to have the ideas of a man horse gold water c of which substances whether any one have any other clear idea further than of certain simple ideas coexistent together i appeal to every ones own experience it be the ordinary qualities observable in iron or a diamond put together that make the true complex idea of those substances which a smith or a jeweller commonly know better than a philosopher who whatever substantial form he may talk of have no other idea of those substances than what be frame by a collection of those simple ideas which be to be find in them only we must take notice that our complex ideas of substances besides all those simple ideas they be make up of have always the confuse idea of something to which they belong and in which they subsist and therefore when we speak of any sort of substance we say it be a thing have such or such qualities as body be a thing that be extend figure and capable of motion spirit a thing capable of think and so hardness friability and power to draw iron we say be qualities to be find in a loadstone these and the like fashion of speak intimate that the substance be suppose always something besides the extension figure solidity motion think or other observable ideas though we know not what it be no clear or distinct idea of substance in general hence when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substances as horse stone c though the idea we have of either of them be but the complication or collection of those several simple ideas of sensible qualities which we use to find unite in the thing call horse or stone yet because we can not conceive how they should subsist alone nor one in another we suppose them exist in and support by some common subject which support we denote by the name substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support as clear an idea of spiritual substance as of corporeal substance the same thing happen concern the operations of the mind viz think reason fear c which we conclude not to subsist of themselves nor apprehend how they can belong to body or be produce by it we be apt to think these the action of some other substance which we call spirit whereby yet it be evident that have no other idea or notion of matter but something wherein those many sensible qualities which affect our sense do subsist by suppose a substance wherein think know doubt and a power of move c do subsist we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body the one be suppose to be without know what it be the substratum to those simple ideas we have from without and the other suppose with a like ignorance of what it be to be the substratum to those operations we experiment in ourselves within it be plain then that the idea of corporeal substance in matter be as remote from our conceptions and apprehensions as that of spiritual substance or spirit and therefore from our not have any notion of the substance of spirit we can no more conclude its nonexistence than we can for the same reason deny the existence of body it be as rational to affirm there be no body because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter as to say there be no spirit because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of a spirit our ideas of particular sort of substances whatever therefore be the secret abstract nature of substance in general all the ideas we have of particular distinct sort of substances be nothing but several combinations of simple ideas coexist in such though unknown cause of their union as make the whole subsist of itself it be by such combinations of simple ideas and nothing else that we represent particular sort of substances to ourselves such be the ideas we have of their several species in our mind and such only do we by their specific name signify to others vg man horse sun water iron upon hear which word every one who understand the language frame in his mind a combination of those several simple ideas which he have usually observe or fancy to exist together under that denomination all which he suppose to rest in and be as it be adherent to that unknown common subject which inhere not in anything else though in the meantime it be manifest and every one upon inquiry into his own thoughts will find that he have no other idea of any substance vg let it be gold horse iron man vitriol bread but what he have barely of those sensible qualities which he suppose to inhere with a supposition of such a substratum as give as it be a support to those qualities or simple ideas which he have observe to exist unite together thus the idea of the sun what be it but an aggregate of those several simple ideas bright hot roundish have a constant regular motion at a certain distance from us and perhaps some other as he who think and discourse of the sun have be more or less accurate in observe those sensible qualities ideas or properties which be in that thing which he call the sun their active and passive power a great part of our complex ideas of substances for he have the perfectest idea of any of the particular sort of substances who have gather and put together most of those simple ideas which do exist in it among which be to be reckon its active power and passive capacities which though not simple ideas yet in this respect for brevitys sake may conveniently enough be reckon amongst them thus the power of draw iron be one of the ideas of the complex one of that substance we call a loadstone and a power to be so draw be a part of the complex one we call iron which power pass for inherent qualities in those subject because every substance be as apt by the power we observe in it to change some sensible qualities in other subject as it be to produce in us those simple ideas which we receive immediately from it do by those new sensible qualities introduce into other subject discover to us those power which do thereby mediately affect our sense as regularly as its sensible qualities do it immediately vg we immediately by our sense perceive in fire its heat and colour which be if rightly consider nothing but power in it to produce those ideas in us we also by our sense perceive the colour and brittleness of charcoal whereby we come by the knowledge of another power in fire which it have to change the colour and consistency of wood by the former fire immediately by the latter it mediately discover to us these several power which therefore we look upon to be a part of the qualities of fire and so make them a part of the complex idea of it for all those power that we take cognizance of terminate only in the alteration of some sensible qualities in those subject on which they operate and so make them exhibit to us new sensible ideas therefore it be that i have reckon these power amongst the simple ideas which make the complex ones of the sort of substances though these power consider in themselves be truly complex ideas and in this looser sense i crave leave to be understand when i name any of these potentialities among the simple ideas which we recollect in our mind when we think of particular substances for the power that be severally in them be necessary to be consider if we will have true distinct notions of the several sort of substances and why nor be we to wonder that power make a great part of our complex ideas of substances since their secondary qualities be those which in most of them serve principally to distinguish substances one from another and commonly make a considerable part of the complex idea of the several sort of them for our sense fail us in the discovery of the bulk texture and figure of the minute part of body on which their real constitutions and differences depend we be fain to make use of their secondary qualities as the characteristical note and mark whereby to frame ideas of them in our mind and distinguish them one from another all which secondary qualities as have be show be nothing but bare power for the colour and taste of opium be as well as its soporific or anodyne virtues mere power depend on its primary qualities whereby it be fit to produce different operations on different part of our body three sort of ideas make our complex ones of corporeal substances the ideas that make our complex ones of corporeal substances be of these three sort first the ideas of the primary qualities of things which be discover by our sense and be in them even when we perceive them not such be the bulk figure number situation and motion of the part of body which be really in them whether we take notice of them or not secondly the sensible secondary qualities which depend on these be nothing but the power those substances have to produce several ideas in us by our sense which ideas be not in the things themselves otherwise than as anything be in its cause thirdly the aptness we consider in any substance to give or receive such alterations of primary qualities as that the substance so alter should produce in us different ideas from what it do before these be call active and passive power all which power as far as we have any notice or notion of them terminate only in sensible simple ideas for whatever alteration a loadstone have the power to make in the minute particles of iron we should have no notion of any power it have at all to operate on iron do not its sensible motion discover it and i doubt not but there be a thousand change that body we daily handle have a power to use in one another which we never suspect because they never appear in sensible effect power thus make a great part of our complex ideas of particular substances power therefore justly make a great part of our complex ideas of substances he that will examine his complex idea of gold will find several of its ideas that make it up to be only power as the power of be melt but of not spend itself in the fire of be dissolve in aqua regia be ideas as necessary to make up our complex idea of gold as its colour and weight which if duly consider be also nothing but different power for to speak truly yellowness be not actually in gold but be a power in gold to produce that idea in us by our eye when place in a due light and the heat which we can not leave out of our ideas of the sun be no more really in the sun than the white colour it introduce into wax these be both equally power in the sun operate by the motion and figure of its sensible part so on a man as to make him have the idea of heat and so on wax as to make it capable to produce in a man the idea of white the now secondary qualities of body would disappear if we could discover the primary ones of their minute part have we sense acute enough to discern the minute particles of body and the real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend i doubt not but they would produce quite different ideas in us and that which be now the yellow colour of gold would then disappear and instead of it we should see an admirable texture of part of a certain size and figure this microscopes plainly discover to us for what to our naked eye produce a certain colour be by thus augment the acuteness of our sense discover to be quite a different thing and the thus alter as it be the proportion of the bulk of the minute part of a colour object to our usual sight produce different ideas from what it do before thus sand or pound glass which be opaque and white to the naked eye be pellucid in a microscope and a hair see in this way lose its former colour and be in a great measure pellucid with a mixture of some bright sparkle colour such as appear from the refraction of diamonds and other pellucid body blood to the naked eye appear all red but by a good microscope wherein its lesser part appear show only some few globules of red swim in a pellucid liquor and how these red globules would appear if glass could be find that could yet magnify them a thousand or ten thousand time more be uncertain our faculties for discovery of the qualities and power of substances suit to our state the infinite wise contriver of us and all things about us hath fit our sense faculties and organs to the conveniences of life and the business we have to do here we be able by our sense to know and distinguish things and to examine them so far as to apply them to our use and several ways to accommodate the exigences of this life we have insight enough into their admirable contrivances and wonderful effect to admire and magnify the wisdom power and goodness of their author such a knowledge as this which be suit to our present condition we want not faculties to attain but it appear not that god intend we should have a perfect clear and adequate knowledge of them that perhaps be not in the comprehension of any finite be we be furnish with faculties dull and weak as they be to discover enough in the creatures to lead us to the knowledge of the creator and the knowledge of our duty and we be fit well enough with abilities to provide for the conveniences of live these be our business in this world but be our sense alter and make much quicker and acuter the appearance and outward scheme of things would have quite another face to us and i be apt to think would be inconsistent with our be or at least wellbeing in this part of the universe which we inhabit he that consider how little our constitution be able to bear a remove into part of this air not much higher than that we commonly breath in will have reason to be satisfy that in this globe of earth allot for our mansion the allwise architect have suit our organs and the body that be to affect them one to another if our sense of hear be but a thousand time quicker than it be how would a perpetual noise distract us and we should in the quietest retirement be less able to sleep or meditate than in the middle of a seafight nay if that most instructive of our sense see be in any man a thousand or a hundred thousand time more acute than it be by the best microscope things several millions of time less than the smallest object of his sight now would then be visible to his naked eye and so he would come nearer to the discovery of the texture and motion of the minute part of corporeal things and in many of them probably get ideas of their internal constitutions but then he would be in a quite different world from other people nothing would appear the same to him and others the visible ideas of everything would be different so that i doubt whether he and the rest of men could discourse concern the object of sight or have any communication about colour their appearances be so wholly different and perhaps such a quickness and tenderness of sight could not endure bright sunshine or so much as open daylight nor take in but a very small part of any object at once and that too only at a very near distance and if by the help of such microscopical eye if i may so call them a man could penetrate further than ordinary into the secret composition and radical texture of body he would not make any great advantage by the change if such an acute sight would not serve to conduct him to the market and exchange if he could not see things he be to avoid at a convenient distance nor distinguish things he have to do with by those sensible qualities others do he that be sharpsighted enough to see the configuration of the minute particles of the spring of a clock and observe upon what peculiar structure and impulse its elastic motion depend would no doubt discover something very admirable but if eye so frame could not view at once the hand and the character of the hourplate and thereby at a distance see what oclock it be their owner could not be much benefit by that acuteness which whilst it discover the secret contrivance of the part of the machine make him lose its use conjecture about the corporeal organs of some spirit and here give me leave to propose an extravagant conjecture of mine viz that since we have some reason if there be any credit to be give to the report of things that our philosophy can not account for to imagine that spirit can assume to themselves body of different bulk figure and conformation of partswhether one great advantage some of them have over us may not lie in this that they can so frame and shape to themselves organs of sensation or perception as to suit them to their present design and the circumstances of the object they would consider for how much would that man exceed all others in knowledge who have but the faculty so to alter the structure of his eye that one sense as to make it capable of all the several degrees of vision which the assistance of glass casually at first light on have teach us to conceive what wonder would he discover who could so fit his eye to all sort of object as to see when he please the figure and motion of the minute particles in the blood and other juices of animals as distinctly as he do at other time the shape and motion of the animals themselves but to us in our present state unalterable organs so contrive as to discover the figure and motion of the minute part of body whereon depend those sensible qualities we now observe in them would perhaps be of no advantage god have no doubt make them so as be best for us in our present condition he hath fit us for the neighbourhood of the body that surround us and we have to do with and though we can not by the facul tie we have attain to a perfect knowledge of things yet they will serve us well enough for those end abovementioned which be our great concernment i beg my readers pardon for lay before him so wild a fancy concern the ways of perception of be above us but how extravagant soever it be i doubt whether we can imagine anything about the knowledge of angels but after this manner some way or other in proportion to what we find and observe in ourselves and though we can not but allow that the infinite power and wisdom of god may frame creatures with a thousand other faculties and ways of perceive things without them than what we have yet our thoughts can go no further than our own so impossible it be for us to enlarge our very guess beyond the ideas receive from our own sensation and reflection the supposition at least that angels do sometimes assume body need not startle us since some of the most ancient and most learn father of the church seem to believe that they have body and this be certain that their state and way of existence be unknown to us our specific ideas of substances but to return to the matter in handthe ideas we have of substances and the ways we come by them i say our specific ideas of substances be nothing else but a collection of a certain number of simple ideas consider as unite in one thing these ideas of substances though they be commonly simple apprehensions and the name of them simple term yet in effect be complex and compound thus the idea which an englishman signify by the name swan be white colour long neck red beak black legs and whole feet and all these of a certain size with a power of swim in the water and make a certain kind of noise and perhaps to a man who have long observe this kind of bird some other properties which all terminate in sensible simple ideas all unite in one common subject our ideas of spiritual substances as clear as of bodily substances besides the complex ideas we have of material sensible substances of which i have last speak by the simple ideas we have take from those operations of our own mind which we experiment daily in our selves as think understand will know and power of begin motion c coexist in some substance we be able to frame the complex idea of an immaterial spirit and thus by put together the ideas of think perceive liberty and power of move themselves and other things we have as clear a perception and notion of immaterial substances as we have of material for put together the ideas of think and will or the power of move or quiet corporeal motion join to substance of which we have no distinct idea we have the idea of an immaterial spirit and by put together the ideas of coherent solid part and a power of be move join with substance of which likewise we have no positive idea we have the idea of matter the one be as clear and distinct an idea as the other the idea of think and move a body be as clear and distinct ideas as the ideas of extension solidity and be move for our idea of substance be equally obscure or none at all in both it be but a suppose i know not what to support those ideas we call accidents it be for want reflection that we be apt to think that our sense show us nothing but material things every act of sensation when duly consider give us an equal view of both part of nature the corporeal and spiritual for whilst i know by see or hear c that there be some corporeal be without me the object of that sensation i do more certainly know that there be some spiritual be within me that see and hear this i must be convince can not be the action of bare insensible matter nor ever could be without an immaterial think be no idea of abstract substance either in body or spirit by the complex idea of extend figure colour and all other sensible qualities which be all that we know of it we be as far from the idea of the substance of body as if we know nothing at all nor after all the acquaintance and familiarity which we imagine we have with matter and the many qualities men assure themselves they perceive and know in body will it perhaps upon examination be find that they have any more or clearer primary ideas belong to body than they have belong to immaterial spirit cohesion of solid part and impulse the primary ideas peculiar to body the primary ideas we have peculiar to body as contradistinguish to spirit be the cohesion of solid and consequently separable part and a power of communicate motion by impulse these i think be the original ideas proper and peculiar to body for figure be but the consequence of finite extension think and motivity the primary ideas peculiar to spirit the ideas we have belong and peculiar to spirit be think and will or a power of put body into motion by think and which be consequent to it liberty for as body can not but communicate its motion by impulse to another body which it meet with at rest so the mind can put body into motion or forbear to do so as it please the ideas of existence duration and mobility be common to them both spirit capable of motion there be no reason why it should be think strange that i make mobility belong to spirit for have no other idea of motion but change of distance with other be that be consider as at rest and find that spirit as well as body can not operate but where they be and that spirit do operate at several time in several place i can not but attribute change of place to all finite spirit for of the infinite spirit i speak not here for my soul be a real be as well as my body be certainly as capable of change distance with any other body or be as body itself and so be capable of motion and if a mathematician can consider a certain distance or a change of that distance between two point one may certainly conceive a distance and a change of distance between two spirit and so conceive their motion their approach or removal one from another proof of this every one find in himself that his soul can think will and operate on his body in the place where that be but can not operate on a body or in a place an hundred miles distant from it nobody can imagine that his soul can think or move a body at oxford whilst he be at london and can not but know that be unite to his body it constantly change place all the whole journey between oxford and london as the coach or horse do that carry him and i think may be say to be truly all that while in motion or if that will not be allow to afford us a clear idea enough of its motion its be separate from the body in death i think will for to consider it as go out of the body or leave it and yet to have no idea of its motion seem to me impossible god immoveable because infinite if it be say by any one that it can not change place because it hath none for the spirit be not in loco but ubi i suppose that way of talk will not now be of much weight to many in an age that be not much dispose to admire or suffer themselves to be deceive by such unintelligible ways of speak but if any one think there be any sense in that distinction and that it be applicable to our present purpose i desire him to put it into intelligible english and then from thence draw a reason to show that immaterial spirit be not capable of motion indeed motion can not be attribute to god not because he be an immaterial but because he be an infinite spirit our complex idea of an immaterial spirit and our complex idea of body compare let us compare then our complex idea of an immaterial spirit with our complex idea of body and see whether there be any more obscurity in one than in the other and in which most our idea of body as i think be an extend solid substance capable of communicate motion by impulse and our idea of soul as an immaterial spirit be of a substance that think and have a power of excite motion in body by will or think these i think be our complex ideas of soul and body as contradistinguish and now let us examine which have most obscurity in it and difficulty to be apprehend i know that people whose thoughts be immerse in matter and have so subject their mind to their sense that they seldom reflect on anything beyond them be apt to say they can not comprehend a think thing which perhaps be true but i affirm when they consider it well they can no more comprehend an extend thing cohesion of solid part in body as hard to be conceive as think in a soul if any one say he know not what it be think in him he mean he know not what the substance be of that think thing no more say i know he what the substance be of that solid thing further if he say he know not how he think i answer neither know he how he be extend how the solid part of body be unite or cohere together to make extension for though the pressure of the particles of air may account for the cohesion of several part of matter that be grosser than the particles of air and have pore less than the corpuscles of air yet the weight or pressure of the air will not explain nor can be a cause of the coherence of the particles of air themselves and if the pressure of the aether or any subtiler matter than the air may unite and hold fast together the part of a particle of air as well as other body yet it can not make bond for itself and hold together the part that make up every the least corpuscle of that materia subtilis so that that hypothesis how ingeniously soever explain by show that the part of sensible body be hold together by the pressure of other external insensible body reach not the part of the aether itself and by how much the more evident it prove that the part of other body be hold together by the external pressure of the aether and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion and union by so much the more it leave us in the dark concern the cohesion of the part of the corpuscles of the aether itself which we can neither conceive without part they be body and divisible nor yet how their part cohere they want that cause of cohesion which be give of the cohesion of the part of all other body not explain by an ambient fluid but in truth the pressure of any ambient fluid how great soever can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid part of matter for though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polish superficies one from another in a line perpendicular to them as in the experiment of two polish marble yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion in a line parallel to those surface because the ambient fluid have a full liberty to succeed in each point of space desert by a lateral motion resist such a motion of body so join no more than it would resist the motion of that body be it on all side environ by that fluid and touch no other body and therefore if there be no other cause of cohesion all part of body must be easily separable by such a lateral slide motion for if the pressure of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion wherever that cause operate not there can be no cohesion and since it can not operate against a lateral separation as have be show therefore in every imaginary plane intersect any mass of matter there could be no more cohesion than of two polish surface which will always notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid easily slide one from another so that perhaps how clear an idea soever we think we have of the extension of body which be nothing but the cohesion of solid part he that shall well consider it in his mind may have reason to conclude that it be as easy for him to have a clear idea how the soul think as how body be extend for since body be no further nor otherwise extend than by the union and cohesion of its solid part we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body without understand wherein consist the union and cohesion of its part which seem to me as incomprehensible as the manner of think and how it be perform we can as little understand how the part cohere in extension as how our spirit perceive or move i allow it be usual for most people to wonder how any one should find a difficulty in what they think they every day observe do we not see will they be ready to say the part of body stick firmly together be there anything more common and what doubt can there be make of it and the like i say concern think and voluntary motion do we not every moment experiment it in ourselves and therefore can it be doubt the matter of fact be clear i confess but when we would a little nearer look into it and consider how it be do there i think we be at a loss both in the one and the other and can as little understand how the part of body cohere as how we ourselves perceive or move i would have any one intelligibly explain to me how the part of gold or brass that but now in fusion be as loose from one another as the particles of water or the sand of an hourglass come in a few moments to be so unite and adhere so strongly one to another that the utmost force of mens arm can not separate them a consider man will i suppose be here at a loss to satisfy his own or another man understand the cause of coherence of atoms in extend substances incomprehensible the little body that compose that fluid we call water be so extremely small that i have never hear of any one who by a microscope and yet i have hear of some that have magnify to ten thousand nay to much above a hundred thousand time pretend to perceive their distinct bulk figure or motion and the particles of water be also so perfectly loose one from another that the least force sensibly separate them nay if we consider their perpetual motion we must allow them to have no cohesion one with another and yet let but a sharp cold come and they unite they consolidate these little atoms cohere and be not without great force separable he that could find the bond that tie these heap of loose little body together so firmly he that could make know the cement that make them stick so fast one to another would discover a great and yet unknown secret and yet when that be do would he be far enough from make the extension of body which be the cohesion of its solid part intelligible till he could show wherein consist the union or consolidation of the part of those bond or of that cement or of the least particle of matter that exist whereby it appear that this primary and suppose obvious quality of body will be find when examine to be as incomprehensible as anything belong to our mind and a solid extend substance as hard to be conceive as a think immaterial one whatever difficulties some would raise against it the suppose pressure bring to explain cohesion be unintelligible for to extend our thoughts a little further that pressure which be bring to explain the cohesion of body be as unintelligible as the cohesion itself for if matter be consider as no doubt it be finite let any one send his contemplation to the extremities of the universe and there see what conceivable hoop what bond he can imagine to hold this mass of matter in so close a pressure together from whence steel have its firmness and the part of a diamond their hardness and indissolubility if matter be finite it must have its extremes and there must be something to hinder it from scatter asunder if to avoid this difficulty any one will throw himself into the supposition and aby of infinite matter let him consider what light he thereby bring to the cohesion of body and whether he be ever the nearer make it intelligible by resolve it into a supposition the most absurd and most incomprehensible of all other so far be our extension of body which be nothing but the cohesion of solid part from be clearer or more distinct when we would inquire into the nature cause or manner of it than the idea of think communication of motion by impulse or by think equally unintelligible another idea we have of body be the power of communication of motion by impulse and of our souls the power of excite motion by think these ideas the one of body the other of our mind every days experience clearly furnish us with but if here again we inquire how this be do we be equally in the dark for in the communication of motion by impulse wherein as much motion be lose to one body as be get to the other which be the ordinariest case we can have no other conception but of the pass of motion out of one body into another which i think be as obscure and inconceivable as how our mind move or stop our body by think which we every moment find they do the increase of motion by impulse which be observe or believe sometimes to happen be yet harder to be understand we have by daily experience clear evidence of motion produce both by impulse and by think but the manner how hardly come within our comprehension we be equally at a loss in both so that however we consider motion and its communication either from body or spirit the idea which belong to spirit be at least as clear as that which belong to body and if we consider the active power of move or as i may call it motivity it be much clearer in spirit than body since two body place by one another at rest will never afford us the idea of a power in the one to move the other but by a borrow motion whereas the mind every day afford us ideas of an active power of move of body and therefore it be worth our consideration whether active power be not the proper attribute of spirit and passive power of matter hence may be conjecture that create spirit be not totally separate from matter because they be both active and passive pure spirit viz god be only active pure matter be only passive those be that be both active and passive we may judge to partake of both but be that as it will i think we have as many and as clear ideas belong to spirit as we have belong to body the substance of each be equally unknown to us and the idea of think in spirit as clear as of extension in body and the communication of motion by think which we attribute to spirit be as evident as that by impulse which we ascribe to body constant experience make us sensible of both these though our narrow understand can comprehend neither for when the mind would look beyond those original ideas we have from sensation or reflection and penetrate into their cause and manner of production we find still it discover nothing but its own shortsightedness summary to conclude sensation convince us that there be solid extend substances and reflection that there be think ones experience assure us of the existence of such be and that the one hath a power to move body by impulse the other by think this we can not doubt of experience i say every moment furnish us with the clear ideas both of the one and the other but beyond these ideas as receive from their proper source our faculties will not reach if we would inquire further into their nature cause and manner we perceive not the nature of extension clearer than we do of think if we would explain them any further one be as easy as the other and there be no more difficulty to conceive how a substance we know not should by think set body into motion than how a substance we know not should by impulse set body into motion so that we be no more able to discover wherein the ideas belong to body consist than those belong to spirit from whence it seem probable to me that the simple ideas we receive from sensation and reflection be the boundaries of our thoughts beyond which the mind whatever efforts it would make be not able to advance one jot nor can it make any discoveries when it would pry into the nature and hide cause of those ideas our idea of spirit and our idea of body compare so that in short the idea we have of spirit compare with the idea we have of body stand thus the substance of spirit be unknown to us and so be the substance of body equally unknown to us two primary qualities or properties of body viz solid coherent part and impulse we have distinct clear ideas of so likewise we know and have distinct clear ideas of two primary qualities or properties of spirit viz think and a power of action ie a power of begin or stop several thoughts or motion we have also the ideas of several qualities inherent in body and have the clear distinct ideas of them which qualities be but the various modifications of the extension of cohere solid part and their motion we have likewise the ideas of the several modes of think viz believe doubt intend fear hop all which be but the several modes of think we have also the ideas of will and move the body consequent to it and with the body itself too for as have be show spirit be capable of motion the notion of spirit involve no more difficulty in it than that of body lastly if this notion of immaterial spirit may have perhaps some difficulties in it not easily to be explain we have therefore no more reason to deny or doubt the existence of such spirit than we have to deny or doubt the existence of body because the notion of body be cumber with some difficulties very hard and perhaps impossible to be explain or understand by us for i would fain have instance anything in our notion of spirit more perplex or nearer a contradiction than the very notion of body include in it the divisibility in infinitum of any finite extension involve us whether we grant or deny it in consequences impossible to be explicate or make in our apprehensions consistent consequences that carry greater difficulty and more apparent absurdity than anything can follow from the notion of an immaterial know substance we know nothing of things beyond our simple ideas of them which we be not at all to wonder at since we have but some few superficial ideas of things discover to us only by the sense from without or by the mind reflect on what it experiment in itself within have no knowledge beyond that much less of the internal constitution and true nature of things be destitute of faculties to attain it and therefore experiment and discover in ourselves knowledge and the power of voluntary motion as certainly as we experiment or discover in things without us the cohesion and separation of solid part which be the extension and motion of body we have as much reason to be satisfy with our notion of immaterial spirit as with our notion of body and the existence of the one as well as the other for it be no more a contradiction that think should exist separate and independent from solidity than it be a contradiction that solidity should exist separate and independent from think they be both but simple ideas independent one from another and have as clear and distinct ideas in us of think as of solidity i know not why we may not as well allow a think thing without solidity ie immaterial to exist as a solid thing without think ie matter to exist especially since it be not harder to conceive how think should exist without matter than how matter should think for whensoever we would proceed beyond these simple ideas we have from sensation and reflection and dive further into the nature of things we fall presently into darkness and obscurity perplexedness and difficulties and can discover nothing further but our own blindness and ignorance but whichever of these complex ideas be clearest that of body or immaterial spirit this be evident that the simple ideas that make them up be no other than what we have receive from sensation or reflection and so be it of all our other ideas of substances even of god himself our complex idea of god for if we examine the idea we have of the incomprehensible supreme be we shall find that we come by it the same way and that the complex ideas we have both of god and separate spirit be make of the simple ideas we receive from reflection vg have from what we experiment in ourselves get the ideas of existence and duration of knowledge and power of pleasure and happiness and of several other qualities and power which it be better to have than to be without when we would frame an idea the most suitable we can to the supreme be we enlarge every one of these with our idea of infinity and so put them together make our complex idea of god for that the mind have such a power of enlarge some of its ideas receive from sensation and reflection have be already show our complex idea of god as infinite if i find that i know some few things and some of them or all perhaps imperfectly i can frame an idea of know twice as many which i can double again as often as i can add to number and thus enlarge my idea of knowledge by extend its comprehension to all things exist or possible the same also i can do of know them more perfectly ie all their qualities power cause consequences and relations c till all be perfectly know that be in them or can any way relate to them and thus frame the idea of infinite or boundless knowledge the same may also be do of power till we come to that we call infinite and also of the duration of existence without begin or end and so frame the idea of an eternal be the degrees or extent wherein we ascribe existence power wisdom and all other perfections which we can have any ideas of to that sovereign be which we call god be all boundless and infinite we frame the best idea of him our mind be capable of all which be do i say by enlarge those simple ideas we have take from the operations of our own mind by reflection or by our sense from exterior things to that vastness to which infinity can extend them god in his own essence incognisable for it be infinity which join to our ideas of existence power knowledge c make that complex idea whereby we represent to ourselves the best we can the supreme be for though in his own essence which certainly we do not know not know the real essence of a pebble or a fly or of our own selves god be simple and uncompounded yet i think i may say we have no other idea of him but a complex one of existence knowledge power happiness c infinite and eternal which be all distinct ideas and some of them be relative be again compound of others all which be as have be show originally get from sensation and reflection go to make up the idea or notion we have of god no ideas in our complex ideas of spirit but those get from sensation or reflection this further be to be observe that there be no idea we attribute to god bat infinity which be not also a part of our complex idea of other spirit because be capable of no other simple ideas belong to anything but body but those which by reflection we receive from the operation of our own mind we can attribute to spirit no other but what we receive from thence and all the difference we can put between them in our contemplation of spirit be only in the several extents and degrees of their knowledge power duration happiness c for that in our ideas as well of spirit as of other things we be restrain to those we receive from sensation and reflection be evident from hencethat in our ideas of spirit how much soever advance in perfection beyond those of body even to that of infinite we can not yet have any idea of the manner wherein they discover their thoughts one to another though we must necessarily conclude that separate spirit which be be that have perfecter knowledge and greater happiness than we must need have also a perfecter way of communicate their thoughts than we have who be fain to make use of corporeal sign and particular sound which be therefore of most general use as be the best and quickest we be capable of but of immediate communication have no experiment in ourselves and consequently no notion of it at all we have no idea how spirit which use not word can with quickness or much less how spirit that have no body can be master of their own thoughts and communicate or conceal them at pleasure though we can not but necessarily suppose they have such a power recapitulation and thus we have see what kind of ideas we have of substances of all kinds wherein they consist and how we come by them from whence i think it be very evident first that all our ideas of the several sort of substances be nothing but collections of simple ideas with a supposition of something to which they belong and in which they subsist though of this suppose something we have no clear distinct idea at all secondly that all the simple ideas that thus unite in one common substratum make up our complex ideas of several sort of substances be no other but such as we have receive from sensation or reflection so that even in those which we think we be most intimately acquaint with and that come nearest the comprehension of our most enlarge conceptions we can not go beyond those simple ideas and even in those which seem most remote from all we have to do with and do infinitely surpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by reflection or discover by sensation in other things we can attain to nothing but those simple ideas which we originally receive from sensation or reflection as be evident in the complex ideas we have of angels and particularly of god himself thirdly that most of the simple ideas that make up our complex ideas of substances when truly consider be only power however we be apt to take them for positive qualities vg the greatest part of the ideas that make our complex idea of gold be yellowness great weight ductility fusibility and solubility in aqua regia c all unite together in an unknown substratum all which ideas be nothing else but so many relations to other substances and be not really in the gold consider barely in itself though they depend on those real and primary qualities of its internal constitution whereby it have a fitness differently to operate and be operate on by several other substances of collective ideas of substances a collective idea be one idea besides these complex ideas of several single substances as of man horse gold violet apple c the mind hath also complex collective ideas of substances which i so call because such ideas be make up of many particular substances consider together as unite into one idea and which so join be look on as one vg the idea of such a collection of men as make an army though consist of a great number of distinct substances be as much one idea as the idea of a man and the great collective idea of all body whatsoever signify by the name world be as much one idea as the idea of any the least particle of matter in it it suffice to the unity of any idea that it be consider as one representation or picture though make up of ever so many particulars make by the power of compose in the mind these collective ideas of substances the mind make by its power of composition and unite severally either simple or complex ideas into one as it do by the same faculty make the complex ideas of particular substances consist of an aggregate of divers simple ideas unite in one substance and as the mind by put together the repeat ideas of unity make the collective mode or complex idea of any number as a score or a gross cso by put together several particular substances it make collective ideas of substances as a troop an army a swarm a city a fleet each of which every one find that he represent to his own mind by one idea in one view and so under that notion consider those several things as perfectly one as one ship or one atom nor be it harder to conceive how an army of ten thousand men should make one idea than how a man should make one idea it be as easy to the mind to unite into one the idea of a great number of men and consider it as one as it be to unite into one particular all the distinct ideas that make up the composition of a man and consider them all together as one artificial things that be make up of distinct substances be our collective ideas amongst such kind of collective ideas be to be count most part of artificial things at least such of them as be make up of distinct substances and in truth if we consider all these collective ideas aright as army constellation universe as they be unite into so many single ideas they be but the artificial draught of the mind bring things very remote and independent on one another into one view the better to contemplate and discourse of them unite into one conception and signify by one name for there be no things so remote nor so contrary which the mind can not by this art of composition bring into one idea as be visible in that signify by the name universe of relation relation what besides the ideas whether simple or complex that the mind have of things as they be in themselves there be others it get from their comparison one with another the understand in the consideration of anything be not confine to that precise object it can carry an idea as it be beyond itself or at least look beyond it to see how it stand in conformity to any other when the mind so consider one thing that it do as it be bring it to and set it by another and carry its view from one to the otherthis be as the word import relation and respect and the denominations give to positive things intimate that respect and serve as mark to lead the thoughts beyond the subject itself denominate to something distinct from it be what we call relatives and the things so bring together relate thus when the mind consider caius as such a positive be it take nothing into that idea but what really exist in caius vg when i consider him as a man i have nothing in my mind but the complex idea of the species man so likewise when i say caius be a white man i have nothing but the bare consideration of a man who hath that white colour but when i give caius the name husband i intimate some other person and when i give him the name whiter i intimate some other thing in both case my think be lead to something beyond caius and there be two things bring into consideration and since any idea whether simple or complex may be the occasion why the mind thus bring two things together and as it be take a view of them at once though still consider as distinct therefore any of our ideas may be the foundation of relation as in the abovementioned instance the contract and ceremony of marriage with sempronia be the occasion of the denomination and relation of husband and the colour white the occasion why he be say to be whiter than freestone ideas of relations without correlative term not easily apprehend these and the like relations express by relative term that have others answer them with a reciprocal intimation as father and son bigger and less cause and effect be very obvious to every one and everybody at first sight perceive the relation for father and son husband and wife and such other correlative term seem so nearly to belong one to another and through custom do so readily chime and answer one another in people memories that upon the name of either of them the thoughts be presently carry beyond the thing so name and nobody overlook or doubt of a relation where it be so plainly intimate but where languages have fail to give correlative name there the relation be not always so easily take notice of concubine be no doubt a relative name as well as a wife but in languages where this and the like word have not a correlative term there people be not so apt to take them to be so as want that evident mark of relation which be between correlatives which seem to explain one another and not to be able to exist but together hence it be that many of those name which duly consider do include evident relations have be call external denominations but all name that be more than empty sound must signify some idea which be either in the thing to which the name be apply and then it be positive and be look on as unite to and exist in the thing to which the denomination be give or else it arise from the respect the mind find in it to something distinct from it with which it consider it and then it include a relation some seemingly absolute term contain relations another sort of relative term there be which be not look on to be either relative or so much as external denominations which yet under the form and appearance of signify something absolute in the subject do conceal a tacit though less observable relation such be the seemingly positive term of old great imperfect c whereof i shall have occasion to speak more at large in the follow chapters relation different from the things relate this further may be observe that the ideas of relation may be the same in men who have far different ideas of the things that be relate or that be thus compare vg those who have far different ideas of a man may yet agree in the notion of a father which be a notion superinduced to the substance or man and refer only to an act of that thing call man whereby he contribute to the generation of one of his own kind let man be what it will change of relation may be without any change in the things relate the nature therefore of relation consist in the refer or compare two things one to another from which comparison one or both come to be denominate and if either of those things be remove or cease to be the relation cease and the denomination consequent to it though the other receive in itself no alteration at all vg caius whom i consider today as a father cease to be so tomorrow only by the death of his son without any alteration make in himself nay barely by the mind change the object to which it compare anything the same thing be capable of have contrary denominations at the same time vg caius compare to several persons may be truly be say to be older and younger stronger and weaker c relation only betwixt two things whatsoever doth or can exist or be consider as one thing be positive and so not only simple ideas and substances but modes also be positive be though the part of which they consist be very often relative one to another but the whole together consider as one thing and produce in us the complex idea of one thing which idea be in our mind as one picture though an aggregate of divers part and under one name it be a positive or absolute thing or idea thus a triangle though the part thereof compare one to another be relative yet the idea of the whole be a positive absolute idea the same may be say of a family a tune c for there can be no relation but betwixt two things consider as two things there must always be in relation two ideas or things either in themselves really separate or consider as distinct and then a grind or occasion for their comparison all things capable of relation concern relation in general these things may be consider first that there be no one thing whether simple idea substance mode or relation or name of either of them which be not capable of almost an infinite number of considerations in reference to other things and therefore this make no small part of mens thoughts and word vg one single man may at once be concern in and sustain all these follow relations and many more viz father brother son grandfather grandson fatherinlaw soninlaw husband friend enemy subject general judge patron client professor european englishman islander servant master possessor captain superior inferior bigger less older younger contemporary like unlike c to an almost infinite number he be capable of as many relations as there can be occasion of compare him to other things in any manner of agreement disagreement or respect whatsoever for as i say relation be a way of compare or consider two things together and give one or both of them some appellation from that comparison and sometimes give even the relation itself a name our ideas of relations often clearer than of the subject relate secondly this further may be consider concern relation that though it be not contain in the real existence of things but something extraneous and superinduced yet the ideas which relative word stand for be often clearer and more distinct than of those substances to which they do belong the notion we have of a father or brother be a great deal clearer and more distinct than that we have of a man or if you will paternity be a thing whereof it be easier to have a clear idea than of humanity and i can much easier conceive what a friend be than what god because the knowledge of one action or one simple idea be oftentimes sufficient to give me the notion of a relation but to the know of any substantial be an accurate collection of sundry ideas be necessary a man if he compare two things together can hardly be suppose not to know what it be wherein he compare them so that when he compare any things together he can not but have a very clear idea of that relation the ideas then of relations be capable at least of be more perfect and distinct in our mind than those of substances because it be commonly hard to know all the simple ideas which be really in any substance but for the most part easy enough to know the simple ideas that make up any relation i think on or have a name for vg compare two men in reference to one common parent it be very easy to frame the ideas of brothers without have yet the perfect idea of a man for significant relative word as well as others stand only for ideas and those be all either simple or make up of simple ones it suffice for the know the precise idea the relative term stand for to have a clear conception of that which be the foundation of the relation which may be do without have a perfect and clear idea of the thing it be attribute to thus have the notion that one lay the egg out of which the other be hatch i have a clear idea of the relation of dam and chick between the two cassiowaries in st jam park though perhaps i have but a very obscure and imperfect idea of those bird themselves relations all terminate in simple ideas thirdly though there be a great number of considerations wherein things may be compare one with another and so a multitude of relations yet they all terminate in and be concern about those simple ideas either of sensation or reflection which i think to be the whole materials of all our knowledge to clear this i shall show it in the most considerable relations that we have any notion of and in some that seem to be the most remote from sense or reflection which yet will appear to have their ideas from thence and leave it past doubt that the notions we have of them be but certain simple ideas and so originally derive from sense or reflection term lead the mind beyond the subject denominate be relative fourthly that relation be the consider of one thing with another which be extrinsical to it it be evident that all word that necessarily lead the mind to any other ideas than be suppose really to exist in that thing to which the word be apply be relative word vg a man black merry thoughtful thirsty angry extend these and the like be all absolute because they neither signify nor intimate anything but what do or be suppose really to exist in the man thus denominate but father brother king husband blacker merrier c be word which together with the thing they denominate imply also something else separate and exterior to the existence of that thing all relatives make up of simple ideas have lay down these premise concern relation in general i shall now proceed to show in some instance how all the ideas we have of relation be make up as the others be only of simple ideas and that they all how refine or remote from sense soever they seem terminate at last in simple ideas i shall begin with the most comprehensive relation wherein all things that do or can exist be concern and that be the relation of cause and effect the idea whereof how derive from the two fountains of all our knowledge sensation and reflection i shall in the next place consider of cause and effect and other relations whence the ideas of cause and effect get in the notice that our sense take of the constant vicissitude of things we can not but observe that several particular both qualities and substances begin to exist and that they receive this their existence from the due application and operation of some other be from this observation we get our ideas of cause and effect that which produce any simple or complex idea we denote by the general name cause and that which be produce effect thus find that in that substance which we call wax fluidity which be a simple idea that be not in it before be constantly produce by the application of a certain degree of heat we call the simple idea of heat in relation to fluidity in wax the cause of it and fluidity the effect so also find that the substance wood which be a certain collection of simple ideas so call by the application of fire be turn into another substance call ash ie another complex idea consist of a collection of simple ideas quite different from that complex idea which we call wood we consider fire in relation to ash as cause and the ash as effect so that whatever be consider by us to conduce or operate to the produce any particular simple idea or collection of simple ideas whether substance or mode which do not before exist hath thereby in our mind the relation of a cause and so be denominate by us creation generation make alteration have thus from what our sense be able to discover in the operations of body on one another get the notion of cause and effect viz that a cause be that which make any other thing either simple idea substance or mode begin to be and an effect be that which have its begin from some other thing the mind find no great difficulty to distinguish the several originals of things into two sort first when the thing be wholly make new so that no part thereof do ever exist before as when a new particle of matter doth begin to exist in rerum natura which have before no be and this we call creation secondly when a thing be make up of particles which do all of them before exist but that very thing so constitute of preexist particles which consider all together make up such a collection of simple ideas have not any existence before as this man this egg rise or cherry c and this when refer to a substance produce in the ordinary course of nature by internal principle but set on work by and receive from some external agent or cause and work by insensible ways which we perceive not we call generation when the cause be extrinsical and the effect produce by a sensible separation or juxtaposition of discernible part we call it make and such be all artificial things when any simple idea be produce which be not in that subject before we call it alteration thus a man be generate a picture make and either of them alter when any new sensible quality or simple idea be produce in either of them which be not there before and the things thus make to exist which be not there before be effect and those things which operate to the existence cause in which and all other case we may observe that the notion of cause and effect have its rise from ideas receive by sensation or reflection and that this relation how comprehensive soever terminate at last in them for to have the idea of cause and effect it suffice to consider any simple idea or substance as begin to exist by the operation of some other without know the manner of that operation relations of time time and place be also the foundations of very large relations and all finite be at least be concern in them but have already show in another place how we get those ideas it may suffice here to intimate that most of the denominations of things receive from time be only relations thus when any one say that queen elizabeth live sixtynine and reign fortyfive years these word import only the relation of that duration to some other and mean no more but this that the duration of her existence be equal to sixtynine and the duration of her government to fortyfive annual revolutions of the sun and so be all word answer how long again william the conqueror invade england about the year which mean this that take the duration from our saviours time till now for one entire great length of time it show at what distance this invasion be from the two extremes and so do all word of time answer to the question when which show only the distance of any point of time from the period of a longer duration from which we measure and to which we thereby consider it as relate some ideas of time suppose positive and find to be relative there be yet besides those other word of time that ordinarily be think to stand for positive ideas which yet will when consider be find to be relative such as be young old c which include and intimate the relation anything have to a certain length of duration whereof we have the idea in our mind thus have settle in our thoughts the idea of the ordinary duration of a man to be seventy years when we say a man be young we mean that his age be yet but a small part of that which usually men attain to and when we denominate him old we mean that his duration be run out almost to the end of that which men do not usually exceed and so it be but compare the particular age or duration of this or that man to the idea of that duration which we have in our mind as ordinarily belong to that sort of animals which be plain in the application of these name to other things for a man be call young at twenty years and very young at seven years old but yet a horse we call old at twenty and a dog at seven years because in each of these we compare their age to different ideas of duration which be settle in our mind as belong to these several sort of animals in the ordinary course of nature but the sun and star though they have outlast several generations of men we call not old because we do not know what period god hath set to that sort of be this term belong properly to those things which we can observe in the ordinary course of things by a natural decay to come to an end in a certain period of time and so have in our mind as it be a standard to which we can compare the several part of their duration and by the relation they bear thereunto call them young or old which we can not therefore do to a ruby or a diamond things whose usual periods we know not relations of place and extension the relation also that things have to one another in their place and distance be very obvious to observe as above below a mile distant from charingcross in england and in london but as in duration so in extension and bulk there be some ideas that be relative which we signify by name that be think positive as great and little be truly relations for here also have by observation settle in our mind the ideas of the bigness of several species of things from those we have be most accustom to we make them as it be the standards whereby to denominate the bulk of others thus we call a great apple such a one as be bigger than the ordinary sort of those we have be use to and a little horse such a one as come not up to the size of that idea which we have in our mind to belong ordinarily to horse and that will be a great horse to a welchman which be but a little one to a fleming they two have from the different breed of their countries take severalsized ideas to which they compare and in relation to which they denominate their great and their little absolute term often stand for relations so likewise weak and strong be but relative denominations of power compare to some ideas we have at that time of greater or less power thus when we say a weak man we mean one that have not so much strength or power to move as usually men have or usually those of his size have which be a compare his strength to the idea we have of the usual strength of men or men of such a size the like when we say the creatures be all weak things weak there be but a relative term signify the disproportion there be in the power of god and the creatures and so abundance of word in ordinary speech stand only for relations and perhaps the greatest part which at first sight seem to have no such signification vg the ship have necessary store necessary and store be both relative word one have a relation to the accomplish the voyage intend and the other to future use all which relations how they be confine to and terminate in ideas derive from sensation or reflection be too obvious to need any explication of identity and diversity wherein identity consist another occasion the mind often take of compare be the very be of things when consider anything as exist at any determine time and place we compare it with itself exist at another time and thereon form the ideas of identity and diversity when we see anything to be in any place in any instant of time we be sure be it what it will that it be that very thing and not another which at that same time exist in another place how like and undistinguishable soever it may be in all other respect and in this consist identity when the ideas it be attribute to vary not at all from what they be that moment wherein we consider their former existence and to which we compare the present for we never find nor conceive it possible that two things of the same kind should exist in the same place at the same time we rightly conclude that whatever exist anywhere at any time exclude all of the same kind and be there itself alone when therefore we demand whether anything be the same or no it refer always to something that exist such a time in such a place which it be certain at that instant be the same with itself and no other from whence it follow that one thing can not have two beginnings of existence nor two things one begin it be impossible for two things of the same kind to be or exist in the same instant in the very same place or one and the same thing in different place that therefore that have one begin be the same thing and that which have a different begin in time and place from that be not the same but diverse that which have make the difficulty about this relation have be the little care and attention use in have precise notions of the things to which it be attribute identity of substances we have the ideas but of three sort of substances god finite intelligences body first god be without begin eternal unalterable and everywhere and therefore concern his identity there can be no doubt secondly finite spirit have have each its determinate time and place of begin to exist the relation to that time and place will always determine to each of them its identity as long as it exist thirdly the same will hold of every particle of matter to which no addition or subtraction of matter be make it be the same for though these three sort of substances as we term them do not exclude one another out of the same place yet we can not conceive but that they must necessarily each of them exclude any of the same kind out of the same place or else the notions and name of identity and diversity would be in vain and there could be no such distinctions of substances or anything else one from another for example could two body be in the same place at the same time then those two parcel of matter must be one and the same take them great or little nay all body must be one and the same for by the same reason that two particles of matter may be in one place all body may be in one place which when it can be suppose take away the distinction of identity and diversity of one and more and render it ridiculous but it be a contradiction that two or more should be one identity and diversity be relations and ways of compare well found and of use to the understand identity of modes and relations all other things be but modes or relations ultimately terminate in substances the identity and diversity of each particular existence of them too will be by the same way determine only as to things whose existence be in succession such as be the action of finite be vg motion and think both which consist in a continue train of succession concern their diversity there can be no question because each perish the moment it begin they can not exist in different time or in different place as permanent be can at different time exist in distant place and therefore no motion or think consider as at different time can be the same each part thereof have a different begin of existence principium individuationis from what have be say it be easy to discover what be so much inquire after the principium individuationis and that it be plain be existence itself which determine a be of any sort to a particular time and place incommunicable to two be of the same kind this though it seem easier to conceive in simple substances or modes yet when reflect on be not more difficult in compound ones if care be take to what it be apply vg let us suppose an atom ie a continue body under one immutable superficies exist in a determine time and place it be evident that consider in any instant of its existence it be in that instant the same with itself for be at that instant what it be and nothing else it be the same and so must continue as long as its existence be continue for so long it will be the same and no other in like manner if two or more atoms be join together into the same mass every one of those atoms will be the same by the forego rule and whilst they exist unite together the mass consist of the same atoms must be the same mass or the same body let the part be ever so differently jumble but if one of these atoms be take away or one new one add it be no longer the same mass or the same body in the state of live creatures their identity depend not on a mass of the same particles but on something else for in them the variation of great parcel of matter alter not the identity an oak grow from a plant to a great tree and then lop be still the same oak and a colt grow up to a horse sometimes fat sometimes lean be all the while the same horse though in both these case there may be a manifest change of the part so that truly they be not either of them the same mass of matter though they be truly one of them the same oak and the other the same horse the reason whereof be that in these two casesa mass of matter and a live bodyidentity be not apply to the same thing identity of vegetables we must therefore consider wherein an oak differ from a mass of matter and that seem to me to be in this that the one be only the cohesion of particles of matter any how unite the other such a disposition of them as constitute the part of an oak and such an organization of those part as be fit to receive and distribute nourishment so as to continue and frame the wood bark and leave c of an oak in which consist the vegetable life that be then one plant which have such an organization of part in one coherent body partake of one common life it continue to be the same plant as long as it partake of the same life though that life be communicate to new particles of matter vitally unite to the live plant in a like continue organization conformable to that sort of plant for this organization be at any one instant in any one collection of matter be in that particular concrete distinguish from all other and be that individual life which exist constantly from that moment both forward and backwards in the same continuity of insensibly succeed part unite to the live body of the plant it have that identity which make the same plant and all the part of it part of the same plant during all the time that they exist unite in that continue organization which be fit to convey that common life to all the part so unite identity of animals the case be not so much different in brutes but that any one may hence see what make an animal and continue it the same something we have like this in machine and may serve to illustrate it for example what be a watch it be plain it be nothing but a fit organization or construction of part to a certain end which when a sufficient force be add to it it be capable to attain if we would suppose this machine one continue body all whose organize part be repair increase or diminish by a constant addition or separation of insensible part with one common life we should have something very much like the body of an animal with this difference that in an animal the fitness of the organization and the motion wherein life consist begin together the motion come from within but in machine the force come sensibly from without be often away when the organ be in order and well fit to receive it the identity of man this also show wherein the identity of the same man consist viz in nothing but a participation of the same continue life by constantly fleet particles of matter in succession vitally unite to the same organize body he that shall place the identity of man in anything else but like that of other animals in one fitly organize body take in any one instant and from thence continue under one organization of life in several successively fleet particles of matter unite to it will find it hard to make an embryo one of years mad and sober the same man by any supposition that will not make it possible for seth ismael socrates pilate st austin and caesar borgia to be the same man for if the identity of soul alone make the same man and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same individual spirit may not be unite to different body it will be possible that those men live in distant age and of different temper may have be the same man which way of speak must be from a very strange use of the word man apply to an idea out of which body and shape be exclude and that way of speak would agree yet worse with the notions of those philosophers who allow of transmigration and be of opinion that the souls of men may for their miscarriages be detruded into the body of beasts as fit habitations with organs suit to the satisfaction of their brutal inclinations but yet i think nobody could he be sure that the soul of heliogabalus be in one of his hog would yet say that hog be a man or heliogabalus idea of identity suit to the idea it be apply to it be not therefore unity of substance that comprehend all sort of identity or will determine it in every case but to conceive and judge of it aright we must consider what idea the word it be apply to stand for it be one thing to be the same substance another the same man and a third the same person if person man and substance be three name stand for three different ideasfor such as be the idea belong to that name such must be the identity which if it have be a little more carefully attend to would possibly have prevent a great deal of that confusion which often occur about this matter with no small seem difficulties especially concern personal identity which therefore we shall in the next place a little consider same man an animal be a live organize body and consequently the same animal as we have observe be the same continue life communicate to different particles of matter as they happen successively to be unite to that organize live body and whatever be talk of other definitions ingenious observation put it past doubt that the idea in our mind of which the sound man in our mouth be the sign be nothing else but of an animal of such a certain form since i think i may be confident that whoever should see a creature of his own shape or make though it have no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot would call him still a man or whoever should hear a cat or a parrot discourse reason and philosophize would call or think it nothing but a cat or a parrot and say the one be a dull irrational man and the other a very intelligent rational parrot a relation we have in an author of great note be sufficient to countenance the supposition of a rational parrot his word be i have a mind to know from prince maurices own mouth the account of a common but much credit story that i have hear so often from many others of an old parrot he have in brazil during his government there that speak and ask and an swered common question like a reasonable creature so that those of his train there generally conclude it to be witchery or possession and one of his chaplains who live long afterwards in holland would never from that time endure a parrot but say they all have a devil in them i have hear many particulars of this story and as sever by people hard to be discredit which make me ask prince maurice what there be of it he say with his usual plainness and dryness in talk there be something true but a great deal false of what have be report i desire to know of him what there be of the first he tell me short and coldly that he have hear of such an old parrot when he have be at brazil and though he believe nothing of it and it be a good way off yet he have so much curiosity as to send for it that it be a very great and a very old one and when it come first into the room where the prince be with a great many dutchmen about him it say presently what a company of white men be here they ask it what it think that man be point to the prince it answer some general or other when they bring it close to him he ask it dou venezvous it answer de marinnan the prince a qui estesvous the parrot a un portugais the prince que faistu la parrot je garde les poulles the prince laugh and say vous gardez les poulles the parrot answer oui moi et je scai bien faire and make the chuck four or five time that people use to make to chickens when they call them i set down the word of this worthy dialogue in french just as prince maurice say them to me i ask him in what language the parrot speak and he say in brazilian i ask whether he understand brazilian he say no but he have take care to have two interpreters by him the one a dutchman that speak brazilian and the other a brazilian that speak dutch that he ask them separately and privately and both of them agree in tell him just the same thing that the parrot have say i could not but tell this odd story because it be so much out of the way and from the first hand and what may pass for a good one for i dare say this prince at least believe himself in all he tell me have ever pass for a very honest and pious man i leave it to naturalists to reason and to other men to believe as they please upon it however it be not perhaps amiss to relieve or enliven a busy scene sometimes with such digressions whether to the purpose or no i have take care that the reader should have the story at large in the author own word because he seem to me not to have think it incredible for it can not be imagine that so able a man as he who have sufficiency enough to warrant all the testimonies he give of himself should take so much pain in a place where it have nothing to do to pin so close not only on a man whom he mention as his friend but on a prince in whom he acknowledge very great honesty and piety a story which if he himself think incredible he could not but also think ridiculous the prince it be plain who vouch this story and our author who relate it from him both of them call this talker a parrot and i ask any one else who think such a story fit to be tell whether if this parrot and all of its kind have always talk as we have a princes word for it this one didwhether i say they would not have pass for a race of rational animals but yet whether for all that they would have be allow to be men and not parrot for i presume it be not the idea of a think or rational be alone that make the idea of a man in most people sense but of a body so and so shape join to it and if that be the idea of a man the same successive body not shift all at once must as well as the same immaterial spirit go to the make of the same man personal identity this be premise to find wherein personal identity consist we must consider what person stand forwhich i think be a think intelligent be that have reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself the same think thing in different time and place which it do only by that consciousness which be inseparable from think and as it seem to me essential to it it be impossible for any one to perceive without perceive that he do perceive when we see hear smell taste feel meditate or will anything we know that we do so thus it be always as to our present sensations and perceptions and by this every one be to himself that which he call selfit not be consider in this case whether the same self be continue in the same or divers substances for since consciousness always accompany think and it be that which make every one to be what he call self and thereby distinguish himself from all other think things in this alone consist personal identity ie the sameness of a rational be and as far as this consciousness can be extend backwards to any past action or think so far reach the identity of that person it be the same self now it be then and it be by the same self with this present one that now reflect on it that that action be do consciousness make personal identity but it be further inquire whether it be the same identical substance this few would think they have reason to doubt of if these perceptions with their consciousness always remain present in the mind whereby the same think thing would be always consciously present and as would be think evidently the same to itself but that which seem to make the difficulty be this that this consciousness be interrupt always by forgetfulness there be no moment of our live wherein we have the whole train of all our past action before our eye in one view but even the best memories lose the sight of one part whilst they be view another and we sometimes and that the greatest part of our live not reflect on our past selves be intent on our present thoughts and in sound sleep have no thoughts at all or at least none with that consciousness which remark our wake thoughtsi say in all these case our consciousness be interrupt and we lose the sight of our past selves doubt be raise whether we be the same think thing ie the same substance or no which however reasonable or unreasonable concern not personal identity at all the question be what make the same person and not whether it be the same identical substance which always think in the same person which in this case matter not at all different substances by the same consciousness where they do partake in it be unite into one person as well as different body by the same life be unite into one animal whose identity be preserve in that change of substances by the unity of one continue life for it be the same consciousness that make a man be himself to himself personal identity depend on that only whether it be annex solely to one individual substance or can be continue in a succession of several substances for as far as any intelligent be can repeat the idea of any past action with the same consciousness it have of it at first and with the same consciousness it have of any present action so far it be the same personal self for it be by the consciousness it have of its present thoughts and action that it be self to itself now and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to action past or to come and would be by distance of time or change of substance no more two persons than a man be two men by wear other clothe today than he do yesterday with a long or a short sleep between the same consciousness unite those distant action into the same person whatever substances contribute to their production personal identity in change of substance that this be so we have some kind of evidence in our very body all whose particles whilst vitally unite to this same think conscious self so that we feel when they be touch and be affect by and conscious of good or harm that happen to them as a part of ourselves ie of our think conscious self thus the limbs of his body be to every one a part of himself he sympathize and be concern for them cut off a hand and thereby separate it from that consciousness he have of its heat cold and other affections and it be then no longer a part of that which be himself any more than the remotest part of matter thus we see the substance whereof personal self consist at one time may be vary at another without the change of personal identity there be no question about the same person though the limbs which but now be a part of it be cut off personality in change of substance but the question be whether if the same substance which think be change it can be the same person or remain the same it can be different persons and to this i answer first this can be no question at all to those who place think in a purely material animal constitution void of an immaterial substance for whether their supposition be true or no it be plain they conceive personal identity preserve in something else than identity of substance as animal identity be preserve in identity of life and not of substance and therefore those who place think in an immaterial substance only before they can come to deal with these men must show why personal identity can not be preserve in the change of immaterial substances or variety of particular immaterial substances as well as animal identity be preserve in the change of material substances or variety of particular body unless they will say it be one immaterial spirit that make the same life in brutes as it be one immaterial spirit that make the same person in men which the cartesians at least will not admit for fear of make brutes think things too whether in change of think substances there can be one person but next as to the first part of the question whether if the same think substance suppose immaterial substances only to think be change it can be the same person i answer that can not be resolve but by those who know what kind of substances they be that do think and whether the consciousness of past action can be transfer from one think substance to another i grant be the same consciousness the same individual action it could not but it be a present representation of a past action why it may not be possible that that may be represent to the mind to have be which really never be will remain to be show and therefore how far the consciousness of past action be annex to any individual agent so that another can not possibly have it will be hard for us to determine till we know what kind of action it be that can not be do without a reflex act of perception accompany it and how perform by think substances who can not think without be conscious of it but that which we call the same consciousness not be the same individual act why one intellectual substance may not have represent to it as do by itself what it never do and be perhaps do by some other agentwhy i say such a representation may not possibly be without reality of matter of fact as well as sev eral representations in dream be which yet whilst dream we take for truewill be difficult to conclude from the nature of things and that it never be so will by us till we have clearer view of the nature of think substances be best resolve into the goodness of god who as far as the happiness or misery of any of his sensible creatures be concern in it will not by a fatal error of theirs transfer from one to another that consciousness which draw reward or punishment with it how far this may be an argument against those who would place think in a system of fleet animal spirit i leave to be consider but yet to return to the question before us it must be allow that if the same consciousness which as have be show be quite a different thing from the same numerical figure or motion in body can be transfer from one think substance to another it will be possible that two think substances may make but one person for the same consciousness be preserve whether in the same or different substances the personal identity be preserve whether the same immaterial substance remain there can be two persons as to the second part of the question whether the same immaterial substance remain there may be two distinct persons which question seem to me to be build on thiswhether the same immaterial be be conscious of the action of its past duration may be wholly strip of all the consciousness of its past existence and lose it beyond the power of ever retrieve it again and so as it be begin a new account from a new period have a consciousness that can not reach beyond this new state all those who hold preexistence be evidently of this mind since they allow the soul to have no remain consciousness of what it do in that preexistent state either wholly separate from body or inform any other body and if they should not it be plain experience would be against them so that personal identity reach no further than consciousness reach a preexistent spirit not have continue so many age in a state of silence must need make different persons suppose a christian platonist or a pythagorean should upon gods have end all his work of creation the seventh day think his soul hath exist ever since and should imagine it have revolve in several human body as i once meet with one who be persuade his have be the soul of socrates how reasonably i will not dispute this i know that in the post he fill which be no inconsiderable one he pass for a very rational man and the press have show that he want not part or learn would any one say that he be not conscious of any of socratess action or thoughts could be the same person with socrates let any one reflect upon himself and conclude that he have in himself an immaterial spirit which be that which think in him and in the constant change of his body keep him the same and be that which he call himself let him also suppose it to be the same soul that be in nestor or thersites at the siege of troy for souls be as far as we know anything of them in their nature indifferent to any parcel of matter the supposition have no apparent absurdity in it which it may have be as well as it be now the soul of any other man but he now have no consciousness of any of the action either of nestor or thersites do or can he conceive himself the same person with either of them can he be concern in either of their action attribute them to himself or think them his own more than the action of any other men that ever exist so that this consciousness not reach to any of the action of either of those men he be no more one self with either of them than if the soul or immaterial spirit that now inform him have be create and begin to exist when it begin to inform his present body though it be never so true that the same spirit that inform nestors or thersites body be numerically the same that now inform his for this would no more make him the same person with nestor than if some of the particles of matter that be once a part of nestor be now a part of this man the same immaterial substance without the same consciousness no more make the same person by be unite to any body than the same particle of matter without consciousness unite to any body make the same person but let him once find himself conscious of any of the action of nestor he then find himself the same person with nestor the body as well as the soul go to the make of a man and thus may we be able without any difficulty to conceive the same person at the resurrection though in a body not exactly in make or part the same which he have herethe same consciousness go along with the soul that inhabit it but yet the soul alone in the change of body would scarce to any one but to him that make the soul the man be enough to make the same man for should the soul of a prince carry with it the consciousness of the princes past life enter and inform the body of a cobbler as soon as desert by his own soul every one see he would be the same person with the prince accountable only for the princes action but who would say it be the same man the body too go to the make the man and would i guess to everybody determine the man in this case wherein the soul with all its princely thoughts about it would not make another man but he would be the same cobbler to every one besides himself i know that in the ordinary way of speak the same person and the same man stand for one and the same thing and indeed every one will always have a liberty to speak as he please and to apply what articulate sound to what ideas he think fit and change them as often as he please but yet when we will inquire what make the same spirit man or person we must fix the ideas of spirit man or person in our mind and have resolve with ourselves what we mean by them it will not be hard to determine in either of them or the like when it be the same and when not consciousness alone unite action into the same person but though the same immaterial substance or soul do not alone wherever it be and in whatsoever state make the same man yet it be plain consciousness as far as ever it can be extendedshould it be to age pastunites existences and action very remote in time into the same person as well as it do the existences and action of the immediately precede moment so that whatever have the consciousness of present and past action be the same person to whom they both belong have i the same consciousness that i saw the ark and noahs flood as that i saw an overflow of the thames last winter or as that i write now i could no more doubt that i who write this now that saw the thames overflow last winter and that view the flood at the general deluge be the same selfplace that self in what substance you pleasethan that i who write this be the same myself now whilst i write whether i consist of all the same substance material or immaterial or no that i be yesterday for as to this point of be the same self it matter not whether this present self be make up of the same or other substancesi be as much concern and as justly accountable for any action that be do a thousand years since appropriate to me now by this selfconsciousness as i be for what i do the last moment self depend on consciousness not on substance self be that conscious think thingwhatever substance make up of whether spiritual or material simple or compound it matter notwhich be sensible or conscious of pleasure and pain capable of happiness or misery and so be concern for itself as far as that consciousness extend thus every one find that whilst comprehend under that consciousness the little finger be as much a part of himself as what be most so upon separation of this little finger should this consciousness go along with the little finger and leave the rest of the body it be evident the little finger would be the person the same person and self then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body as in this case it be the consciousness that go along with the substance when one part be separate from another which make the same person and constitute this inseparable self so it be in reference to substances remote in time that with which the consciousness of this present think thing can join itself make the same person and be one self with it and with nothing else and so attribute to itself and own all the action of that thing as its own as far as that consciousness reach and no further as every one who reflect will perceive persons not substances the object of reward and punishment in this personal identity be found all the right and justice of reward and punishment happiness and misery be that for which every one be concern for himself and not matter what become of any substance not join to or affect with that consciousness for as it be evident in the instance i give but now if the consciousness go along with the little finger when it be cut off that would be the same self which be concern for the whole body yesterday as make part of itself whose action then it can not but admit as its own now though if the same body should still live and immediately from the separation of the little finger have its own peculiar consciousness whereof the little finger know nothing it would not at all be concern for it as a part of itself or could own any of its action or have any of them impute to him which show wherein personal identity consist this may show us wherein personal identity consist not in the identity of substance but as i have say in the identity of consciousness wherein if socrates and the present mayor of queinborough agree they be the same person if the same socrates wake and sleep do not partake of the same consciousness socrates wake and sleep be not the same person and to punish socrates wake for what sleep socrates think and wake socrates be never conscious of would be no more of right than to punish one twin for what his brothertwin do whereof he know nothing because their outsides be so like that they could not be distinguish for such twin have be see absolute oblivion separate what be thus forget from the person but not from the man but yet possibly it will still be objectedsuppose i wholly lose the memory of some part of my life beyond a possibility of retrieve them so that perhaps i shall never be conscious of them again yet be i not the same person that do those action have those thoughts that i once be conscious of though i have now forget them to which i answer that we must here take notice what the word i be apply to which in this case be the man only and the same man be presume to be the same person i be easily here suppose to stand also for the same person but if it be possible for the same man to have distinct incommunicable consciousness at different time it be past doubt the same man would at different time make different persons which we see be the sense of mankind in the solemnest declaration of their opinions human laws not punish the mad man for the sober man action nor the sober man for what the mad man didthereby make them two persons which be somewhat explain by our way of speak in english when we say such an one be not himself or be beside himself in which phrase it be insinuate as if those who now or at least first use them think that self be change the selfsame person be no longer in that man difference between identity of man and of person but yet it be hard to conceive that socrates the same individual man should be two persons to help us a little in this we must consider what be mean by socrates or the same individual man first it must be either the same individual immaterial think substance in short the same numerical soul and nothing else secondly or the same animal without any regard to an immaterial soul thirdly or the same immaterial spirit unite to the same animal now take which of these suppositions you please it be impossible to make personal identity to consist in anything but consciousness or reach any further than that do for by the first of them it must be allow possible that a man bear of different women and in distant time may be the same man a way of speak which whoever admit must allow it possible for the same man to be two distinct persons as any two that have live in different age without the knowledge of one anothers thoughts by the second and third socrates in this life and after it can not be the same man any way but by the same consciousness and so make human identity to consist in the same thing wherein we place personal identity there will be no difficulty to allow the same man to be the same person but then they who place human identity in consciousness only and not in something else must consider how they will make the infant socrates the same man with socrates after the resurrection but whatsoever to some men make a man and consequently the same individual man wherein per hap few be agree personal identity can by us be place in nothing but consciousness which be that alone which make what we call self without involve us in great absurdities but be not a man drink and sober the same person why else be he punish for the fact he commit when drink though he be never afterwards conscious of it just as much the same person as a man that walk and do other things in his sleep be the same person and be answerable for any mischief he shall do in it human laws punish both with a justice suitable to their way of knowledgebecause in these case they can not distinguish certainly what be real what counterfeit and so the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep be not admit as a plea for though punishment be annex to personality and personality to consciousness and the drunkard perhaps be not conscious of what he do yet human judicatures justly punish him because the fact be prove against him but want of consciousness can not be prove for him but in the great day wherein the secrets of all hearts shall be lay open it may be reasonable to think no one shall be make to answer for what he know nothing of but shall receive his doom his conscience accuse or excuse him consciousness alone unite remote existences into one person nothing but consciousness can unite remote existences into the same person the identity of substance will not do it for whatever substance there be however frame without consciousness there be no person and a carcass may be a person as well as any sort of substance be so without consciousness could we suppose two distinct incommunicable consciousnesses act the same body the one constantly by day the other by night and on the other side the same consciousness act by intervals two distinct body i ask in the first case whether the day and the nightman would not be two as distinct persons as socrates and plato and whether in the second case there would not be one person in two distinct body as much as one man be the same in two distinct clothe nor be it at all material to say that this same and this distinct consciousness in the case above mention be owe to the same and distinct immaterial substances bring it with them to those body which whether true or no alter not the case since it be evident the personal identity would equally be determine by the consciousness whether that consciousness be annex to some individual immaterial substance or no for grant that the think substance in man must be necessarily suppose immaterial it be evident that immaterial think thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness and be restore to it again as appear in the forgetfulness men often have of their past action and the mind many time recover the memory of a past consciousness which it have lose for twenty years together make these intervals of memory and forgetfulness to take their turn regularly by day and night and you have two persons with the same immaterial spirit as much as in the former instance two persons with the same body so that self be not determine by identity or diversity of substance which it can not be sure of but only by identity of consciousness not the substance with which the consciousness may be unite indeed it may conceive the substance whereof it be now make up to have exist formerly unite in the same conscious be but consciousness remove that substance be no more itself or make no more a part of it than any other substance as be evident in the instance we have already give of a limb cut off of whose heat or cold or other affections have no longer any consciousness it be no more of a man self than any other matter of the universe in like manner it will be in reference to any immaterial substance which be void of that consciousness whereby i be myself to myself if there be any part of its existence which i can not upon recollection join with that present consciousness whereby i be now myself it be in that part of its existence no more myself than any other immaterial be for whatsoever any substance have think or do which i can not recollect and by my consciousness make my own think and action it will no more belong to me whether a part of me think or do it than if it have be think or do by any other immaterial be anywhere exist consciousness unite substances material or spiritual with the same personality i agree the more probable opinion be that this consciousness be annex to and the affection of one individual immaterial substance but let men accord to their diverse hypotheses resolve of that as they please this every intelligent be sensible of happiness or misery must grantthat there be something that be himself that he be concern for and would have happy that this self have exist in a continue duration more than one instant and therefore it be possible may exist as it have do months and years to come without any certain bound to be set to its duration and may be the same self by the same consciousness continue on for the future and thus by this consciousness he find himself to be the same self which do such and such an action some years since by which he come to be happy or miserable now in all which account of self the same numerical substance be not consider as make the same self but the same continue consciousness in which several substances may have be unite and again separate from it which whilst they continue in a vital union with that wherein this consciousness then reside make a part of that same self thus any part of our body vitally unite to that which be conscious in us make a part of ourselves but upon separation from the vital union by which that consciousness be communicate that which a moment since be part of ourselves be now no more so than a part of another man self be a part of me and it be not impossible but in a little time may become a real part of another person and so we have the same numerical substance become a part of two different persons and the same person preserve under the change of various substances could we suppose any spirit wholly strip of all its memory or consciousness of past action as we find our mind always be of a great part of ours and sometimes of them all the union or separation of such a spiritual substance would make no variation of personal identity any more than that of any particle of matter do any substance vitally unite to the present think be be a part of that very same self which now be anything unite to it by a conscious ness of former action make also a part of the same self which be the same both then and now person a forensic term person as i take it be the name for this self wherever a man find what he call himself there i think another may say be the same person it be a forensic term appropriate action and their merit and so belong only to intelligent agents capable of a law and happiness and misery this personality extend itself beyond present existence to what be past only by consciousnesswhereby it become concern and accountable own and impute to itself past action just upon the same grind and for the same reason as it do the present all which be found in a concern for happiness the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness that which be conscious of pleasure and pain desire that that self that be conscious should be happy and therefore whatever past action it can not reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness it can be no more concern in than if they have never be do and to receive pleasure or pain ie reward or punishment on the account of any such action be all one as to be make happy or miserable in its first be without any demerit at all for suppose a man punish now for what he have do in another life whereof he could be make to have no consciousness at all what difference be there between that punishment and be create miserable and therefore conformable to this the apostle tell us that at the great day when every one shall receive accord to his do the secrets of all hearts shall be lay open the sentence shall be justify by the consciousness all persons shall have that they themselves in what body soever they appear or what substances soever that consciousness adhere to be the same that commit those action and deserve that punishment for them suppositions that look strange be pardonable in our ignorance i be apt enough to think i have in treat of this subject make some suppositions that will look strange to some readers and possibly they be so in themselves but yet i think they be such as be pardonable in this ignorance we be in of the nature of that think thing that be in us and which we look on as ourselves do we know what it be or how it be tie to a certain system of fleet animal spirit or whether it could or could not perform its operations of think and memory out of a body organize as ours be and whether it have please god that no one such spirit shall ever be unite to any but one such body upon the right constitution of whose organs its memory should depend we might see the absurdity of some of those suppositions i have make but take as we ordinarily now do in the dark concern these matter the soul of a man for an immaterial substance independent from matter and indifferent alike to it all there can from the nature of things be no absurdity at all to suppose that the same soul may at different time be unite to different body and with them make up for that time one man as well as we suppose a part of a sheeps body yesterday should be a part of a man body tomorrow and in that union make a vital part of meliboeus himself as well as it do of his ram the difficulty from ill use of name to conclude whatever substance begin to exist it must during its existence necessarily be the same whatever compositions of substances begin to exist during the union of those substances the concrete must be the same whatsoever mode begin to exist during its existence it be the same and so if the composition be of distinct substances and different modes the same rule hold whereby it will appear that the difficulty or obscurity that have be about this matter rather rise from the name illused than from any obscurity in things themselves for whatever make the specific idea to which the name be apply if that idea be steadily keep to the distinction of anything into the same and divers will easily be conceive and there can arise no doubt about it continuance of that which we have make to he our complex idea of man make the same man for suppose a rational spirit be the idea of a man it be easy to know what be the same man viz the same spirit whether separate or in a bodywill be the same man suppose a rational spirit vitally unite to a body of a certain conformation of part to make a man whilst that rational spirit with that vital conformation of part though continue in a fleet successive body remain it will be the same man but if to any one the idea of a man be but the vital union of part in a certain shape as long as that vital union and shape remain in a concrete no otherwise the same but by a continue succession of fleet particles it will be the same man for whatever be the composition whereof the complex idea be make whenever existence make it one particular thing under any denomination the same existence continue preserve it the same individual under the same denomination of other relations ideas of proportional relations besides the beforementioned occasion of time place and causality of compare or refer things one to another there be as i have say infinite others some whereof i shall mention first the first i shall name be some one simple idea which be capable of part or degrees afford an occasion of compare the subject wherein it be to one another in respect of that simple idea vg whiter sweeter equal more c these relations depend on the equality and excess of the same simple idea in several subject may be call if one will proportional and that these be only conversant about those simple ideas receive from sensation or reflection be so evident that nothing need be say to evince it natural relation secondly another occasion of compare things together or consider one thing so as to include in that consideration some other thing be the circumstances of their origin or begin which be not afterwards to be alter make the relations depend thereon as last as the subject to which they belong vg father and son brothers cousingermans c which have their relations by one community of blood wherein they partake in several degrees countrymen ie those who be bear in the same country or tract of grind and these i call natural relations wherein we may observe that mankind have fit their notions and word to the use of common life and not to the truth and extent of things for it be certain that in reality the relation be the same betwixt the begetter and the beget in the several race of other animals as well as men but yet it be seldom say this bull be the grandfather of such a calf or that two pigeons be cousingermans it be very convenient that by distinct name these relations should be observe and mark out in mankind there be occasion both in laws and other communications one with another to mention and take notice of men under these relations from whence also arise the obligations of several duties amongst men whereas in brutes men have very little or no cause to mind these relations they have not think fit to give them distinct and peculiar name this by the way may give us some light into the different state and growth of languages which be suit only to the convenience of communication be proportion to the notions men have and the commerce of thoughts familiar amongst them and not to the reality or extent of things nor to the various respect might be find among them nor the different abstract considerations might be frame about them where they have no philosophical notions there they have no term to express them and it be no wonder men should have frame no name for those things they find no occasion to discourse of from whence it be easy to imagine why as in some countries they may have not so much as the name for a horse and in others where they be more careful of the pedigrees of their horse than of their own that there they may have not only name for particular horse but also of their several relations of kindred one to another ideas of institute or voluntary relations thirdly sometimes the foundation of consider things with reference to one another be some act whereby any one come by a moral right power or obligation to do something thus a general be one that hath power to command an army and an army under a general be a collection of arm men oblige to obey one man a citizen or a burgher be one who have a right to certain privilege in this or that place all this sort depend upon mens will or agreement in society i call institute or voluntary and may be distinguish from the natural in that they be most if not all of them some way or other alterable and separable from the persons to whom they have sometimes belong though neither of the substances so relate be destroy now though these be all reciprocal as well as the rest and contain in them a reference of two things one to the other yet because one of the two things often want a relative name import that reference men usually take no notice of it and the relation be commonly overlook vg a patron and client ire easily allow to be relations but a constable or dictator be not so readily at first hear consider as such because there be no peculiar name for those who be under the command of a dictator or constable express a relation to either of them though it be certain that either of them hath a certain power over some others and so be so far relate to them as well as a patron be to his client or general to his army ideas of moral relations fourthly there be another sort of relation which be the conformity or disagreement mens voluntary action have to a rule to which they be refer and by which they be judge of which i think may be call moral relation as be that which denominate our moral action and deserve well to be examine there be no part of knowledge wherein we should be more careful to get determine ideas and avoid as much as may be obscurity and confusion human action when with their various end object manners and circumstances they be frame into distinct complex ideas be as have be show so many mix modes a great part whereof have name annex to them thus suppose gratitude to be a readiness to acknowledge and return kindness receive polygamy to be the have more wive than one at once when we frame these notions thus in our mind we have there so many determine ideas of mix modes but this be not all that concern our action it be not enough to have determine ideas of them and to know what name belong to such and such combinations of ideas we have a further and greater concernment and that be to know whether such action so make up be morally good or bad moral good and evil good and evil as hath be show bk ii chap xx ss and chap xxi ss be nothing but pleasure or pain or that which occasion or procure pleasure or pain to us moral good and evil then be only the conformity or disagreement of our voluntary action to some law whereby good or evil be draw on us from the will and power of the lawmaker which good and evil pleasure or pain attend our observance or breach of the law by the decree of the lawmaker be that we call reward and punishment moral rule of these moral rule or laws to which men generally refer and by which they judge of the rectitude or pravity of their action there seem to me to be three sort with their three different enforcements or reward and punishments for since it would be utterly in vain to suppose a rule set to the free action of men without annex to it some enforcement of good and evil to determine his will we must wherever we suppose a law suppose also some reward or punishment annex to that law it would be in vain for one intelligent be to set a rule to the action of another if he have it not in his power to reward the compliance with and punish deviation from his rule by some good and evil that be not the natural product and consequence of the action itself for that be a natural convenience or inconvenience would operate of itself without a law this if i mistake not be the true nature of all law properly so call laws the laws that men generally refer their action to to judge of their rectitude or obliquity seem to me to be these three the divine law the civil law the law of opinion or reputation if i may so call it by the relation they bear to the first of these men judge whether their action be sin or duties by the second whether they be criminal or innocent and by the third whether they be virtues or vices divine law the measure of sin and duty first the divine law whereby that law which god have set to the action of menwhether promulgate to them by the light of nature or the voice of revelation that god have give a rule whereby men should govern themselves i think there be nobody so brutish as to deny he have a right to do it we be his creatures he have goodness and wisdom to direct our action to that which be best and he have power to enforce it by reward and punishments of infinite weight and duration in another life for nobody can take us out of his hand this be the only true touchstone of moral rectitude and by compare them to this law it be that men judge of the most considerable moral good or evil of their action that be whether as duties or sin they be like to procure them happiness or misery from the hand of the almighty civil law the measure of crimes and innocence secondly the civil lawthe rule set by the commonwealth to the action of those who belong to itis another rule to which men refer their action to judge whether they be criminal or no this law nobody overlook the reward and punishments that enforce it be ready at hand and suitable to the power that make it which be the force of the commonwealth engage to protect the live liberties and possessions of those who live accord to its laws and have power to take away life liberty or goods from him who disobey which be the punishment of offences commit against his law philosophical law the measure of virtue and vice thirdly the law of opinion or reputation virtue and vice be name pretend and suppose everywhere to stand for action in their own nature right and wrong and as far as they really be so apply they so far be coincident with the divine law above mention but yet whatever be pretend this be visible that these name virtue and vice in the particular instance of their application through the several nations and societies of men in the world be constantly attribute only to such action as in each country and society be in reputation or discredit nor be it to be think strange that men everywhere should give the name of virtue to those action which amongst them be judge praiseworthy and call that vice which they account blamable since otherwise they would condemn themselves if they should think anything right to which they allow not commendation anything wrong which they let pass without blame thus the measure of what be everywhere call and esteem virtue and vice be this approbation or dislike praise or blame which by a secret and tacit consent establish itself in the several societies tribes and club of men in the world whereby several action come to find credit or disgrace amongst them accord to the judgment maxims or fashion of that place for though men unite into politic societies have resign up to the public the dispose of all their force so that they can not employ it against any fellowcitizens any further than the law of the country direct yet they retain still the power of think well or ill approve or disapprove of the action of those whom they live amongst and converse with and by this approbation and dislike they establish amongst themselves what they will call virtue and vice the measure that men commonly apply to determine what they call virtue and vice that this be the common measure of virtue and vice will appear to any one who consider that though that pass for vice in one country which be count a virtue or at least not vice in another yet everywhere virtue and praise vice and blame go together virtue be everywhere that which be think praiseworthy and nothing else but that which have the allowance of public esteem be call virtue virtue and praise be so unite that they be call often by the same name sunt sua praemia laudi say virgil and so cicero nihil habet natura praestantius quam honestatem quam laudem quam dignitatem quam decus which he tell you be all name for the same thing this be the language of the heathen philosophers who well understand wherein their notions of virtue and vice consist and though perhaps by the different temper education fashion maxims or interest of different sort of men it fell out that what be think praiseworthy in one place escape not censure in another and so in different societies virtues and vices be change yet as to the main they for the most part keep the same everywhere for since nothing can be more natural than to encourage with esteem and reputation that wherein every one find his advantage and to blame and discountenance the contrary it be no wonder that esteem and discredit virtue and vice should in a great measure everywhere correspond with the un changeable rule of right and wrong which the law of god hath establish there be nothing that so directly and visibly secure and advance the general good of mankind in this world as obedience to the laws he have set them and nothing that breed such mischiefs and confusion as the neglect of them and therefore men without renounce all sense and reason and their own interest which they be so constantly true to could not generally mistake in place their commendation and blame on that side that really deserve it not nay even those men whose practice be otherwise fail not to give their approbation right few be deprave to that degree as not to condemn at least in others the fault they themselves be guilty of whereby even in the corruption of manners the true boundaries of the law of nature which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice be pretty well prefer so that even the exhortations of inspire teachers have not fear to appeal to common repute whatsoever be lovely whatsoever be of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise c phil its enforcement be commendation and discredit if any one shall imagine that i have forget my own notion of a law when i make the law whereby men judge of virtue and vice to be nothing else but the consent of private men who have not authority enough to make a law especially want that which be so necessary and essential to a law a power to enforce it i think i may say that he who imagine commendation and disgrace not to be strong motives to men to accommodate themselves to the opinions and rule of those with whom they converse seem little skilled in the nature or history of mankind the greatest part whereof we shall find to govern themselves chiefly if not solely by this law of fashion and so they do that which keep them in reputation with their company little regard the laws of god or the magistrate the penalties that attend the breach of gods laws some nay perhaps most men seldom seriously reflect on and amongst those that do many whilst they break the law entertain thoughts of future reconciliation and make their peace for such breach and as to the punishments due from the laws of the com monwealth they frequently flatter themselves with the hop of impunity but no man escape the punishment of their censure and dislike who offend against the fashion and opinion of the company he keep and would recommend himself to nor be there one of ten thousand who be stiff and insensible enough to bear up under the constant dislike and condemnation of his own club he must be of a strange and unusual constitution who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society solitude many men have seek and be reconcile to but nobody that have the least think or sense of a man about him can live in society under the constant dislike and ill opinion of his familiars and those he converse with this be a burden too heavy for human sufferance and he must be make up of irreconcilable contradictions who can take pleasure in company and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace from his companion these three laws the rule of moral good and evil these three then first the law of god secondly the law of politic societies thirdly the law of fashion or private censure be those to which men variously compare their action and it be by their conformity to one of these laws that they take their measure when they would judge of their moral rectitude and denominate their action good or bad morality be the relation of voluntary action to these rule whether the rule to which as to a touchstone we bring our voluntary action to examine them by and try their goodness and accordingly to name them which be as it be the mark of the value we set upon them whether i say we take that rule from the fashion of the country or the will of a lawmaker the mind be easily able to observe the relation any action hath to it and to judge whether the action agree or disagree with the rule and so hath a notion of moral goodness or evil which be either conformity or not conformity of any action to that rule and therefore be often call moral rectitude this rule be nothing but a collection of several simple ideas the conformity thereto be but so order the action that the simple ideas belong to it may correspond to those which the law require and thus we see how moral be and notions be found on and terminate in these simple ideas we have receive from sensation or reflection for example let us consider the complex idea we signify by the word murder and when we have take it asunder and examine all the particulars we shall find them to amount to a collection of simple ideas derive from reflection or sensation viz first from reflection on the operations of our own mind we have the ideas of will consider purpose beforehand malice or wish ill to another and also of life or perception and selfmotion secondly from sensation we have the collection of those simple sensible ideas which be to be find in a man and of some action whereby we put an end to perception and motion in the man all which simple ideas be comprehend in the word murder this collection of simple ideas be find by me to agree or disagree with the esteem of the country i have be breed in and to be hold by most men there worthy praise or blame i call the action virtuous or vicious if i have the will of a supreme invisible lawgiver for my rule then as i suppose the action command or forbid by god i call it good or evil sin or duty and if i compare it to the civil law the rule make by the legislative power of the country i call it lawful or unlawful a crime or no crime so that whencesoever we take the rule of moral action or by what standard soever we frame in our mind the ideas of virtues or vices they consist only and be make up of collections of simple ideas which we originally receive from sense or reflection and their rectitude or obliquity consist in the agreement or disagreement with those pattern prescribe by some law moral action may be regard either absolutely or as ideas of relation to conceive rightly of moral action we must take notice of them under this twofold consideration first as they be in themselves each make up of such a collection of simple ideas thus drunkenness or lie signify such or such a collection of simple ideas which i call mix modes and in this sense they be as much positive absolute ideas as the drink of a horse or speak of a parrot secondly our action be consider as good bad or indifferent and in this respect they be relative it be their conformity to or disagreement with some rule that make them to be regular or irregular good or bad and so as far as they be compare with a rule and thereupon denominate they come under relation thus the challenge and fight with a man as it be a certain positive mode or particular sort of action by particular ideas distinguish from all others be call duel which when consider in relation to the law of god will deserve the name of sin to the law of fashion in some countries valour and virtue and to the municipal laws of some governments a capital crime in this case when the positive mode have one name and another name as it stand in relation to the law the distinction may as easily be observe as it be in substances where one name vg man be use to signify the thing another vg father to signify the relation the denominations of action often mislead us but because very frequently the positive idea of the action and its moral relation be comprehend together under one name and the game word make use of to express both the mode or action and its moral rectitude or obliquity therefore the relation itself be less take notice of and there be often no distinction make between the positive idea of the action and the reference it have to a rule by which confusion of these two distinct considerations under one term those who yield too easily to the impressions of sound and be forward to take name for things be often mislead in their judgment of action thus the take from another what be his without his knowledge or allowance be properly call steal but that name be commonly understand to signify also the moral pravity of the action and to denote its contrariety to the law men be apt to condemn whatever they hear call steal as an ill action disagree with the rule of right and yet the private take away his sword from a madman to prevent his do mischief though it be properly denominate steal as the name of such a mix mode yet when compare to the law of god and consider in its relation to that supreme rule it be no sin or transgression though the name steal ordinarily carry such an intimation with it relations innumerable and only the most considerable here mention and thus much for the relation of human action to a law which therefore i call moral relations it would make a volume to go over all sort of relations it be not therefore to be expect that i should here mention them all it suffice to our present purpose to show by these what the ideas be we have of this comprehensive consideration call relation which be so various and the occasion of it so many as many as there can be of compare things one to another that it be not very easy to reduce it to rule or under just head those i have mention i think be some of the most considerable and such as may serve to let us see from whence we get our ideas of relations and wherein they be found but before i quit this argument from what have be say give me leave to observe all relations terminate in simple ideas first that it be evident that all relation terminate in and be ultimately found on those simple ideas we have get from sensation or reflection so that all we have in our thoughts ourselves if we think of anything or have any mean or would signify to others when we use word stand for relations be nothing but some simple ideas or collections of simple ideas compare one with another this be so manifest in that sort call proportional that nothing can be more for when a man say honey be sweeter than wax it be plain that his thoughts in this relation terminate in this simple idea sweetness which be equally true of all the rest though where they be compound or decompounded the simple ideas they be make up of be perhaps seldom take notice of vg when the word father be mention first there be mean that particular species or collective idea signify by the word man secondly those sensible simple ideas signify by the word generation and thirdly the effect of it and all the simple ideas signify by the word child so the word friend be take for a man who love and be ready to do good to another have all these follow ideas to the make of it up first all the simple ideas comprehend in the word man or intelligent be secondly the idea of love thirdly the idea of readiness or disposition fourthly the idea of action which be any kind of think or motion fifthly the idea of good which signify anything that may advance his happiness and terminate at last if examine in particular simple ideas of which the word good in general signify any one but if remove from all simple ideas quite it signify nothing at all and thus also all moral word terminate at last though perhaps more remotely in a collection of simple ideas the immediate signification of relative word be very often other suppose know relations which if trace one to another still end in simple ideas we have ordinarily as clear a notion of the relation as of the simple ideas in things on which it be found secondly that in relations we have for the most part if not always as clear a notion of the relation as we have of those simple ideas wherein it be found agreement or disagreement whereon relation depend be things whereof we have commonly as clear ideas as of any other whatsoever it be but the distinguish simple ideas or their degrees one from another without which we could have no distinct knowledge at all for if i have a clear idea of sweetness light or extension i have too of equal or more or less of each of these if i know what it be for one man to be bear of a woman viz sempronia i know what it be for another man to be bear of the same woman sempronia and so have as clear a notion of brothers as of birth and perhaps clearer for if i believe that sempronia digged titus out of the parsleybed as they use to tell children and thereby become his mother and that afterwards in the same manner she digged caius out of the parsleybed i have as clear a notion of the relation of brothers between them as if i have all the skill of a midwife the notion that the same woman contribute as mother equally to their birth though i be ignorant or mistake in the manner of it be that on which i ground the relation and that they agree in that circumstance of birth let it be what it will the compare them then in their descent from the same person without know the particular circumstances of that descent be enough to find my notion of their have or not have the relation of brothers but though the ideas of particular relations be capable of be as clear and distinct in the mind of those who will duly consider them as those of mix modes and more determinate than those of substances yet the name belong to relation be often of as doubtful and uncertain signification as those of substances or mix modes and much more than those of simple ideas because relative word be the mark of this comparison which be make only by mens thoughts and be an idea only in mens mind men frequently apply them to different comparisons of things accord to their own imaginations which do not always correspond with those of others use the same name the notion of relation be the same whether the rule any action be compare to be true or false thirdly that in these i call moral relations i have a true notion of relation by compare the action with the rule whether the rule be true or false for if i measure anything by a yard i know whether the thing i measure be longer or shorter than that suppose yard though perhaps the yard i measure by be not exactly the standard which indeed be another inquiry for though the rule be erroneous and i mistake in it yet the agreement or disagreement observable in that which i compare with make me perceive the relation though measure by a wrong rule i shall thereby be bring to judge amiss of its moral rectitude because i have try it by that which be not the true rule yet i be not mistake in the relation which that action bear to that rule i compare it to which be agreement or disagreement of clear and obscure distinct and confuse ideas ideas some clear and distinct others obscure and confuse have show the original of our ideas and take a view of their several sort consider the difference between the simple and the complex and observe how the complex ones be divide into those of modes substances and relationsall which i think be necessary to be do by any one who would acquaint himself thoroughly with the progress of the mind in its apprehension and knowledge of thingsit will perhaps be think i have dwell long enough upon the examination of ideas i must nevertheless crave leave to offer some few other considerations concern them the first be that some be clear and others obscure some distinct and others confuse clear and obscure explain by sight the perception of the mind be most aptly explain by word relate to the sight we shall best understand what be mean by clear and obscure in our ideas by reflect on what we call clear and obscure in the object of sight light be that which discover to us visible object we give the name of obscure to that which be not place in a light sufficient to discover minutely to us the figure and colour which be observable in it and which in a better light would be discernible in like manner our simple ideas be clear when they be such as the object themselves from whence they be take do or might in a wellordered sensation or perception present them whilst the memory retain them thus and can produce them to the mind whenever it have occasion to consider them they be clear ideas so far as they either want anything of the original exactness or have lose any of their first freshness and be as it be fade or tarnish by time so far be they obscure complex ideas as they be make up of simple ones so they be clear when the ideas that go to their composition be clear and the number and order of those simple ideas that be the ingredients of any complex one be determinate and certain cause of obscurity the cause of obscurity in simple ideas seem to be either dull organs or very slight and transient impressions make by the object or else a weakness in the memory not able to retain them as receive for to return again to visible object to help us to apprehend this matter if the organs or faculties of perception like wax overhardened with cold will not receive the impression of the seal from the usual impulse wont to imprint it or like wax of a temper too soft will not hold it well when well imprint or else suppose the wax of a temper fit but the seal not apply with a sufficient force to make a clear impression in any of these case the print leave by the seal will be obscure this i suppose need no application to make it plainer distinct and confuse what as a clear idea be that whereof the mind have such a full and evident perception as it do receive from an outward object operate duly on a welldisposed organ so a distinct idea be that wherein the mind perceive a difference from all other and a confuse idea be such an one as be not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it ought to be different objection if no idea be confuse but such as be not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it should be different it will be hard may any one say to find anywhere a confuse idea for let any idea be as it will it can be no other but such as the mind perceive it to be and that very perception sufficiently distinguish it from all other ideas which can not be other ie different without be perceive to be so no idea therefore can be undistinguishable from another from which it ought to be different unless you would have it different from itself for from all other it be evidently different confusion of ideas be in reference to their name to remove this difficulty and to help us to conceive aright what it be that make the confusion ideas be at any time chargeable with we must consider that things rank under distinct name be suppose different enough to be distinguish that so each sort by its peculiar name may be mark and discourse of apart upon any occasion and there be nothing more evident than that the greatest part of different name be suppose to stand for different things now every idea a man have be visibly what it be and distinct from all other ideas but itself that which make it confuse be when it be such that it may as well be call by another name as that which it be express by the difference which keep the things to be rank under those two different name distinct and make some of them belong rather to the one and some of them to the other of those name be leave out and so the distinction which be intend to be keep up by those different name be quite lose default which make this confusion the default which usually occasion this confusion i think be chiefly these follow complex ideas make up of too few simple ones first when any complex idea for it be complex ideas that be most liable to confusion be make up of too small a number of simple ideas and such only as be common to other things whereby the differences that make it deserve a different name be leave out thus he that have an idea make up of barely the simple ones of a beast with spot have but a confuse idea of a leopard it not be thereby sufficiently distinguish from a lynx and several other sort of beasts that be spot so that such an idea though it hath the peculiar name leopard be not distinguishable from those design by the name lynx or panther and may as well come under the name lynx as leopard how much the custom of define of word by general term contribute to make the ideas we would express by them confuse and undetermined i leave others to consider this be evident that confuse ideas be such as render the use of word uncertain and take away the benefit of distinct name when the ideas for which we use different term have not a difference answerable to their distinct name and so can not be distinguish by them there it be that they be truly confuse their simple ones jumble disorderly together secondly another fault which make our ideas confuse be when though the particulars that make up any idea be in number enough yet they be so jumble together that it be not easily discernible whether it more belong to the name that be give it than to any other there be nothing properer to make us conceive this confusion than a sort of picture usually show as surprise piece of art wherein the colour as they be lay by the pencil on the table itself mark out very odd and unusual figure and have no discernible order in their position this draught thus make up of part wherein no symmetry nor order appear be in itself no more a confuse thing than the picture of a cloudy sky wherein though there be as little order of colour or figure to be find yet nobody think it a confuse picture what be it then that make it be think confuse since the want of symmetry do not as it be plain it do not for another draught make barely in imitation of this could not be call confuse i answer that which make it be think confuse be the apply it to some name to which it do no more discernibly belong than to some other vg when it be say to be the picture of a man or caesar then any one with reason count it confuse because it be not discernible in that state to belong more to the name man or caesar than to the name baboon or pompey which be suppose to stand for different ideas from those signify by man or caesar but when a cylindrical mirror place right have reduce those irregular line on the table into their due order and proportion then the confusion cease and the eye presently see that it be a man or caesar ie that it belong to those name and that it be sufficiently distinguishable from a baboon or pompey ie from the ideas signify by those name just thus it be with our ideas which be as it be the picture of things no one of these mental draught however the part be put together can be call confuse for they be plainly discernible as they be till it be rank under some ordinary name to which it can not be discern to belong any more than it do to some other name of an allow different signification their simple ones mutable and undetermined thirdly a third defect that frequently give the name of confuse to our ideas be when any one of them be uncertain and undetermined thus we may observe men who not forbear to use the ordinary word of their language till they have learn their precise signification change the idea they make this or that term stand for almost as often as they use it he that do this out of uncertainty of what he should leave out or put into his idea of church or idolatry every time he think of either and hold not steady to any one precise combination of ideas that make it up be say to have a confuse idea of idolatry or the church though this be still for the same reason as the former viz because a mutable idea if we will allow it to be one idea can not belong to one name rather than another and so lose the distinction that distinct name be design for confusion without reference to name hardly conceivable by what have be say we may observe how much name as suppose steady sign of things and by their difference to stand for and keep things distinct that in themselves be different be the occasion of denominate ideas distinct or confuse by a secret and unobserved reference the mind make of its ideas to such name this perhaps will be fuller understand after what i say of word in the third book have be read and consider but without take notice of such a reference of ideas to distinct name as the sign of distinct things it will be hard to say what a confuse idea be and therefore when a man design by any name a sort of things or any one particular thing distinct from all others the complex idea he annex to that name be the more distinct the more particular the ideas be and the greater and more determinate the number and order of them be whereof it be make up for the more it have of these the more it have still of the perceivable differences whereby it be keep separate and distinct from all ideas belong to other name even those that approach nearest to it and thereby all confusion with them be avoid confusion concern always two ideas confusion make it a difficulty to separate two things that should be separate concern always two ideas and those most which most approach one another whenever therefore we suspect any idea to be confuse we must examine what other it be in danger to be confound with or which it can not easily be separate from and that will always be find an idea belong to another name and so should be a different thing from which yet it be not sufficiently distinct be either the same with it or make a part of it or at least as properly call by that name as the other it be rank under and so keep not that difference from that other idea which the different name import cause of confuse ideas this i think be the confusion proper to ideas which still carry with it a secret reference to name at least if there be any other confusion of ideas this be that which most of all disorder mens thoughts and discourse ideas as rank under name be those that for the most part men reason of within themselves and always those which they commune about with others and therefore where there be suppose two different ideas mark by two different name which be not as distinguishable as the sound that stand for them there never fail to be confusion and where any ideas be distinct as the ideas of those two sound they be mark by there can be between them no confusion the way to prevent it be to collect and unite into one complex idea as precisely as be possible all those ingredients whereby it be differenced from others and to them so unite in a determinate number and order apply steadily the same name but this neither accommodate mens ease or vanity nor serve any design but that of naked truth which be not always the thing aim at such exactness be rather to be wish than hop for and since the loose application of name to undetermined variable and almost no ideas serve both to cover our own ignorance as well as to perplex and confound others which go for learn and superiority in knowledge it be no wonder that most men should use it themselves whilst they complain of it in others though i think no small part of the confusion to be find in the notions of men might by care and ingenuity be avoid yet i be far from conclude it everywhere wilful some ideas be so complex and make up of so many part that the memory do not easily retain the very same precise combination of simple ideas under one name much less be we able constantly to divine for what precise complex idea such a name stand in another man use of it from the first of these follow confusion in a man own reason and opinions within himself from the latter frequent confusion in discourse and argue with others but have more at large treat of word their defect and abuse in the follow book i shall here say no more of it complex ideas may be distinct in one part and confuse in another our complex ideas be make up of collections and so variety of simple ones may ac cordingly be very clear and distinct in one part and very obscure and confuse in another in a man who speak of a chiliaedron or a body of a thousand side the ideas of the figure may be very confuse though that of the number be very distinct so that he be able to discourse and demonstrate concern that part of his complex idea which depend upon the number of thousand he be apt to think he have a distinct idea of a chiliaedron though it be plain he have no precise idea of its figure so as to distinguish it by that from one that have but side the not observe whereof cause no small error in mens thoughts and confusion in their discourse this if not heed cause confusion in our argue he that think he have a distinct idea of the figure of a chiliaedron let him for trial sake take another parcel of the same uniform matter viz gold or wax of an equal bulk and make it into a figure of side he will i doubt not be able to distinguish these two ideas one from another by the number of side and reason and argue distinctly about them whilst he keep his thoughts and reason to that part only of these ideas which be contain in their number as that the side of the one could be divide into two equal number and of the others not c but when he go about to distinguish them by their figure he will there be presently at a loss and not be able i think to frame in his mind two ideas one of them distinct from the other by the bare figure of these two piece of gold as he could if the same parcel of gold be make one into a cube the other a figure of five side in which incomplete ideas we be very apt to impose on ourselves and wrangle with others especially where they have particular and familiar name for be satisfy in that part of the idea which we have clear and the name which be familiar to us be apply to the whole contain that part also which be imperfect and obscure we be apt to use it for that confuse part and draw deductions from it in the obscure part of its signification as confidently as we do from the other instance in eternity have frequently in our mouth the name eternity we be apt to think we have a positive comprehensive idea of it which be as much as to say that there be no part of that duration which be not clearly contain in our idea it be true that he that think so may have a clear idea of duration he may also have a clear idea of a very great length of duration he may also have a clear idea of the comparison of that great one with still a greater but it not be possible for him to include in his idea of any duration let it be as great as it will the whole extent together of a duration where he suppose no end that part of his idea which be still beyond the bound of that large duration he represent to his own thoughts be very obscure and un determine and hence it be that in dispute and reason concern eternity or any other infinite we be very apt to blunder and involve ourselves in manifest absurdities infinite divisibility of matter in matter we have no clear ideas of the smallness of part much beyond the smallest that occur to any of our sense and therefore when we talk of the divisibility of matter in infinitum though we have clear ideas of division and divisibility and have also clear ideas of part make out of a whole by division yet we have but very obscure and confuse ideas of corpuscles or minute body so to be divide when by former divisions they be reduce to a smallness much exceed the perception of any of our sense and so all that we have clear and distinct ideas of be of what division in general or abstractedly be and the relation of totum and par but of the bulk of the body to be thus infinitely divide after certain progressions i think we have no clear nor distinct idea at all for i ask any one whether take the smallest atom of dust he ever saw he have any distinct idea bat still the number which concern not extension betwixt the th and the th part of it or if he think he can refine his ideas to that degree without lose sight of them let him add ten cypher to each of those number such a degree of smallness be not unreasonable to be suppose since a division carry on so far bring it no nearer the end of infinite division than the first division into two halve do i must confess for my part i have no clear distinct ideas of the differ ent bulk or extension of those body have but a very obscure one of either of them so that i think when we talk of division of body in infinitum our idea of their distinct bulk which be the subject and foundation of division come after a little progression to be confound and almost lose in obscurity for that idea which be to represent only bigness must be very obscure and confuse which we can not distinguish from one ten time as big but only by number so that we have clear distinct ideas we may say of ten and one but no distinct ideas of two such extensions it be plain from hence that when we talk of infinite divisibility of body or extension our distinct and clear ideas be only of number but the clear distinct ideas of extension after some progress of division be quite lose and of such minute part we have no distinct ideas at all but it return as all our ideas of infinite do at last to that of number always to be add but thereby never amount to any distinct idea of actual infinite part we have it be true a clear idea of division as often as we think of it but thereby we have no more a clear idea of infinite part in matter than we have a clear idea of an infinite number by be able still to add new number to any assign number we have endless divisibility give us no more a clear and distinct idea of actually infinite part than endless addibility if i may so speak give us a clear and distinct idea of an actually infinite number they both be only in a power still of increase the number be it already as great as it will so that of what remain to be add wherein consist the infinity we have but an obscure imperfect and confuse idea from or about which we can argue or reason with no certainty or clearness no more than we can in arithmetic about a number of which we have no such distinct idea as we have of or but only this relative obscure one that compare to any other it be still bigger and we have no more a clear positive idea of it when we say or conceive it be bigger or more than than if we should say it be bigger than or have no nearer a proportion to the end of addition or number than for he that add only to and so proceed shall as soon come to the end of all addition as he that add to and so likewise in eternity he that have an idea of but four years have as much a positive complete idea of eternity as he that have one of of years for what remain of eternity beyond either of these two number of years be as clear to the one as the other ie neither of them have any clear positive idea of it at all for he that add only years to and so on shall as soon reach eternity as he that add of years and so on or if he please double the increase as often as he will the remain aby be still as far beyond the end of all these progressions as it be from the length of a day or an hour for nothing finite bear any proportion to infinite and therefore our ideas which be all finite can not bear any thus it be also in our idea of extension when we increase it by addition as well as when we diminish it by division and would enlarge our thoughts to infinite space after a few double of those ideas of extension which be the largest we be accustom to have we lose the clear distinct idea of that space it become a confusedly great one with a surplus of still greater about which when we would argue or reason we shall always find ourselves at a loss confuse ideas in our argue and deductions from that part of them which be confuse always lead us into confusion of real and fantastical ideas ideas consider in reference to their archetypes besides what we have already mention concern ideas other considerations belong to them in reference to things from whence they be take or which they may be suppose to represent and thus i think they may come under a threefold distinction and be first either real or fantastical secondly adequate or inadequate thirdly true or false first by real ideas i mean such as have a foundation in nature such as have a conformity with the real be and existence of things or with their archetypes fantastical or chimerical i call such as have no founda tion in nature nor have any conformity with that reality of be to which they be tacitly refer as to their archetypes if we examine the several sort of ideas before mention we shall find that simple ideas be all real appearances of things first our simple ideas be all real all agree to the reality of things not that they be all of them the image or representations of what do exist the contrary whereof in all but the primary qualities of body hath be already show but though whiten and coldness be no more in snow than pain be yet those ideas of whiten and coldness pain c be in us the effect of power in things without us ordain by our maker to produce in us such sensations they be real ideas in us whereby we distinguish the qualities that be really in things themselves for these several appearances be design to be the mark whereby we be to know and distinguish things which we have to do with our ideas do as well serve us to that purpose and be as real distinguish character whether they be only constant effect or else exact resemblances of something in the things themselves the reality lie in that steady correspondence they have with the distinct constitutions of real be but whether they answer to those constitutions as to cause or pattern it matter not it suffice that they be constantly produce by them and thus our simple ideas be all real and true because they answer and agree to those power of things which produce them in our mind that be all that be requisite to make them real and not fictions at pleasure for in simple ideas as have be show the mind be wholly confine to the operation of things upon it and can make to itself no simple idea more than what it have receive complex ideas be voluntary combinations though the mind be wholly passive in respect of its simple ideas yet i think we may say it be not so in respect of its complex ideas for those be combinations of simple ideas put together and unite under one general name it be plain that the mind of man use some kind of liberty in form those complex ideas how else come it to pass that one man idea of gold or justice be differ ent from anothers but because he have put in or leave out of his some simple idea which the other have not the question then be which of these be real and which barely imaginary combinations what collections agree to the reality of things and what not and to this i say that mix modes and relations make of consistent ideas be real secondly mix modes and relations have no other reality but what they have in the mind of men there be nothing more require to this kind of ideas to make them real but that they be so frame that there be a possibility of exist conformable to them these ideas themselves be archetypes can not differ from their archetypes and so can not be chimerical unless any one will jumble together in them inconsistent ideas indeed as any of them have the name of a know language assign to them by which he that have them in his mind would signify them to others so bare possibility of exist be not enough they must have a conformity to the ordinary signification of the name that be give them that they may not be think fantastical as if a man would give the name of justice to that idea which common use call liberality but this fantasticalness relate more to propriety of speech than reality of ideas for a man to be undisturbed in danger sedately to consider what be fittest to be do and to execute it steadily be a mix mode or a complex idea of an action which may exist but to be undisturbed in danger without use ones reason or industry be what be also possible to be and so be as real an idea as the other though the first of these have the name courage give to it may in respect of that name be a right or wrong idea but the other whilst it have not a common receive name of any know language assign to it be not capable of any deformity be make with no reference to anything but itself complex ideas of substances be real when they agree with the existence of things thirdly our complex ideas of substances be make all of them in reference to things exist without us and intend to be representations of substances as they really be be no further real than as they be such combinations of simple ideas as be really unite and coexist in things without us on the contrary those be fantastical which be make up of such collections of simple ideas as be really never unite never be find together in any substance vg a rational creature consist of a horse head join to a body of human shape or such as the centaurs be describe or a body yellow very malleable fusible and fix but lighter than common water or an uniform unorganized body consist as to sense all of similar part with perception and voluntary motion join to it whether such substances as these can possibly exist or no it be probable we do not know but be that as it will these ideas of substances be make conformable to no pattern exist that we know and consist of such collections of ideas as no substance ever show us unite together they ought to pass with us for barely imaginary but much more be those complex ideas so which contain in them any inconsistency or contradiction of their part of adequate and inadequate ideas adequate ideas be such as perfectly represent their archetypes of our real ideas some be adequate and some be inadequate those i call adequate which perfectly represent those archetypes which the mind suppose them take from which it intend them to stand for and to which it refer them inadequate ideas be such which be but a partial or incomplete representation of those archetypes to which they be refer upon which account it be plain simple ideas all adequate first that all our simple ideas be adequate because be nothing but the effect of certain power in things fit and ordain by god to produce such sensations in us they can not but be correspondent and adequate to those power and we be sure they agree to the reality of things for if sugar produce in us the ideas which we call whiten and sweetness we be sure there be a power in sugar to produce those ideas in our mind or else they could not have be produce by it and so each sensation answer the power that operate on any of our sense the idea so produce be a real idea and not a fiction of the mind which have no power to produce any simple idea and can not but be adequate since it ought only to answer that power and so all simple ideas be adequate it be true the things produce in us these simple ideas be but few of them denominate by us as if they be only the cause of them but as if those ideas be real be in them for though fire be call painful to the touch whereby be signify the power of produce in us the idea of pain yet it be denominate also light and hot as if light and heat be really something in the fire more than a power to excite these ideas in us and therefore be call qualities in or of the fire but these be nothing in truth but power to excite such ideas in us i must in that sense be understand when i speak of secondary qualities as be in things or of their ideas as be the object that excite them in us such ways of speak though accommodate to the vulgar notions without which one can not be well understand yet truly signify nothing but those power which be in things to excite certain sensations or ideas in us since be there no fit organs to receive the impressions fire make on the sight and touch nor a mind join to those organs to receive the ideas of light and heat by those impressions from the fire or sun there would yet be no more light or heat in the world than there would be pain if there be no sensible creature to feel it though the sun should continue just as it be now and mount aetna flame higher than ever it do solidity and extension and the termination of it figure with motion and rest whereof we have the ideas would be really in the world as they be whether there be any sensible be to perceive them or no and therefore we have reason to look on those as the real modifications of matter and such as be the excite cause of all our various sensations from body but this be an inquiry not belong to this place i shall enter no further into it but proceed to show what complex ideas be adequate and what not modes be all adequate secondly our complex ideas of modes be voluntary collections of simple ideas which the mind put together without reference to any real archetypes or stand pattern exist anywhere be and can not but be adequate ideas because they not be intend for copy of things really exist but for archetypes make by the mind to rank and denominate things by can not want anything they have each of them that combination of ideas and thereby that perfection which the mind intend they should so that the mind acquiesce in them and can find nothing want thus by have the idea of a figure with three side meet at three angle i have a complete idea wherein i require nothing else to make it perfect that the mind be satisfy with the perfection of this its idea be plain in that it do not conceive that any understand hath or can have a more complete or perfect idea of that thing it signify by the word triangle suppose it to exist than itself have in that complex idea of three side and three angle in which be contain all that be or can be essential to it or necessary to complete it wherever or however it exist but in our ideas of substances it be otherwise for there desire to copy things as they really do exist and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties depend we perceive our ideas attain not that perfection we intend we find they still want something we should be glad be in them and so be all inadequate but mix modes and relations be archetypes without pattern and so have nothing to represent but themselves can not but be adequate everything be so to itself he that at first put together the idea of danger perceive absence of disorder from fear sedate consideration of what be justly to be do and execute that without disturbance or be deter by the danger of it have certainly in his mind that complex idea make up of that combination and intend it to be nothing else but what be nor to have in it any other simple ideas but what it hath it could not also but be an adequate idea and lay this up in his memory with the name courage annex to it to signify to others and denominate from thence any action he should observe to agree with it have thereby a standard to measure and denominate action by as they agree to it this idea thus make and lay up for a pattern must necessarily be adequate be refer to nothing else but itself nor make by any other original but the good like and will of him that first make this combination modes in reference to settle name may be inadequate indeed another come after and in conversation learn from him the word courage may make an idea to which he give the name courage different from what the first author apply it to and have in his mind when he use it and in this case if he design that his idea in think should be conformable to the others idea as the name he use in speak be conformable in sound to his from whom he learn it his idea may be very wrong and inadequate because in this case make the other man idea the pattern of his idea in think as the other man word or sound be the pattern of his in speak his idea be so far defective and inadequate as it be distant from the archetype and pattern he refer it to and intend to express and signify by the name he use for it which name he would have to be a sign of the other man idea to which in its proper use it be primarily annex and of his own as agree to it to which if his own do not exactly correspond it be faulty and inadequate because then mean in propriety of speech to correspond to the ideas in some other mind therefore these complex ideas of modes which they be refer by the mind and intend to correspond to the ideas in the mind of some other intelligent be express by the name we apply to them they may be very deficient wrong and inadequate because they agree not to that which the mind design to be their archetype and pattern in which respect only any idea of modes can be wrong imperfect or inadequate and on this account our ideas of mix modes be the most liable to be faulty of any other but this refer more to proper speak than know right ideas of substances as refer to real essences not adequate thirdly what ideas we have of substances i have above show now those ideas have in the mind a double reference sometimes they be refer to a suppose real essence of each species of things sometimes they be only design to be picture and repre sentations in the mind of things that do exist by ideas of those qualities that be discoverable in them in both which ways these copy of those originals and archetypes be imperfect and inadequate first it be usual for men to make the name of substances stand for things as suppose to have certain real essences whereby they be of this or that species and name stand for nothing but the ideas that be in mens mind they must constantly refer their ideas to such real essences as to their archetypes that men especially such as have be breed up in the learn teach in this part of the world do suppose certain specific essences of substances which each individual in its several kinds be make conformable to and partake of be so far from need proof that it will be think strange if any one should do otherwise and thus they ordinarily apply the specific name they rank particular substances under to things as distinguish by such specific real essences who be there almost who would not take it amiss if it should be doubt whether he call himself a man with any other mean than as have the real essence of a man and yet if you demand what those real essences be it be plain men be ignorant and know them not from whence it follow that the ideas they have in their mind be refer to real essences as to archetypes which be unknown must be so far from be adequate that they can not be suppose to be any representation of them at all the complex ideas we have of substances be as it have be show certain collections of simple ideas that have be observe or suppose constantly to exist together but such a complex idea can not be the real essence of any substance for then the properties we discover in that body would depend on that complex idea and be deducible from it and their necessary connexion with it be know as all properties of a triangle depend on and as far as they be discoverable be deducible from the complex idea of three line include a space but it be plain that in our complex ideas of substances be not contain such ideas on which all the other qualities that be to be find in them do depend the common idea men have of iron be a body of a certain colour weight and hardness and a property that they look on as belong to it be malleableness but yet this property have no necessary connexion with that complex idea or any part of it and there be no more reason to think that malleableness depend on that colour weight and hardness than that colour or that weight depend on its malleableness and yet though we know nothing of these real essences there be nothing more ordinary than that men should attribute the sort of things to such essences the particular parcel of matter which make the ring i have on my finger be forwardly by most men suppose to have a real essence whereby it be gold and from whence those qualities flow which i find in it viz its peculiar colour weight hardness fusibility fixedness and change of colour upon a slight touch of mercury c this essence from which all these properties flow when i inquire into it and search after it i plainly perceive i can not discover the furthest i can go be only to presume that it be nothing but body its real essence or internal constitution on which these qualities depend can be nothing but the figure size and connexion of its solid part of neither of which have any distinct perception at all can i have any idea of its essence which be the cause that it have that particular shin yellowness a greater weight than anything i know of the same bulk and a fitness to have its colour change by the touch of quicksilver if any one will say that the real essence and internal constitution on which these properties depend be not the figure size and arrangement or connexion of its solid part but something else call its particular form i be further from have any idea of its real essence than i be before for i have an idea of figure size and situation of solid part in general though i have none of the particular figure size or put together of part whereby the qualities above mention be produce which qualities i find in that particular parcel of matter that be on my finger and not in another parcel of matter with which i cut the pen i write with but when i be tell that something besides the figure size and posture of the solid part of that body in its essence something call substantial form of that i confess i have no idea at all but only of the sound form which be far enough from an idea of its real essence or constitution the like ignorance as i have of the real essence of this particular substance i have also of the real essence of all other natural ones of which essences i confess i have no distinct ideas at all and i be apt to suppose others when they examine their own knowledge will find in themselves in this one point the same sort of ignorance because men know not the real essences of substances now then when men apply to this particular parcel of matter on my finger a general name already in use and denominate it gold do they not ordinarily or be they not understand to give it that name as belong to a particular species of body have a real internal essence by have of which essence this particular substance come to be of that species and to be call by that name if it be so as it be plain it be the name by which things be mark as have that essence must be refer primarily to that essence and consequently the idea to which that name be give must be refer also to that essence and be intend to represent it which essence since they who so use the name know not their ideas of substances must be all inadequate in that respect as not contain in them that real essence which the mind intend they should ideas of substances when regard as collections of their qualities be all inadequate secondly those who neglect that useless supposition of unknown real essences whereby they be distinguish endeavour to copy the substances that exist in the world by put together the ideas of those sensible qualities which be find coexist in them though they come much nearer a liken of them than those who imagine they know not what real specific essences yet they arrive not at perfectly adequate ideas of those substances they would thus copy into the their mind nor do those copy exactly and fully contain all that be to be find in their archetypes because those qualities and power of substances whereof we make their complex ideas be so many and various that no man complex idea contain them all that our complex ideas of substances do not contain in them all the simple ideas that be unite in the things themselves be evident in that men do rarely put into their complex idea of any substance all the simple ideas they do know to exist in it because endeavour to make the signification of their name as clear and as little cumbersome as they can they make their specific ideas of the sort of substance for the most part of a few of those simple ideas which be to be find in them but these have no original precedency or right to be put in and make the specific idea more than others that be leave out it be plain that both these ways our ideas of substances be deficient and inadequate the simple ideas whereof we make our complex ones of substances be all of them bat only the figure and bulk of some sort power which be relations to other substances we can never be sure that we know all the power that be in any one body till we have try what change it be fit to give to or receive from other substances in their several ways of application which be impossible to be try upon any one body much less upon all it be impossible we should have adequate ideas of any substance make up of a collection of all its properties their power usually make up our complex ideas of substances whosoever first light on a parcel of that sort of substance we denote by the word gold could not rationally take the bulk and figure he observe in that lump to depend on its real essence or internal constitution therefore those never go into his idea of that species of body but its peculiar colour perhaps and weight be the first he abstract from it to make the complex idea of that species which both be but power the one to affect our eye after such a manner and to produce in us that idea we call yellow and the other to force upwards any other body of equal bulk they be put into a pair of equal scale one against another another perhaps add to these the ideas of fusibility and fixedness two other passive power in relation to the operation of fire upon it another its ductility and solubility in aqua regia two other power relate to the operation of other body in change its outward figure or separation of it into insensible part these or part of these put together usually make the complex idea in mens mind of that sort of body we call gold substances have innumerable power not contain in our complex ideas of them but no one who hath consider the properties of body in general or this sort in particular can doubt that this call gold have infinite other properties not contain in that complex idea some who have examine this species more accurately could i believe enumerate ten time as many properties in gold all of them as inseparable from its internal constitution as its colour or weight and it be probable if any one know all the properties that be by divers men know of this metal there would be an hundred time as many ideas go to the complex idea of gold as any one man yet have in his and yet perhaps that not be the thousandth part of what be to be discover in it the change that that one body be apt to receive and make in other body upon a due application exceed far not only what we know but what we be apt to imagine which will not appear so much a paradox to any one who will but consider how far men be yet from know all the properties of that one no very compound figure a triangle though it be no small number that be already by mathematicians discover of it ideas of substances be get only by collect their qualities be all inadequate so that all our complex ideas of substances be imperfect and inadequate which would be so also in mathematical figure if we be to have our complex ideas of them only by collect their properties in reference to other figure how uncertain and imperfect would our ideas be of an ellipsis if we have no other idea of it but some few of its properties whereas have in our plain idea the whole essence of that figure we from thence discover those properties and demonstratively see how they flow and be inseparable from it simple ideas ektupa and adequate thus the mind have three sort of abstract ideas or nominal essences first simple ideas which be ektupa or copy but yet certainly adequate because be intend to express nothing but the power in things to produce in the mind such a sensation that sensation when it be produce can not but be the effect of that power so the paper i write on have the power in the light i speak accord to the common notion of light to produce in men the sensation which i call white it can not but be the effect of such a power in something without the mind since the mind have not the power to produce any such idea in itself and be mean for nothing else but the effect of such a power that simple idea be real and adequate the sensation of white in my mind be the effect of that power which be in the paper to produce it be perfectly adequate to that power or else that power would produce a different idea ideas of substances be ektupa and inadequate secondly the complex ideas of substances be ectypes copy too but not perfect ones not adequate which be very evident to the mind in that it plainly perceive that whatever collection of simple ideas it make of any substance that exist it can not be sure that it exactly answer all that be in that substance since not have try all the operations of all other substances upon it and find all the alterations it would receive from or cause in other substances it can not have an exact adequate collection of all its active and passive capacities and so not have an adequate complex idea of the power of any substance exist and its relations which be that sort of complex idea of substances we have and after all if we would have and actually have in our complex idea an exact collection of all the secondary qualities or power of any substance we should not yet thereby have an idea of the essence of that thing for since the power or qualities that be observable by us be not the real essence of that substance but depend on it and flow from it any collection whatsoever of these qualities can not be the real essence of that thing whereby it be plain that our ideas of substances be not adequate be not what the mind intend them to be besides a man have no idea of substance in general nor know what substance be in itself ideas of modes and relations be archetypes and can not be adequate thirdly complex ideas of modes and relations be originals and archetypes be not copy nor make after the pattern of any real existence to which the mind intend them to be conformable and exactly to answer these be such collections of simple ideas that the mind itself put together and such collections that each of them contain in it precisely all that the mind intend that it should they be archetypes and essences of modes that may exist and so be design only for and belong only to such modes as when they do exist have an exact conformity with those complex ideas the ideas therefore of modes and relations can not but be adequate of true and false ideas truth and falsehood properly belong to proposition not to ideas though truth and falsehood belong in propriety of speech only to proposition yet ideas be oftentimes term true or false as what word be there that be not use with great latitude and with some deviation from their strict and proper significations though i think that when ideas themselves be term true or false there be still some secret or tacit proposition which be the foundation of that denomination as we shall see if we examine the particular occasion wherein they come to be call true or false in all which we shall find some kind of affirmation or negation which be the reason of that denomination for our ideas be nothing but bare appearances or perceptions in our mind can not properly and simply in themselves be say to be true or false no more than a single name of anything can be say to be true or false ideas and word may be say to be true inasmuch as they really be ideas and word indeed both ideas and word may be say to be true in a metaphysical sense of the word truth as all other things that any way exist be say to be true ie really to be such as they exist though in things call true even in that sense there be perhaps a secret reference to our ideas look upon as the standards of that truth which amount to a mental proposition though it be usually not take notice of no idea as an appearance in the mind either true or false but it be not in that metaphysical sense of truth which we inquire here when we examine whether our ideas be capable of be true or false but in the more ordinary acceptation of those word and so i say that the ideas in our mind be only so many perceptions or appearances there none of them be false the idea of a centaur have no more falsehood in it when it appear in our mind than the name centaur have falsehood in it when it be pronounce by our mouth or write on paper for truth or falsehood lie always in some affirmation or negation mental or verbal our ideas be not capable any of them of be false till the mind pass some judgment on them that be affirm or deny something of them ideas refer to anything extraneous to them may be true or false whenever the mind refer any of its ideas to anything extraneous to them they be then capable to be call true or false because the mind in such a reference make a tacit supposition of their conformity to that thing which supposition as it happen to be true or false so the ideas themselves come to be denominate the most usual case wherein this happen be these follow other mens ideas real existence and suppose real essences be what men usually refer their ideas to first when the mind suppose any idea it have conformable to that in other mens mind call by the same common name vg when the mind intend or judge its ideas of justice temperance religion to be the same with what other men give those name to secondly when the mind suppose any idea it have in itself to be conformable to some real existence thus the two ideas of a man and a centaur suppose to be the ideas of real substances be the one true and the other false the one have a conformity to what have really exist the other not thirdly when the mind refer any of its ideas to that real constitution and essence of anything whereon all its properties depend and thus the greatest part if not all our ideas of substances be false the cause of such reference these suppositions the mind be very apt tacitly to make concern its own ideas but yet if we will examine it we shall find it be chiefly if not only concern its abstract complex ideas for the natural tendency of the mind be towards knowledge and find that if it should proceed by and dwell upon only particular things its progress would be very slow and its work endless therefore to shorten its way to knowledge and make each perception more comprehensive the first thing it do as the foundation of the easier enlarge its knowledge either by contemplation of the things themselves that it would know or conference with others about them be to bind them into bundle and rank them so into sort that what knowledge it get of any of them it may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort and so advance by larger step in that which be its great business knowledge this as i have elsewhere show be the reason why we collect things under comprehensive ideas with name annex to them into genera and species ie into kinds and sort name of things suppose to carry in them knowledge of their essences if therefore we will warily attend to the motion of the mind and observe what course it usually take in its way to knowledge we shall i think find that the mind have get an idea which it think it may have use of either in contemplation or discourse the first thing it do be to abstract it and then get a name to it and so lay it up in its storehouse the memory as contain the essence of a sort of things of which that name be always to be the mark hence it be that we may often observe that when any one see a new thing of a kind that he know not he presently ask what it be mean by that inquiry nothing but the name as if the name carry with it the knowledge of the species or the essence of it whereof it be indeed use as the mark and be generally suppose annex to it how men suppose that their ideas must correspond to things and to the customary mean of name but this abstract idea be something in the mind between the thing that exist and the name that be give to it it be in our ideas that both the rightness of our knowledge and the propriety and intelligibleness of our speak consist and hence it be that men be so forward to suppose that the abstract ideas they have in their mind be such as agree to the things exist without them to which they be refer and be the same also to which the name they give them do by the use and propriety of that language belong for without this double conformity of their ideas they find they should both think amiss of things in themselves and talk of them unintelligibly to others simple ideas may be false in reference to others of the same name but be least liable to be so first then i say that when the truth of our ideas be judge of by the conformity they have to the ideas which other men have and commonly signify by the same name they may be any of them false but yet simple ideas be least of all liable to be so mistake because a man by his sense and every days observation may easily satisfy himself what the simple ideas be which their several name that be in common use stand for they be but few in number and such as if he doubt or mistake in he may easily rectify by the object they be to be find in therefore it be seldom that any one mistake in his name of simple ideas or apply the name red to the idea green or the name sweet to the idea bitter mush less be men apt to confound the name of ideas belong to different sense and call a colour by the name of a taste c whereby it be evident that the simple ideas they call by any name be commonly the same that others have and mean when they use the same name ideas of mix modes most liable to be false in this sense complex ideas be much more liable to be false in this respect and the complex ideas of mix modes much more than those of substances because in substances especially those which the common and unborrowed name of any language be apply to some remarkable sensible qualities serve ordinarily to distinguish one sort from another easily preserve those who take any care in the use of their word from apply them to sort of substances to which they do not at all belong but in mix modes we be much more uncertain it be not so easy to determine of several action whether they be to be call justice or cruelly liberality or prodigality and so in refer our ideas to those of other men call by the same name ours may be false and the idea in our mind which we express by the word justice may perhaps be that which ought to have another name or at least to be think false but whether or no our ideas of mix modes be more liable than any sort to be different from those of other men which be mark by the same name this at least be certain that this sort of falsehood be much more familiarly attribute to our ideas of mix modes than to any other when a man be think to have a false idea of justice or gratitude or glory it be for no other reason but that his agree not with the ideas which each of those name be the sign of in other men and why the reason whereof seem to me to be this that the abstract ideas of mix modes be mens voluntary combinations of such a precise collection of simple ideas and so the essence of each species be make by men alone whereof we have no other sensible standard exist anywhere but the name itself or the definition of that name we have nothing else to refer these our ideas of mix modes to as a standard to which we would conform them but the ideas of those who be think to use those name in their most proper significations and so as our ideas conform or differ from them they pass for true or false and thus much concern the truth and falsehood of our ideas in reference to their name as refer to real existence none of our ideas can be false but those of substances secondly as to the truth and falsehood of our ideas in reference to the real existence of things when that be make the standard of their truth none of them can be term false but only our complex ideas of substances simple ideas in this sense not false and why first our simple ideas be barely such perceptions as god have fit us to receive and give power to external object to produce in us by establish laws and ways suitable to his wisdom and goodness though incomprehensible to us their truth consist in nothing else but in such appearances as be produce in us and must be suitable to those power he have place in external object or else they could not be produce in us and thus answer those power they be what they should be true ideas nor do they become liable to any imputation of falsehood if the mind as in most men i believe it do judge these ideas to be in the things themselves for god in his wisdom have set them as mark of distinction in things whereby we may be able to discern one thing from another and so choose any of them for our use as we have occasion it alter not the nature of our simple idea whether we think that the idea of blue be in the violet itself or in our mind only and only the power of produce it by the texture of its part reflect the particles of light after a certain manner to be in the violet itself for that texture in the object by a regular and constant operation produce the same idea of blue in us it serve us to distinguish by our eye that from any other thing whether that distinguish mark as it be really in the violet be only a peculiar texture of part or else that very colour the idea whereof which be in us be the exact resemblance and it be equally from that appearance to be denominate blue whether it be that real colour or only a peculiar texture in it that cause in us that idea since the name blue note properly nothing but that mark of distinction that be in a violet discernible only by our eye whatever it consist in that be beyond our capacities distinctly to know and perhaps would be of less use to us if we have faculties to discern though one man idea of blue should be different from anothers neither would it carry any imputation of falsehood to our simple ideas if by the different structure of our organs it be so order that the same object should produce in several mens mind different ideas at the same time vg if the idea that a violet produce in one man mind by his eye be the same that a marigold produce in another man and vice versa for since this could never be know because one man mind could not pass into another man body to perceive what appearances be produce by those organs neither the ideas hereby nor the name would be at all confound or any falsehood be in either for all things that have the texture of a violet produce constantly the idea that he call blue and those which have the texture of a marigold produce constantly the idea which he as constantly call yellow whatever those appearances be in his mind he would be able as regu larly to distinguish things for his use by those appearances and understand and signify those distinctions mark by the name blue and yellow as if the appearances or ideas in his mind receive from those two flower be exactly the same with the ideas in other mens mind i be nevertheless very apt to think that the sensible ideas produce by any object in different mens mind be most commonly very near and undiscernibly alike for which opinion i think there might be many reason offer but that be besides my present business i shall not trouble my reader with them but only mind him that the contrary supposition if it could be prove be of little use either for the improvement of our knowledge or conveniency of life and so we need not trouble ourselves to examine it simple ideas can none of them be false in respect of real existence from what have be say concern our simple ideas i think it evident that our simple ideas can none of them be false in respect of things exist without us for the truth of these appearances or perceptions in our mind consist as have be say only in their be answerable to the power in external object to produce by our sense such appearances in us and each of them be in the mind such as it be suitable to the power that produce it and which alone it represent it can not upon that account or as refer to such a pattern be false blue and yellow bitter or sweet can never be false ideas these perceptions in the mind be just such as they be there answer the power appoint by god to produce them and so be truly what they be and be intend to be indeed the name may be misapply but that in this respect make no falsehood in the ideas as if a man ignorant in the english tongue should call purple scarlet modes not false can not be false in reference to essences of things secondly neither can our complex ideas of modes in reference to the essence of anything really exist be false because whatever complex ideas i have of any mode it hath no reference to any pattern exist and make by nature it be not suppose to contain in it any other ideas than what it hath nor to represent anything but such a complication of ideas as it do thus when i have the idea of such an action of a man who forbear to afford himself such meat drink and clothe and other conveniences of life as his riches and estate will be sufficient to supply and his station require i have no false idea but such an one as represent an action either as i find or imagine it and so be capable of neither truth nor falsehood but when i give the name frugality or virtue to this action then it may be call a false idea if thereby it be suppose to agree with that idea to which in propriety of speech the name of frugality doth belong or to be conformable to that law which be the standard of virtue and vice ideas of substances may be false in reference to exist things thirdly our complex ideas of substances be all refer to pattern in things themselves may be false that they be all false when look upon as the representations of the unknown essences of things be so evident that there need nothing to be say of it i shall therefore pass over that chimerical supposition and consider them as collections of simple ideas in the mind take from combinations of simple ideas exist together constantly in things of which pattern they be the suppose copy and in this reference of them to the existence of things they be false ideas when they put together simple ideas which in the real existence of things have no union as when to the shape and size that exist together in a horse be join in the same complex idea the power of bark like a dog which three ideas however put together into one in the mind be never unite in nature and this therefore may be call a false idea of a horse ideas of substances be in this respect also false when from any collection of simple ideas that do always exist together there be separate by a direct negation any other simple idea which be constantly join with them thus if to extension solidity fusibility the peculiar weightiness and yellow colour of gold any one join in his thoughts the negation of a greater degree of fixedness than be in lead or copper he may be say to have a false complex idea as well as when he join to those other simple ones the idea of perfect absolute fixedness for either way the complex idea of gold be make up of such simple ones as have no union in nature may be term false but if he leave out of this his complex idea that of fixedness quite without either actually join to or separate it from the rest in his mind it be i think to be look on as an inadequate and imperfect idea rather than a false one since though it contain not all the simple ideas that be unite in nature yet it put none together but what do really exist together truth or falsehood always suppose affirmation or negation though in compliance with the ordinary way of speak i have show in what sense and upon what grind our ideas may be sometimes call true or false yet if we will look a little nearer into the matter in all case where any idea be call true or false it be from some judgment that the mind make or be suppose to make that be true or false for truth or falsehood be never without some affirmation or negation express or tacit it be not to be find but where sign be join or separate accord to the agreement or disagreement of the things they stand for the sign we chiefly use be either ideas or word wherewith we make either mental or verbal proposition truth lie in so join or separate these representatives as the things they stand for do in themselves agree or disagree and falsehood in the contrary as shall be more fully show hereafter ideas in themselves neither true nor false any idea then which we have in our mind whether conformable or not to the existence of things or to any idea in the mind of other men can not properly for this alone be call false for these representations if they have nothing in them but what be really exist in things without can not be think false be exact representations of something nor yet if they have anything in them differ from the reality of things can they properly be say to be false representations or ideas of things they do not represent but the mistake and falsehood be but be falsewhen judge agreeable to another man idea without be so first when the mind have any idea it judge and conclude it the same that be in other mens mind signify by the same name or that it be conformable to the ordinary receive signification or definition of that word when indeed it be not which be the most usual mistake in mix modes though other ideas also be liable to it when judge to agree to real existence when they do not when it have a complex idea make up of such a collection of simple ones as nature never put together it judge it to agree to a species of creatures really exist as when it join the weight of tin to the colour fusibility and fixedness of gold when judge adequate without be so when in its complex idea it have unite a certain number of simple ideas that do really exist together in some sort of creatures but have also leave out others as much inseparable it judge this to be a perfect complete idea of a sort of things which really it be not vg have join the ideas of substance yellow malleable most heavy and fusible it take that complex idea to be the complete idea of gold when yet its peculiar fixedness and solubility in aqua regia be as inseparable from those other ideas or qualities of that body as they be one from another when judge to represent the real essence the mistake be yet greater when i judge that this complex idea contain in it the real essence of any body exist when at least it contain but some few of those properties which flow from its real essence and constitution i say only some few of those properties for those properties consist mostly in the active and passive power it have in reference to other things all that be vulgarly know of any one body of which the complex idea of that kind of things be usually make be but a very few in comparison of what a man that have several ways try and examine it know of that one sort of things and all that the most expert man know be but a few in comparison of what be really in that body and depend on its internal or essential constitution the essence of a triangle lie in a very little compass consist in a very few ideas three line include a space make up that essence but the properties that flow from this essence be more than can be easily know or enumerate so i imagine it be in substances their real essences lie in a little compass though the properties flow from that internal constitution be endless ideas when call false to conclude a man have no notion of anything without him but by the idea he have of it in his mind which idea he have a power to call by what name he please he may indeed make an idea neither answer the reason of things nor agree to the idea commonly signify by other people word but can not make a wrong or false idea of a thing which be no otherwise know to him but by the idea he have of it vg when i frame an idea of the legs arm and body of a man and join to this a horse head and neck i do not make a false idea of anything because it represent nothing without me but when i call it a man or tartar and imagine it to represent some real be without me or to be the same idea that others call by the same name in either of these case i may err and upon this account it be that it come to be term a false idea though indeed the falsehood lie not in the idea but in that tacit mental proposition wherein a conformity and resemblance be attribute to it which it have not but yet if have frame such an idea in my mind without think either that existence or the name man or tartar belong to it i will call it man or tartar i may be justly think fantastical in the name but not erroneous in my judgment nor the idea any way false more properly to be call right or wrong upon the whole matter i think that our ideas as they be consider by the mindeither in reference to the proper signification of their name or in reference to the reality of thingsmay very fitly be call right or wrong ideas accord as they agree or disagree to those pattern to which they be refer but if any one have rather call them true or false it be fit he use a liberty which every one have to call things by those name he think best though in propriety of speech truth or falsehood will i think scarce agree to them but as they some way or other virtually contain in them some mental proposition the ideas that be in a man mind simply consider can not be wrong unless complex ones wherein inconsistent part be jumble together all other ideas be in themselves right and the knowledge about them right and true knowledge but when we come to refer them to anything as to their pattern and arche type then they be capable of be wrong as far as they disagree with such archetypes of the association of ideas something unreasonable in most men there be scarce any one that do not observe something that seem odd to him and be in itself really extravagant in the opinions reason and action of other men the least flaw of this kind if at all different from his own every one be quicksighted enough to espy in another and will by the authority of reason forwardly condemn though he be guilty of much greater unreasonableness in his own tenets and conduct which he never perceive and will very hardly if at all be convince of not wholly from selflove this proceed not wholly from selflove though that have often a great hand in it men of fair mind and not give up to the overweening of selfflattery be frequently guilty of it and in many case one with amazement hear the argue and be astonish at the obstinacy of a worthy man who yield not to the evidence of reason though lay before him as clear as daylight not from education this sort of unreasonableness be usually impute to education and prejudice and for the most part truly enough though that reach not the bottom of the disease nor show distinctly enough whence it rise or wherein it lie education be often rightly assign for the cause and prejudice be a good general name for the thing itself but yet i think he ought to look a little further who would trace this sort of madness to the root it spring from and so explain it as to show whence this flaw have its original in very sober and rational mind and wherein it consist a degree of madness find in most men i shall be pardon for call it by so harsh a name as madness when it be consider that opposition to reason deserve that name and be really madness and there be scarce a man so free from it but that if he should always on all occasion argue or do as in some case he constantly do would not be think fitter for bedlam than civil conversation i do not here mean when he be under the power of an unruly passion but in the steady calm course of his life that which will yet more apologize for this harsh name and ungrateful imputation on the greatest part of mankind be that inquire a little by the bye into the nature of madness bk ii ch xi ss i find it to spring from the very same root and to depend on the very same cause we be here speak of this consideration of the thing itself at a time when i think not the least on the subject which i be now treat of suggest it to me and if this be a weakness to which all men be so liable if this be a taint which so universally infect mankind the greater care should be take to lay it open under its due name thereby to excite the greater care in its prevention and cure from a wrong connexion of ideas some of our ideas have a natural correspondence and connexion one with another it be the office and excellency of our reason to trace these and hold them together in that union and correspondence which be found in their peculiar be besides this there be another connexion of ideas wholly owe to chance or custom ideas that in themselves be not all of kin come to be so unite in some mens mind that it be very hard to separate them they always keep in company and the one no sooner at any time come into the understand but its associate appear with it and if they be more than two which be thus unite the whole gang always inseparable show themselves together this connexion make by custom this strong combination of ideas not ally by nature the mind make in itself either voluntarily or by chance and hence it come in different men to be very different accord to their different inclinations education interest c custom settle habit of think in the understand as well as of determine in the will and of motion in the body all which seem to be but train of motion in the animal spirit which once set a go continue in the same step they have use to which by often tread be wear into a smooth path and the motion in it become easy and as it be natural as far as we can comprehend think thus ideas seem to be produce in our mind or if they be not this may serve to explain their follow one another in an habitual train when once they be put into their track as well as it do to explain such motion of the body a musician use to any tune will find that let it but once begin in his head the ideas of the several note of it will follow one another orderly in his understand without any care or attention as regularly as his finger move orderly over the key of the organ to play out the tune he have begin though his unattentive thoughts be elsewhere a wander whether the natural cause of these ideas as well as of that regular dance of his finger be the motion of his animal spirit i will not determine how probable soever by this instance it appear to be so but this may help us a little to conceive of intellectual habit and of the tie together of ideas some antipathies an effect of it that there be such associations of them make by custom in the mind of most men i think nobody will question who have well consider himself or others and to this perhaps might be justly attribute most of the sympathies and antipathies observable in men which work as strongly and produce as regular effect as if they be natural and be therefore call so though they at first have no other original but the accidental connexion of two ideas which either the strength of the first impression or future indulgence so unite that they always afterwards keep company together in that man mind as if they be but one idea i say most of the antipathies i do not say all for some of them be truly natural depend upon our original constitution and be bear with us but a great part of those which be count natural would have be know to be from unheeded though perhaps early impressions or wanton fancy at first which would have be acknowledge the original of them if they have be warily observe a grow person surfeit with honey no sooner hear the name of it but his fancy immediately carry sickness and qualms to his stomach and he can not bear the very idea of it other ideas of dislike and sickness and vomit presently accompany it and he be disturb but he know from whence to date this weakness and can tell how he get this indisposition have this happen to him by an overdose of honey when a child all the same effect would have follow but the cause would have be mistake and the antipathy count natural influence of association to be watch educate young children i mention this not out of any great necessity there be in this present argument to distinguish nicely between natural and acquire antipathies but i take notice of it for another purpose viz that those who have children or the charge of their education would think it worth their while diligently to watch and carefully to prevent the undue connexion of ideas in the mind of young people this be the time most susceptible of last impressions and though those relate to the health of the body be by discreet people mind and fence against yet i be apt to doubt that those which relate more peculiarly to the mind and terminate in the understand or passions have be much less heed than the thing deserve nay those relate purely to the understand have as i suspect be by most men wholly overlook wrong connexion of ideas a great cause of errors this wrong connexion in our mind of ideas in themselves loose and independent of one another have such an influence and be of so great force to set us awry in our action as well moral as natural passions reason and notions themselves that perhaps there be not any one thing that deserve more to be look after an instance the ideas of goblins and sprites have really no more to do with darkness than light yet let but a foolish maid inculcate these often on the mind of a child and raise them there together possibly he shall never be able to separate them again so long as he live but darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas and they shall be so join that he can no more bear the one than the other another instance a man receive a sensible injury from another think on the man and that action over and over and by ruminate on them strongly or much in his mind so cement those two ideas together that he make them almost one never think on the man but the pain and displeasure he suffer come into his mind with it so that he scarce distinguish them but have as much an aversion for the one as the other thus hatreds be often beget from slight and innocent occasion and quarrel propagate and continue in the world a third instance a man have suffer pain or sickness in any place he saw his friend die in such a room though these have in nature nothing to do one with another yet when the idea of the place occur to his mind it bring the impression be once make that of the pain and displeasure with it he confound them in his mind and can as little bear the one as the other why time cure some disorder in the mind which reason can not cure when this combination be settle and while it last it be not in the power of reason to help us and relieve us from the effect of it ideas in our mind when they be there will operate accord to their natures and circumstances and here we see the cause why time cure certain affections which reason though in the right and allow to be so have not power over nor be able against them to prevail with those who be apt to hearken to it in other case the death of a child that be the daily delight of its mother eye and joy of her soul rend from her heart the whole comfort of her life and give her all the torment imaginable use the consolations of reason in this case and you be as good preach ease to one on the rack and hope to allay by rational discourse the pain of his joint tear asunder till time have by disuse separate the sense of that enjoyment and its loss from the idea of the child return to her memory all representations though ever so reasonable be in vain and therefore some in whom the union between these ideas be never dissolve spend their live in mourn and carry an incurable sorrow to their grave another instance of the effect of the association of ideas a friend of mine know one perfectly cure of madness by a very harsh and offensive operation the gentleman who be thus recover with great sense of gratitude and acknowledgment own the cure all his life after as the greatest obligation he could have receive but whatever gratitude and reason suggest to him he could never bear the sight of the operator that image bring back with it the idea of that agony which he suffer from his hand which be too mighty and intolerable for him to endure more instance many children impute the pain they endure at school to their book they be correct for so join those ideas together that a book become their aversion and they be never reconcile to the study and use of them all their live after and thus read become a torment to them which otherwise possibly they might have make the great pleasure of their live there be room convenient enough that some men can not study in and fashion of vessels which though ever so clean and commodious they can not drink out of and that by reason of some accidental ideas which be annex to them and make them offensive and who be there that hath not observe some man to flag at the appearance or in the company of some certain person not otherwise superior to him but because have once on some occasion get the ascendant the idea of authority and distance go along with that of the person and he that have be thus subject be not able to separate them a curious instance instance of this kind be so plentiful everywhere that if i add one more it be only for the pleasant oddness of it it be of a young gentleman who have learn to dance and that to great perfection there happen to stand an old trunk in the room where he learn the idea of this remarkable piece of household stuff have so mix itself with the turn and step of all his dance that though in that chamber he could dance excellently well yet it be only whilst that trunk be there nor could he perform well in any other place unless that or some such other trunk have its due position in the room if this story shall be suspect to be dress up with some comical circumstances a little beyond precise nature i answer for myself that i have it some years since from a very sober and worthy man upon his own knowledge as i report it and i dare say there be very few inquisitive persons who read this who have not meet with account if not examples of this nature that may parallel or at least justify this influence of association on intellectual habit intellectual habit and defect this way contract be not less frequent and powerful though less observe let the ideas of be and matter be strongly join either by education or much think whilst these be still combine in the mind what notions what reason will there be about separate spirit let custom from the very childhood have join figure and shape to the idea of god and what absurdities will that mind be liable to about the deity let the idea of infallibility be inseparably join to any person and these two constantly together possess the mind and then one body in two place at once shall unexamined be swallow for a certain truth by an implicit faith whenever that imagine infallible person dictate and demand assent without inquiry observable in the opposition between different sects of philosophy and of religion some such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be find to establish the irreconcilable opposition between different sects of philosophy and religion for we can not imagine every one of their followers to impose wilfully on himself and knowingly refuse truth offer by plain reason interest though it do a great deal in the case yet can not be think to work whole societies of men to so universal a perverseness as that every one of them to a man should knowingly maintain falsehood some at least must be allow to do what all pretend to ie to pursue truth sincerely and therefore there must be something that blind their understand and make them not see the falsehood of what they embrace for real truth that which thus captivate their reason and lead men of sincerity blindfold from common sense will when examine be find to be what we be speak of some independent ideas of no alliance to one another be by education custom and the constant din of their party so couple in their mind that they always appear there together and they can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they be but one idea and they operate as if they be so this give sense to jargon demonstration to absurdities and consistency to nonsense and be the foundation of the greatest i have almost say of all the errors in the world or if it do not reach so far it be at least the most dangerous one since so far as it obtain it hinder men from see and examine when two things in themselves disjoin appear to the sight constantly unite if the eye see these things rivet which be loose where will you begin to rectify the mistake that follow in two ideas that they have be accustom so to join in their mind as to substitute one for the other and as i be apt to think often without perceive it themselves this whilst they be under the deceit of it make them incapable of conviction and they applaud themselves as zealous champion for truth when indeed they be contend for error and the confusion of two different ideas which a customary connexion of them in their mind hath to them make in effect but one fill their head with false view and their reason with false consequences conclusion have thus give an account of the original sort and extent of our ideas with several other considerations about these i know not whether i may say instrument or materials of our knowledge the method i at first propose to myself would now require that i should immediately proceed to show what use the understand make of them and what knowledge we have by them this be that which in the first general view i have of this subject be all that i think i should have to do but upon a nearer approach i find that there be so close a connexion between ideas and word and our abstract ideas and general word have so constant a relation one to another that it be impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge which all consist in proposition without consider first the nature use and signification of language which therefore must be the business of the next book of word of word or language in general man fit to form articulate sound god have design man for a sociable creature make him not only with an inclination and under a necessity to have fellowship with those of his own kind but furnish him also with language which be to be the great instrument and common tie of society man therefore have by nature his organs so fashion as to be fit to frame articulate sound which we call word but this be not enough to produce language for parrot and several other bird will be teach to make articulate sound distinct enough which yet by no mean be capable of language to use these sound as sign of ideas besides articulate sound therefore it be further necessary that he should be able to use these sound as sign of internal conceptions and to make them stand as mark for the ideas within his own mind whereby they might be make know to others and the thoughts of mens mind be convey from one to another to make them general sign but neither be this sufficient to make word so useful as they ought to be it be not enough for the perfection of language that sound can be make sign of ideas unless those sign can be so make use of as to comprehend several particular things for the multiplication of word would have perplex their use have every particular thing need of a distinct name to be signify by to remedy this inconvenience language have yet a further improvement in the use of general term whereby one word be make to mark a multitude of particular existences which advantageous use of sound be obtain only by the difference of the ideas they be make sign of those name become general which be make to stand for general ideas and those remain particular where the ideas they be use for be particular to make them signify the absence of positive ideas besides these name which stand for ideas there be other word which men make use of not to signify any idea but the want or absence of some ideas simple or complex or all ideas together such as be nihil in latin and in english ignorance and barrenness all which negative or privative word can not be say properly to belong to or signify no ideas for then they would be perfectly insignificant sound but they relate to positive ideas and signify their absence word ultimately derive from such as signify sensible ideas it may also lead us a little towards the original of all our notions and knowledge if we remark how great a dependence our word have on common sensible ideas and how those which be make use of to stand for action and notions quite remove from sense have their rise from thence and from obvious sensible ideas be transfer to more abstruse significations and make to stand for ideas that come not under the cognizance of our sense vg to imagine apprehend comprehend adhere conceive instil disgust disturbance tranquillity c be all word take from the operations of sensible things and apply to certain modes of think spirit in its primary signification be breath angel a messenger and i doubt not but if we could trace them to their source we should find in all languages the name which stand for things that fall not under our sense to have have their first rise from sensible ideas by which we may give some kind of guess what kind of notions they be and whence derive which fill their mind who be the first beginners of languages and how nature even in the name of things unawares suggest to men the originals and principles of all their knowledge whilst to give name that might make know to others any operations they felt in themselves or any other ideas that come not under their sense they be fain to borrow word from ordinary know ideas of sensation by that mean to make others the more easily to conceive those operations they experiment in themselves which make no outward sensible appearances and then when they have get know and agree name to signify those internal operations of their own mind they be sufficiently furnish to make know by word all their other ideas since they could consist of nothing but either of outward sensible perceptions or of the inward operations of their mind about them we have as have be prove no ideas at all but what originally come either from sensible object without or what we feel within ourselves from the inward work of our own spirit of which we be conscious to ourselves within distribution of subject to be treat of but to understand better the use and force of language as subservient to instruction and knowledge it will be convenient to consider first to what it be that name in the use of language be immediately apply secondly since all except proper name be general and so stand not particularly for this or that single thing but for sort and rank of things it will be necessary to consider in the next place what the sort and kinds or if you rather like the latin name what the species and genera of things be wherein they consist and how they come to be make these be as they ought well look into we shall the better come to find the right use of word the natural advantage and defect of language and the remedy that ought to be use to avoid the inconvenience of obscurity or uncertainty in the signification of word without which it be impossible to discourse with any clearness or order concern knowledge which be conversant about proposition and those most commonly universal ones have greater connexion with word than perhaps be suspect these considerations therefore shall be the matter of the follow chapters of the signification of word word be sensible sign necessary for communication of ideas man though he have great variety of thoughts and such from which others as well as himself might receive profit and delight yet they be all within his own breast invisible and hide from others nor can of themselves be make to appear the comfort and advantage of society not be to be have without com munication of thoughts it be necessary that man should find out some external sensible sign whereof those invisible ideas which his thoughts be make up of might be make know to others for this purpose nothing be so fit either for plenty or quickness as those articulate sound which with so much ease and variety he find himself able to make thus we may conceive how word which be by nature so well adapt to that purpose come to be make use of by men as the sign of their ideas not by any natural connexion that there be between particular articulate sound and certain ideas for then there would be but one language amongst all men but by a voluntary imposition whereby such a word be make arbitrarily the mark of such an idea the use then of word be to be sensible mark of ideas and the ideas they stand for be their proper and immediate signification word in their immediate signification be the sensible sign of his ideas who use them the use men have of these mark be either to record their own thoughts for the assistance of their own memory or as it be to bring out their ideas and lay them before the view of others word in their primary or immediate signification stand for nothing but the ideas in the mind of him that use them how imperfectly soever or carelessly those ideas be collect from the things which they be suppose to represent when a man speak to another it be that he may be understand and the end of speech be that those sound as mark may make know his ideas to the hearer that then which word be the mark of be the ideas of the speaker nor can any one apply them as mark immediately to anything else but the ideas that he himself hath for this would be to make them sign of his own conceptions and yet apply them to other ideas which would be to make them sign and not sign of his ideas at the same time and so in effect to have no signification at all word be voluntary sign they can not be voluntary sign impose by him on things he know not that would be to make them sign of nothing sound without signification a man can not make his word the sign either of qualities in things or of conceptions in the mind of another whereof he have none in his own till he have some ideas of his own he can not suppose them to correspond with the conceptions of another man nor can he use any sign for them of another man nor can he use any sign for them for thus they would be the sign of he know not what which be in truth to be the sign of nothing but when he represent to himself other mens ideas by some of his own if he consent to give them the same name that other men do it be still to his own ideas to ideas that he have and not to ideas that he have not examples of this this be so necessary in the use of language that in this respect the know and the ignorant the learn and the unlearn use the word they speak with any mean all alike they in every man mouth stand for the ideas he have and which he would express by them a child have take notice of nothing in the metal he hear call gold but the bright shin yellow colour he apply the word gold only to his own idea of that colour and nothing else and therefore call the same colour in a peacocks tail gold another that hath better observe add to shin yellow great weight and then the sound gold when he use it stand for a complex idea of a shin yellow and a very weighty substance another add to those qualities fusibility and then the word gold signify to him a body bright yellow fusible and very heavy another add malleability each of these use equally the word gold when they have occasion to express the idea which they have apply it to but it be evident that each can apply it only to his own idea nor can he make it stand as a sign of such a complex idea as he have not word be often secretly refer first to the ideas suppose to be in other mens mind but though word as they be use by men can properly and immediately signify nothing but the ideas that be in the mind of the speaker yet they in their thoughts give them a secret reference to two other things first they suppose their word to be mark of the ideas in the mind also of other men with whom they communicate for else they should talk in vain and could not be understand if the sound they apply to one idea be such as by the hearer be apply to another which be to speak two languages but in this men stand not usually to examine whether the idea they and those they discourse with have in their mind be the same but think it enough that they use the word as they imagine in the common acceptation of that language in which they suppose that the idea they make it a sign of be precisely the same to which the understand men of that country apply that name to the reality of things secondly because men would not be think to talk barely of their own imagination but of things as really they be therefore they often suppose the word to stand also for the reality of things but this relate more particularly to substances and their name as perhaps the former do to simple ideas and modes we shall speak of these two different ways of apply word more at large when we come to treat of the name of mix modes and substances in particular though give me leave here to say that it be a pervert the use of word and bring unavoidable obscurity and confusion into whenever we make them stand for anything but those ideas we have in our own mind word by use readily excite ideas of their object concern word also it be further to be consider first that they be immediately the sign of mens ideas and by that mean the instrument whereby men communicate their conceptions and express to one another those thoughts and imaginations they have within their own their own breast there come by constant use to be such a connexion between certain sound and the ideas they stand for that the name hear almost as readily excite certain ideas as if the object themselves which be apt to produce them do actually affect the sense which be manifestly so in all obvious sensible qualities and in all substances that frequently and familiarly occur to us word be often use without signification and why secondly that though the proper and immediate signification of word be ideas in the mind of the speaker yet because by familiar use from our cradle we come to learn certain articulate sound very perfectly and have them readily on our tongue and always at hand in our memories but yet be not always careful to ex amine or settle their significations perfectly it often happen that men even when they would apply themselves to an attentive consideration do set their thoughts more on word than things nay because word be many of them learn before the ideas be know for which they stand therefore some not only children but men speak several word no otherwise than parrot do only because they have learn them and have be accustom to those sound but so far as word be of use and signification so far be there a constant connexion between the sound and the idea and a designation that the one stand for the other without which application of them they be nothing but so much insignificant noise their signification perfectly arbitrary not the consequence of a natural connexion word by long and familiar use as have be say come to excite in men certain ideas so constantly and readily that they be apt to suppose a natural connexion between them but that they signify only mens peculiar ideas and that by a perfect arbitrary imposition be evident in that they often fail to excite in others even that use the same language the same ideas we take them to be sign of and every man have so inviolable a liberty to make word stand for what ideas he please that no one hath the power to make others have the same ideas in their mind that he have when they use the same word that he do and therefore the great augustus himself in the possession of that power which rule the world acknowledge he could not make a new latin word which be as much as to say that he could not arbitrarily appoint what idea any sound should be a sign of in the mouth and common language of his subject it be true common use by a tacit consent appropriate certain sound to certain ideas in all languages which so far limit the signification of that sound that unless a man apply it to the same idea he do not speak properly and let me add that unless a man word excite the same ideas in the hearer which he make them stand for in speak he do not speak intelligibly but whatever be the consequence of any man use of word differently either from their general mean or the particular sense of the person to whom he address them this be certain their signification in his use of them be limit to his ideas and they can be sign of nothing else of general term the greatest part of word be general term all things that exist be particulars it may perhaps be think reasonable that word which ought to be conform to things should be so tooi mean in their signification but yet we find quite the contrary the far greatest part of word that make all languages be general term which have not be the effect of neglect or chance but of reason and necessity that every particular thing should have a name for itself be impossible first it be impossible that every particular thing should have a distinct peculiar name for the signification and use of word depend on that connexion which the mind make between its ideas and the sound it use as sign of them it be necessary in the application of name to things that the mind should have distinct ideas of the things and retain also the particular name that belong to every one with its peculiar appropriation to that idea but it be beyond the power of human capacity to frame and retain distinct ideas of all the particular things we meet with every bird and beast men saw every tree and plant that affect the sense could not find a place in the most capacious understand if it be look on as an instance of a prodigious memory that some general have be able to call every soldier in their army by his proper name we may easily find a reason why men have never attempt to give name to each sheep in their flock or crow that fly over their head much less to call every leaf of plant or grain of sand that come in their way by a peculiar name and would be useless if it be possible secondly if it be possible it would yet be useless because it would not serve to the chief end of language men would in vain heap up name of particular things that would not serve them to communicate their thoughts men learn name and use them in talk with others only that they may be understand which be then only do when by use or consent the sound i make by the organs of speech excite in another man mind who hear it the idea i apply it to in mine when i speak it this can not be do by name apply to particular things whereof i alone have the ideas in my mind the name of them could not be significant or intelligible to another who be not acquaint with all those very particular things which have fall under my notice a distinct name for every particular thing not fit for enlargement of knowledge thirdly but yet grant this also feasible which i think be not yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge which though found in particular things enlarge itself by general view to which things reduce into sort under general name be properly subservient these with the name belong to them come within some compass and do not multiply every moment beyond what either the mind can contain or use require and therefore in these men have for the most part stop but yet not so as to hinder themselves from distinguish particular things by appropriate name where convenience demand it and therefore in their own species which they have most to do with and wherein they have often occasion to mention particular persons they make use of proper name and there distinct individuals have distinct denominations what things have proper name and why besides persons countries also cities rivers mountains and other the like distinctions of place have usually find peculiar name and that for the same reason they be such as men have often an occasion to mark particularly and as it be set before others in their discourse with them and i doubt not but if we have reason to mention particular horse as often as we have to mention particular men we should have proper name for the one as familiar as for the other and bucephalus would be a word as much in use as alexander and therefore we see that amongst jockey horse have their proper name to be know and distinguish by as commonly as their servants because amongst them there be often occasion to mention this or that particular horse when he be out of sight how general word be make the next thing to be consider ishow general word come to be make for since all things that exist be only particulars how come we by general term or where find we those general natures they be suppose to stand for word become general by be make the sign of general ideas and ideas become general by separate from them the circumstances of time and place and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence by this way of abstraction they be make capable of represent more individuals than one each of which have in it a conformity to that abstract idea be as we call it of that sort show by the way we enlarge our complex ideas from infancy but to deduce this a little more distinctly it will not perhaps be amiss to trace our notions and name from their begin and observe by what degrees we proceed and by what step we enlarge our ideas from our first infancy there be nothing more evident than that the ideas of the persons children converse with to instance in them alone be like the persons themselves only particular the ideas of the nurse and the mother be well frame in their mind and like picture of them there represent only those individuals the name they first give to them be confine to these individuals and the name of nurse and mamma the child use determine themselves to those persons afterwards when time and a larger acquaintance have make them observe that there be a great many other things in the world that in some common agreements of shape and several other qualities resemble their father and mother and those persons they have be use to they frame an idea which they find those many particulars do partake in and to that they give with others the name man for example and thus they come to have a general name and a general idea wherein they make nothing new but only leave out of the complex idea they have of peter and jam mary and jane that which be peculiar to each and retain only what be common to them all and further enlarge our complex ideas by still leave out properties contain in them by the same way that they come by the general name and idea of man they easily advance to more general name and notions for observe that several things that differ from their idea of man and can not therefore be comprehend under that name have yet certain qualities wherein they agree with man by retain only those qualities and unite them into one idea they have again another and more general idea to which have give a name they make a term of a more comprehensive extension which new idea be make not by any new addition but only as before by leave out the shape and some other properties signify by the name man and retain only a body with life sense and spontaneous motion comprehend under the name animal general natures be nothing but abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones that this be the way whereby men first form general ideas and general name to them i think be so evident that there need no other proof of it but the consider of a man self or others and the ordinary proceed of their mind in knowledge and he that think general natures or notions be anything else but such abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones take at first from particular existences will i fear be at a loss where to find them for let any one effect and then tell me wherein do his idea of man differ from that of peter and paul or his idea of horse from that of bucephalus but in the leave out something that be peculiar to each individual and retain so much of those particular complex ideas of several particular existences as they be find to agree in of the complex ideas signify by the name man and horse leave out but those particulars wherein they differ and retain only those wherein they agree and of those make a new distinct complex idea and give the name animal to it one have a more general term that comprehend with man several other creatures leave out of the idea of animal sense and spontaneous motion and the remain complex idea make up of the remain simple ones of body life and nourishment become a more general one under the more comprehensive term vivens and not to dwell longer upon this particular so evident in itself by the same way the mind proceed to body substance and at last to be thing and such universal term which stand for any of our ideas whatsoever to conclude this whole mystery of genera and species which make such a noise in the school and be with justice so little regard out of them be nothing else but abstract ideas more or less comprehensive with name annex to them in all which this be constant and unvariable that every more general term stand for such an idea and be but a part of any of those contain under it why the genus be ordinarily make use of in definitions this may show us the reason why in the define of word which be nothing but declare their signification we make use of the genus or next general word that comprehend it which be not out of necessity but only to save the labour of enumerate the several simple ideas which the next general word or genus stand for or perhaps sometimes the shame of not be able to do it but though define by genus and differentia i crave leave to use these term of art though originally latin since they most properly suit those notions they be apply to i say though define by the genus be the shortest way yet i think it may be doubt whether it be the best this i be sure it be not the only and so not absolutely necessary for definition be nothing but make another understand by word what idea the term define stand for a definition be best make by enumerate those simple ideas that be combine in the signification of the term define and if instead of such an enumeration men have accustom themselves to use the next general term it have not be out of necessity or for greater clearness but for quickness and dispatch sake for i think that to one who desire to know what idea the word man stand for if it should be say that man be a solid extend substance have life sense spontaneous motion and the faculty of reason i doubt not but the mean of the term man would be as well understand and the idea it stand for be at least as clearly make know as when it be define to be a rational animal which by the several definitions of animal vivens and corpus resolve itself into those enumerate ideas i have in explain the term man follow here the ordinary definition of the school which though perhaps not the most exact yet serve well enough to my present purpose and one may in this instance see what give occasion to the rule that a definition must consist of genus and differentia and it suffice to show us the little necessity there be of such a rule or advantage in the strict observe of it for definitions as have be say be only the explain of one word by several others so that the mean or idea it stand for may be certainly know languages be not always so make accord to the rule of logic that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly express by two others experience sufficiently satisfy us to the contrary or else those who have make this rule have do ill that they have give us so few definitions conformable to it but of definitions more in the next chapter general and universal be creatures of the understand and belong not to the real existence of things to return to general word it be plain by what have be say that general and universal belong not to the real existence of things but be the inventions and creatures of the understand make by it for its own use and concern only sign whether word or ideas word be general as have be say when use for sign of general ideas and so be applicable indifferently to many particular things and ideas be general when they be set up as the representatives of many particular things but universality belong not to things themselves which be all of them particular in their existence even those word and ideas which in their signification be general when therefore we quit particulars the general that rest be only creatures of our own make their general nature be nothing but the capacity they be put into by the understand of signify or represent many particulars for the signification they have be nothing but a relation that by the mind of man be add to them abstract ideas be the essences of genera and species the next thing therefore to be consider be what kind of signification it be that general word have for as it be evident that they do not signify barely one particular thing for then they would not be general term but proper name so on the other side it be as evident they do not signify a plurality for man and men would then signify the same and the distinction of number as the grammarians call them would be superfluous and useless that then which general word signify be a sort of things and each of them do that by be a sign of an abstract idea in the mind to which idea as things exist be find to agree so they come to be rank under that name or which be all one be of that sort whereby it be evident that the essences of the sort or if the latin word please better species of things be nothing else but these abstract ideas for the have the essence of any species be that which make anything to be of that species and the conformity to the idea to which the name be annex be that which give a right to that name the have the essence and the have that conformity must need be the same thing since to be of any species and to have a right to the name of that species be all one as for example to be a man or of the species man and to have right to the name man be the same thing again to be a man or of the species man and have the essence of a man be the same thing now since nothing can be a man or have a right to the name man but what have a conformity to the abstract idea the name man stand for nor anything be a man or have a right to the species man but what have the essence of that species it follow that the abstract idea for which the name stand and the essence of the species be one and the same from whence it be easy to observe that the essences of the sort of things and consequently the sort of things be the workmanship of the understand that abstract and make those general ideas they be the workmanship of the understand but have their foundation in the similitude of things i would not here be think to forget much less to deny that nature in the production of things make several of them alike there be nothing more obvious especially in the race of animals and all things propagate by seed but yet i think we may say the sort of them under name be the workmanship of the understand take occasion from the similitude it observe amongst them to make abstract general ideas and set them up in the mind with name annex to them as pattern or form for in that sense the word form have a very proper signification to which as particular things exist be find to agree so they come to be of that species have that denomination or be put into that classis for when we say this be a man that a horse this justice that cruelty this a watch that a jack what do we else but rank things under different specific name as agree to those abstract ideas of which we have make those name the sign and what be the essences of those species set out and mark by name but those abstract ideas in the mind which be as it be the bond between particular things that exist and the name they be to be rank under and when general name have any connexion with particular be these abstract ideas be the medium that unite them so that the essences of species as distinguish and denominate by us neither be nor can be anything but those precise abstract ideas we have in our mind and therefore the suppose real essences of substances if different from our abstract ideas can not be the essences of the species we rank things into for two species may be one as rationally as two different essences be the essence of one species and i demand what be the alterations which may or may not be make in a horse or lead without make either of them to be of another species in determine the species of things by our abstract ideas this be easy to resolve but if any one will regulate himself herein by suppose real essences he will i suppose be at a loss and he will never be able to know when anything precisely cease to be of the species of a horse or lead each distinct abstract idea be a distinct essence nor will any one wonder that i say these essences or abstract ideas which be the measure of name and the boundaries of species be the workmanship of the un derstanding who consider that at least the complex ones be often in several men different collections of simple ideas and therefore that be covetousness to one man which be not so to another nay even in substances where their abstract ideas seem to be take from the things themselves they be not constantly the same no not in that species which be most familiar to us and with which we have the most intimate acquaintance it have be more than once doubt whether the foetus bear of a woman be a man even so far as that it hath be debate whether it be or be not to be nourish and baptize which could not be if the abstract idea or essence to which the name man belong be of natures make and be not the uncertain and various collection of simple ideas which the understand put together and then abstract it affix a name to it so that in truth every distinct abstract idea be a distinct essence and the name that stand for such distinct ideas be the name of things essentially different thus a circle be as essentially different from an oval as a sheep from a goat and rain be as essentially different from snow as water from earth that abstract idea which be the essence of one be impossible to be communicate to the other and thus any two abstract ideas that in any part vary one from another with two distinct name annex to them constitute two distinct sort or if you please species as essentially different as any two of the most remote or opposite in the world several significations of the word essence but since the essences of things be think by some and not without reason to be wholly unknown it may not be amiss to consider the several significations of the word essence real essences first essence may be take for the very be of anything whereby it be what it be and thus the real internal but generally in substances unknown constitution of things whereon their discoverable qualities depend may be call their essence this be the proper original signification of the word as be evident from the formation of it essentia in its primary notation signify properly be and in this sense it be still use when we speak of the essence of particular things without give them any name nominal essences secondly the learn and dispute of the school have be much busy about genus and species the word essence have almost lose its primary signification and instead of the real constitution of things have be almost wholly apply to the artificial constitution of genus and species it be true there be ordinarily suppose a real constitution of the sort of things and it be past doubt there must be some real constitution on which any collection of simple ideas coexist must depend but it be evident that things be rank under name into sort or species only as they agree to certain abstract ideas to which we have annex those name the essence of each genus or sort come to be nothing but that abstract idea which the general or sortal if i may have leave so to call it from sort as i do general from genus name stand for and this we shall find to be that which the word essence import in its most familiar use these two sort of essences i suppose may not unfitly be term the one the real the other nominal essence constant connexion between the name and nominal essence between the nominal essence and the name there be so near a connexion that the name of any sort of things can not be attribute to any particular be but what have this essence whereby it answer that abstract idea whereof that name be the sign supposition that species be distinguish by their real essences useless concern the real essences of corporeal substances to mention these only there be if i mistake not two opinions the one be of those who use the word essence for they know not what suppose a certain number of those essences accord to which all natural things be make and wherein they do exactly every one of them partake and so become of this or that species the other and more rational opinion be of those who look on all natural things to have a real but unknown constitution of their insensible part from which flow those sensible qualities which serve us to distinguish them one from another accord as we have occasion to rank them into sort under common denominations the former of these opinions which suppose these essences as a certain number of form or mould wherein all natural things that exist be cast and do equally partake have i imagine very much perplex the knowledge of natural things the frequent productions of monsters in all the species of animals and of changelings and other strange issue of human birth carry with them difficulties not possible to consist with this hypothesis since it be as impossible that two things partake exactly of the same real essence should have different properties as that two figure partake of the same real essence of a circle should have different properties but be there no other reason against it yet the supposition of essences that can not be know and the make of them nevertheless to be that which distinguish the species of things be so wholly useless and unserviceable to any part of our knowledge that that alone be sufficient to make us lay it by and content ourselves with such essences of the sort or species of things as come within the reach of our knowledge which when seriously consider will be find as i have say to be nothing else but those abstract complex ideas to which we have annex distinct general name real and nominal essence the same in simple ideas and modes different in substances essences be thus distinguish into nominal and real we may further observe that in the species of simple ideas and modes they be always the same but in substances always quite different thus a figure include a space between three line be the real as well as nominal essence of a triangle it be not only the abstract idea to which the general name be annex but the very essentia or be of the thing itself that foundation from which all its properties flow and to which they be all inseparably annex but it be far otherwise concern that parcel of matter which make the ring on my finger wherein these two essences be apparently different for it be the real constitution of its insensible part on which depend all those properties of colour weight fusibility fixedness c which be to be find in it which constitution we know not and so have no particular idea of have no name that be the sign of it but yet it be its colour weight fusibility fixedness c which make it to be gold or give it a right to that name which be therefore its nominal essence since nothing can be call gold but what have a conformity of qualities to that abstract complex idea to which that name be annex but this distinction of essences belong particularly to substances we shall when we come to consider their name have an occasion to treat of more fully essences ingenerable and incorruptible that such abstract ideas with name to them as we have be speak of be essences may further appear by what we be tell concern essences viz that they be all ingenerable and incorruptible which can not be true of the real constitutions of things which begin and perish with them all things that exist besides their author be all liable to change especially those things we be acquaint with and have rank into band under distinct name or ensigns thus that which be grass today be tomorrow the flesh of a sheep and within a few days after become part of a man in all which and the like change it be evident their real essenceie that constitution whereon the properties of these several things dependedis destroy and perish with them but essences be take for ideas establish in the mind with name annex to them they be suppose to remain steadily the same whatever mutations the particular substances be liable to for whatever become of alexander and bucephalus the ideas to which man and horse be annex be suppose nevertheless to remain the same and so the essences of those species be preserve whole and undestroyed whatever change happen to any or all of the individuals of those species by this mean the essence of a species rest safe and entire without the existence of so much as one individual of that kind for be there now no circle exist anywhere in the world as perhaps that figure exist not anywhere exactly mark out yet the idea annex to that name would not cease to be what it be nor cease to be as a pattern to determine which of the particular figure we meet with have or have not a right to the name circle and so to show which of them by have that essence be of that species and though there neither be nor have be in nature such a beast as an unicorn or such a fish as a mermaid yet suppose those name to stand for complex abstract ideas that contain no inconsistency in them the essence of a mermaid be as intelligible as that of a man and the idea of an unicorn as certain steady and permanent as that of a horse from what have be say it be evident that the doctrine of the immutability of essences prove them to be only abstract ideas and be found on the relation establish between them and certain sound as sign of them and will always be true as long as the same name can have the same signification recapitulation to conclude this be that which in short i would say viz that all the great business of genera and species and their essences amount to no more but thisthat men make abstract ideas and settle them in their mind with name annex to them do thereby enable themselves to consider things and discourse of them as it be in bundle for the easier and readier improvement and communication of their knowledge which would advance but slowly be their word and thoughts confine only to particulars of the name of simple ideas name of simple ideas modes and substances have each something peculiar though all word as i have show signify nothing immediately but the ideas in the mind of the speaker yet upon a nearer survey we shall find the name of simple ideas mix modes under which i comprise relations too and natural substances have each of them something peculiar and different from the other for example name of simple ideas and of substances intimate real existence first the name of simple ideas and substances with the abstract ideas in the mind which they immediately signify intimate also some real existence from which be derive their original pattern but the name of mix modes terminate in the idea that be in the mind and lead not the thoughts any further as we shall see more at large in the follow chapter name of simple ideas and modes signify always both real and nominal essences secondly the name of simple ideas and modes signify always the real as well as nominal essence of their species but the name of natural substances signify rarely if ever anything but barely the nominal essences of those species as we shall show in the chapter that treat of the name of substances in particular name of simple ideas be undefinable thirdly the name of simple ideas be not capable of any definition the name of all complex ideas be it have not that i know be yet observe by anybody what word be and what be not capable of be define the want whereof be as i be apt to think not seldom the occasion of great wrangle and obscurity in mens discourse whilst some demand definitions of term that can not be define and others think they ought not to rest satisfy in an explication make by a more general word and its restriction or to speak in term of art by a genus and difference when even after such definition make accord to rule those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the mean of the word than they have before this at least i think that the show what word be and what be not capable of definitions and wherein consist a good definition be not wholly besides our present purpose and perhaps will afford so much light to the nature of these sign and our ideas as to deserve a more particular consideration if all name be definable it would be a process in infinitum i will not here trouble myself to prove that all term be not definable from that progress in infinitum which it will visibly lead us into if we should allow that all name could be define for if the term of one definition be still to be define by another where at last should we stop but i shall from the nature of our ideas and the signification of our word show why some name can and others can not be define and which they be what a definition be i think it be agree that a definition be nothing else but the show the mean of one word by several other not synonymous term the mean of word be only the ideas they be make to stand for by him that use them the mean of any term be then show or the word be define when by other word the idea it be make the sign of and annex to in the mind of the speaker be as it be represent or set before the view of another and thus its signification be ascertain this be the only use and end of definitions and therefore the only measure of what be or be not a good definition simple ideas why undefinable this be premise i say that the name of simple ideas and those only be incapable of be define the reason whereof be this that the several term of a definition signify several ideas they can all together by no mean represent an idea which have no composition at all and therefore a definition which be properly nothing but the show the mean of one word by several others not signify each the same thing can in the name of simple ideas have no place instance scholastic definitions of motion the not observe this difference in our ideas and their name have produce that eminent trifle in the school which be so easy to be observe in the definitions they give us of some few of these simple ideas for as to the greatest part of them even those master of definitions be fain to leave them untouched merely by the impossibility they find in it what more exquisite jargon could the wit of man invent than this definitionthe act of a be in power as far forth as in power which would puzzle any rational man to whom it be not already know by its famous absurdity to guess what word it could ever be suppose to be the explication of if tully ask a dutchman what beweeginge be should have receive this explication in his own language that it be actus entis in potentia quatenus in potentia i ask whether any one can imagine he could thereby have understand what the word beweeginge signify or have guess what idea a dutchman ordinarily have in his mind and would signify to another when he use that sound modern definitions of motion nor have the modern philosophers who have endeavour to throw off the jargon of the school and speak intelligibly much bet ter succeed in define simple ideas whether by explain their cause or any otherwise the atomists who define motion to be a passage from one place to another what do they more than put one synonymous word for another for what be passage other than motion and if they be ask what passage be how would they better define it than by motion for be it not at least as proper and significant to say passage be a motion from one place to another as to say motion be a passage c this be to translate and not to define when we change two word of the same signification one for another which when one be better understand than the other may serve to discover what idea the unknown stand for but be very far from a definition unless we will say every english word in the dictionary be the definition of the latin word it answer and that motion be a definition of motus nor will the successive application of the part of the superficies of one body to those of another which the cartesians give us prove a much better definition of motion when well examine definitions of light the act of perspicuous as far forth as perspicuous be another peripatetic definition of a simple idea which though not more absurd than the former of motion yet betray its uselessness and insignificancy more plainly because experience will easily convince any one that it can not make the mean of the word light which it pretend to define at all understand by a blind man but the definition of motion appear not at first sight so useless because it escape this way of trial for this simple idea enter by the touch as well as sight it be impossible to show an example of any one who have no other way to get the idea of motion but barely by the definition of that name those who tell us that light be a great number of little globules strike briskly on the bottom of the eye speak more intelligibly than the school but yet these word never so well understand would make the idea the word light stand for no more know to a man that understand it not before than if one should tell him that light be nothing but a company of little tennisballs which fairies all day long strike with racket against some mens foreheads whilst they pass by others for grant this explication of the thing to be true yet the idea of the cause of light if we have it never so exact would no more give us the idea of light itself as it be such a particular perception in us than the idea of the figure and motion of a sharp piece of steel would give us the idea of that pain which it be able to cause in us for the cause of any sensation and the sensation itself in all the simple ideas of one sense be two ideas and two ideas so different and distant one from another that no two can be more so and therefore should descartess globules strike never so long on the retina of a man who be blind by a gutta serena he would thereby never have any idea of light or anything approach it though he understand never so well what little globules be and what strike on another body be and therefore the cartesians very well distinguish between that light which be the cause of that sensation in us and the idea which be produce in us by it and be that which be properly light simple ideas why undefinable further explain simple ideas as have be show be only to be get by those impressions object themselves make on our mind by the proper inlets appoint to each sort if they be not receive this way all the word in the world make use of to explain or define any of their name will never be able to produce in us the idea it stand for for word be sound can produce in us no other simple ideas than of those very sound nor excite any in us but by that voluntary connexion which be know to be between them and those simple ideas which common use have make them the sign of he that think otherwise let him try if any word can give him the taste of a pineapple and make him have the true idea of the relish of that celebrate delicious fruit so far as he be tell it have a resemblance with any taste whereof he have the ideas already in his memory imprint there by sensible object not strangers to his palate so far may he approach that resemblance in his mind but this be not give us that idea by a definition but excite in us other simple ideas by their know name which will be still very different from the true taste of that fruit itself in light and colour and all other simple ideas it be the same thing for the signification of sound be not natural but only impose and arbitrary and no definition of light or redness be more fit or able to produce either of those ideas in us than the sound light or red by itself for to hope to produce an idea of light or colour by a sound however form be to expect that sound should be visible or colour audible and to make the ears do the office of all the other sense which be all one as to say that we might taste smell and see by the ears a sort of philosophy worthy only of sancho panza who have the faculty to see dulcinea by hearsay and therefore he that have not before receive into his mind by the proper inlet the simple idea which any word stand for can never come to know the signification of that word by any other word or sound whatsoever put together accord to any rule of definition the only way be by apply to his sense the proper object and so produce that idea in him for which he have learn the name already a studious blind man who have mightily beat his head about visible object and make use of the explication of his book and friends to understand those name of light and colour which often come in his way brag one day that he now understand what scarlet signify upon which his friend demand what scarlet be the blind man answer it be like the sound of a trumpet just such an understand of the name of any other simple idea will he have who hop to get it only from a definition or other word make use of to explain it the contrary show in complex ideas by instance of a statue and rainbow the case be quite otherwise in complex ideas which consist of several simple ones it be in the power of word stand for the several ideas that make that composition to imprint complex ideas in the mind which be never there before and so make their name be understand in such collections of ideas pass under one name definition or the teach the signification of one word by several others have place and may make us understand the name of things which never come within the reach of our sense and frame ideas suitable to those in other mens mind when they use those name provide that none of the term of the definition stand for any such simple ideas which he to whom the explication be make have never yet have in his think thus the word statue may be explain to a blind man by other word when picture can not his sense have give him the idea of figure but not of colour which therefore word can not excite in him this gain the prize to the painter against the statuary each of which contend for the excellency of his art and the statuary brag that his be to be prefer because it reach further and even those who have lose their eye could yet perceive the excellency of it the painter agree to refer himself to the judgment of a blind man who be bring where there be a statue make by the one and a picture draw by the other he be first lead to the statue in which he trace with his hand all the lineaments of the face and body and with great admiration applaud the skill of the workman but be lead to the picture and have his hand lay upon it be tell that now he touch the head and then the forehead eye nose c as his hand move over the part of the picture on the cloth without find any the least distinction whereupon he cry out that certainly that must need be a very admirable and divine piece of workmanship which could represent to them all those part where he could neither feel nor perceive anything colour indefinable to the bornblind he that should use the word rainbow to one who know all those colour but yet have never see that phenomenon would by enumerate the figure largeness position and order of the colour so well define that word that it might be perfectly understand but yet that definition how exact and perfect soever would never make a blind man understand it because several of the simple ideas that make that complex one be such as he never receive by sensation and experience no word be able to excite them in his mind complex ideas definable only when the simple ideas of which they consist have be get from experience simple ideas as have be show can only be get by experience from those object which be proper to produce in us those perceptions when by this mean we have our mind store with them and know the name for them then we be in a condition to define and by definition to understand the name of complex ideas that be make up of them but when any term stand for a simple idea that a man have never yet have in his mind it be impossible by any word to make know its mean to him when any term stand for an idea a man be acquaint with but be ignorant that that term be the sign of it then another name of the same idea which he have be accustom to may make him understand its mean but in no case whatsoever be any name of any simple idea capable of a definition name of simple ideas of less doubtful mean than those of mix modes and substances fourthly but though the name of simple ideas have not the help of definition to determine their signification yet that hinder not but that they be generally less doubtful and uncertain than those of mix modes and substances because they stand only for one simple perception men for the most part easily and perfectly agree in their signification and there be little room for mistake and wrangle about their mean he that know once that whiten be the name of that colour he have observe in snow or milk will not be apt to misapply that word as long as he retain that idea which when he have quite lose he be not apt to mistake the mean of it but perceive he understand it not there be neither a multiplicity of simple ideas to be put together which make the doubtfulness in the name of mix modes nor a suppose but an unknown real essence with properties depend thereon the precise number whereof be also unknown which make the difficulty in the name of substances but on the contrary in simple ideas the whole signification of the name be know at once and consist not of part whereof more or less be put in the idea may be vary and so the signification of name be obscure or uncertain simple ideas have few ascents in linea praedicamentali fifthly this further may be observe concern simple ideas and their name that they have but few ascents in linea praedicamentali as they call it from the lowest species to the summum genus the reason whereof be that the lowest species be but one simple idea nothing can be leave out of it that so the difference be take away it may agree with some other thing in one idea common to them both which have one name be the genus of the other two vg there be nothing that can be leave out of the idea of white and red to make them agree in one common appearance and so have one general name as rationality be leave out of the complex idea of man make it agree with brute in the more general idea and name of animal and therefore when to avoid unpleasant enumerations men would comprehend both white and red and several other such simple ideas under one general name they have be fain to do it by a word which denote only the way they get into the mind for when white red and yellow be all comprehend under the genus or name colour it signify no more but such ideas as be produce in the mind only by the sight and have entrance only through the eye and when they would frame yet a more general term to comprehend both colour and sound and the like simple ideas they do it by a word that signify all such as come into the mind only by one sense and so the general term quality in its ordinary acceptation comprehend colour sound taste smell and tangible qualities with distinction from extension number motion pleasure and pain which make impressions on the mind and introduce their ideas by more sense than one name of simple ideas not arbitrary but perfectly take from the existence of things sixthly the name of simple ideas substances and mix modes have also this difference that those of mix modes stand for ideas perfectly arbitrary those of substances be not perfectly so but refer to a pattern though with some latitude and those of simple ideas be perfectly take from the existence of things and be not arbitrary at an which what difference it make in the significations of their name we shall see in the follow chapters simple modes the name of simple modes differ little from those of simple ideas of the name of mix modes and relations mix modes stand for abstract ideas as other general name the name of mix modes be general they stand as have be shew for sort or species of things each of which have its peculiar essence the essences of these species also as have be shew be nothing but the abstract ideas in the mind to which the name be annex thus far the name and essences of mix modes have nothing but what be common to them with other ideas but if we take a little nearer survey of them we shall find that they have something peculiar which perhaps may deserve our attention first the abstract ideas they stand for be make by the understand the first particularity i shall observe in them be that the abstract ideas or if you please the essences of the several species of mix modes be make by the understand wherein they differ from those of simple ideas in which sort the mind have no power to make any one but only receive such as be present to it by the real existence of things operate upon it secondly make arbitrarily and without pattern in the next place these essences of the species of mix modes be not only make by the mind but make very arbitrarily make without pattern or reference to any real existence wherein they differ from those of substances which carry with them the supposition of some real be from which they be take and to which they be comformable but in its complex ideas of mix modes the mind take a liberty not to follow the existence of things exactly it unite and retain certain collections as so many distinct specific ideas whilst others that as often occur in nature and be as plainly suggest by outward things pass neglect without particular name or specifications nor do the mind in these of mix modes as in the complex idea of substances examine them by the real existence of things or verify them by pattern contain such peculiar compositions in nature to know whether his idea of adultery or incest be right will a man seek it anywhere amongst things exist or be it true because any one have be witness to such an action no but it suffice here that men have put together such a collection into one complex idea that make the archetype and specific idea whether ever any such action be commit in rerum natura or no how this be do to understand this right we must consider wherein this make of these complex ideas consist and that be not in the make any new idea but put together those which the mind have before wherein the mind do these three things first it choose a certain number secondly it give them connexion and make them into one idea thirdly it tie them together by a name if we examine how the mind proceed in these and what liberty it take in them we shall easily observe how these essences of the species of mix modes be the workmanship of the mind and consequently that the species themselves be of mens make evidently arbitrary in that the idea be often before the existence nobody can doubt but that these ideas of mix modes be make by a voluntary collection of ideas put together in the mind independent from any original pattern in nature who will but reflect that this sort of complex ideas may be make abstract and have name give them and so a species be constitute before any one individual of that species ever exist who can doubt but the ideas of sacrilege or adultery might be frame in the mind of men and have name give them and so these species of mix modes be constitute before either of them be ever commit and might be as well discourse of and reason about and as certain truths discover of them whilst yet they have no be but in the understand as well as now that they have but too frequently a real existence whereby it be plain how much the sort of mix modes be the creatures of the understand where they have a be as subservient to all the end of real truth and knowledge as when they really exist and we can not doubt but lawmakers have often make laws about species of action which be only the creatures of their own understand be that have no other existence but in their own mind and i think nobody can deny but that the resurrection be a species of mix modes in the mind before it really exist instance murder incest stab to see how arbitrarily these essences of mix modes be make by the mind we need but take a view of almost any of them a little look into them will satisfy us that it be the mind that combine several scatter independent ideas into one complex one and by the common name it give them make them the essence of a certain species without regulate itself by any connexion they have in nature for what greater connexion in nature have the idea of a man than the idea of a sheep with kill that this be make a particular species of action signify by the word murder and the other not or what union be there in nature between the idea of the relation of a father with kill than that of a son or neighbour that those be combine into one complex idea and thereby make the essence of the distinct species parricide whilst the other make no distinct species at all but though they have make kill a man father or mother a distinct species from kill his son or daughter yet in some other case son and daughter be take in too as well as father and mother and they be all equally comprehend in the same species as in that of incest thus the mind in mix modes arbitrarily unite into complex ideas such as it find convenient whilst others that have altogether as much union in nature be leave loose and never combine into one idea because they have no need of one name it be evident then that the mind by its free choice give a connexion to a certain number of ideas which in nature have no more union with one another than others that it leave out why else be the part of the weapon the begin of the wind be make with take notice of to make the distinct species call stab and the figure and matter of the weapon leave out i do not say this be do without reason as we shall see more by and by but this i say that it be do by the free choice of the mind pursue its own end and that therefore these species of mix modes be the workmanship of the understand and there be nothing more evident than that for the most part in the frame of these ideas the mind search not its pattern in nature nor refer the ideas it make to the real existence of things but put such together as may best serve its own purpose without tie itself to a precise imitation of anything that really exist but still subservient to the end of language and not make at random but though these complex ideas or essences of mix modes depend on the mind and be make by it with great liberty yet they be not make at random and jumble together without any reason at all though these complex ideas be not always copy from nature yet they be always suit to the end for which abstract ideas be make and though they be combinations make of ideas that be loose enough and have as little union in themselves as several others to which the mind never give a connexion that combine them into one idea yet they be always make for the convenience of communication which be the chief end of language the use of language be by short sound to signify with ease and dispatch general conceptions wherein not only abundance of particulars may be contain but also a great variety of independent ideas collect into one complex one in the make therefore of the species of mix modes men have have regard only to such combinations as they have occasion to mention one to another those they have combine into distinct complex ideas and give name to whilst others that in nature have as near a union be leave loose and unregarded for to go no further than human action themselves if they would make distinct abstract ideas of all the varieties which might be observe in them the number must be infinite and the memory confound with the plenty as well as overcharge to little purpose it suffice that men make and name so many complex ideas of these mix modes as they find they have occasion to have name for in the ordinary occurrence of their affairs if they join to the idea of kill the idea of father or mother and so make a distinct species from kill a man son or neighbour it be because of the different heinousness of the crime and the distinct punishment be due to the murder a man father and mother different to what ought to be inflict on the murderer of a son or neighbour and therefore they find it necessary to mention it by a distinct name which be the end of make that distinct combination but though the ideas of mother and daughter be so differently treat in reference to the idea of kill that the one be join with it to make a distinct abstract idea with a name and so a distinct species and the other not yet in respect of carnal knowledge they be both take in under incest and that still for the same convenience of express under one name and reckon of one species such unclean mixtures as have a peculiar turpitude beyond others and this to avoid circumlocutions and tedious descriptions whereof the intranslatable word of divers languages be a proof a moderate skill in different languages will easily satisfy one of the truth of this it be so obvious to observe great store of word in one language which have not any that answer them in another which plainly show that those of one country by their customs and manner of life have find occasion to make several complex ideas and give name to them which others never collect into specific ideas this could not have happen if these species be the steady workmanship of nature and not collections make and abstract by the mind in order to name and for the convenience of communication the term of our law which be not empty sound will hardly find word that answer them in the spanish or italian no scanty languages much less i think could any one translate them into the caribbee or westoe tongue and the versura of the romans or corban of the jews have no word in other languages to answer them the reason whereof be plain from what have be say nay if we look a little more nearly into this matter and exactly compare different languages we shall find that though they have word which in translations and dictionaries be suppose to answer one another yet there be scarce one of ten amongst the name of complex ideas especially of mix modes that stand for the same precise idea which the word do that in dictionaries it be render by there be no ideas more common and less compound than the measure of time extension and weight and the latin name hora pes libra be without difficulty render by the english name hour foot and pound but yet there be nothing more evident than that the ideas a roman annex to these latin name be very far different from those which an englishman express by those english ones and if either of these should make use of the measure that those of the other language design by their name he would be quite out in his account these be too sensible proof to be doubt and we shall find this much more so in the name of more abstract and compound ideas such as be the greatest part of those which make up moral discourse whose name when men come curiously to compare with those they be translate into in other languages they will find very few of them exactly to correspond in the whole extent of their significations this show species to be make for communication the reason why i take so particular notice of this be that we may not be mistake about genera and species and their essences as if they be things regularly and constantly make by nature and have a real existence in things when they appear upon a more wary survey to be nothing else but an artifice of the understand for the easier signify such collections of ideas as it should often have occasion to communicate by one general term under which divers particulars as far forth as they agree to that abstract idea might be comprehend and if the doubtful signification of the word species may make it sound harsh to some that i say the species of mix modes be make by the understand yet i think it can by nobody be deny that it be the mind make those abstract complex ideas to which specific name be give and if it be true as it be that the mind make the pattern for sort and name of things i leave it to be consider who make the boundaries of the sort or species since with me species and sort have no other difference than that of a latin and english idiom in mix modes it be the name that tie the combination of simple ideas together and make it a species the near relation that there be between species essences and their general name at least in mix modes will further appear when we consider that it be the name that seem to preserve those essences and give them their last duration for the connexion between the loose part of those complex ideas be make by the mind this union which have no particular foundation in nature would cease again be there not something that do as it be hold it together and keep the part from scatter though therefore it be the mind that make the collection it be the name which be as it be the knot that tie them fast together what a vast variety of different ideas do the word triumphus hold together and deliver to us as one species have this name be never make or quite lose we might no doubt have have descriptions of what pass in that solemnity but yet i think that which hold those different part together in the unity of one complex idea be that very word annex to it without which the several part of that would no more be think to make one thing than any other show which have never be make but once have never be unite into one complex idea under one denomination how much therefore in mix modes the unity necessary to any essence depend on the mind and how much the continuation and fix of that unity depend on the name in common use annex to it i leave to be consider by those who look upon essences and species as real establish things in nature suitable to this we find that men speak of mix modes seldom imagine or take any other for species of them but such as be set out by name because they be of man make only in order to name no such species be take notice of or suppose to be unless a name be join to it as the sign of man have combine into one idea several loose ones and by that name give a last union to the part which would otherwise cease to have any as soon as the mind lay by that abstract idea and cease actually to think on it but when a name be once annex to it wherein the part of that complex idea have a settle and permanent union then be the essence as it be establish and the species look on as complete for to what purpose should the memory charge itself with such compositions unless it be by abstraction to make them gen eral and to what purpose make them general unless it be that they might have general name for the convenience of discourse and communication thus we see that kill a man with a sword or a hatchet be look on as no distinct species of action but if the point of the sword first enter the body it pass for a distinct species where it have a distinct name as in england in whose language it be call stab but in another country where it have not happen to be specify under a peculiar name it pass not for a distinct species but in the species of corporeal substances though it be the mind that make the nominal essence yet since those ideas which be combine in it be suppose to have an union in nature whether the mind join them or not therefore those be look on as distinct species without any operation of the mind either abstract or give a name to that complex idea for the originals of our mix modes we look no further than the mind which also show them to he the workmanship of the understand conformable also to what have be say concern the essences of the species of mix modes that they be the creatures of the understand rather than the work of nature conformable i say to this we find that their name lead our thoughts to the mind and no further when we speak of justice or gratitude we frame to ourselves no imagination of anything exist which we would conceive but our thoughts terminate in the abstract ideas of those virtues and look not further as they do when we speak of a horse or iron whose specific ideas we consider not as barely in the mind but as in things themselves which afford the original pattern of those ideas but in mix modes at least the most considerable part of them which be moral be we consider the original pattern as be in the mind and to those we refer for the distinguish of particular be under name and hence i think it be that these essences of the species of mix modes be by a more particular name call notions as by a peculiar right appertain to the understand their be make by the understand without pattern show the reason why they be so compound hence likewise we may learn why the complex ideas of mix modes be commonly more compound and decompounded than those of natural substances because they be the workmanship of the understand pursue only its own end and the conveniency of express in short those ideas it would make know to another it do with great liberty unite often into one abstract idea things that in their nature have no coherence and so under one term bundle together a great variety of compound and decompounded ideas thus the name of procession what a great mixture of independent ideas of persons habit taper order motion sound do it contain in that complex one which the mind of man have arbitrarily put together to express by that one name whereas the complex ideas of the sort of substances be usually make up of only a small number of simple ones and in the species of animals these two viz shape and voice commonly make the whole nominal essence name of mix modes stand always for their real essences which be the workmanship of our mind another thing we may observe from what have be say be that the name of mix modes always signify when they have any determine signification the real essences of their species for these abstract ideas be the workmanship of the mind and not refer to the real existence of things there be no supposition of anything more signify by that name but barely that complex idea the mind itself have form which be all it would have express by it and be that on which all the properties of the species depend and from which alone they all flow and so in these the real and nominal essence be the same which of what concernment it be to the certain knowledge of general truth we shall see hereafter why their name be usually get before their ideas this also may show us the reason why for the most part the name of fix modes be get before the ideas they stand for be perfectly know because there be no species of these ordinarily take notice of but what have name and those species or rather their essences be abstract complex ideas make arbitrarily by the mind it be convenient if not necessary to know the name before one endeavour to frame these complex ideas unless a man will fill his head with a company of abstract complex ideas which others have no name for he have nothing to do with but to lay by and forget again i confess that in the begin of languages it be necessary to have the idea before one give it the name and so it be still where make a new complex idea one also by give it a new name make a new word but this concern not languages make which have generally pretty well provide for ideas which men have frequent occasion to have and communicate and in such i ask whether it be not the ordinary method that children learn the name of mix modes before they have their ideas what one of a thousand ever frame the abstract ideas of glory and ambition before he have hear the name of them in simple ideas and substances i grant it be otherwise which be such ideas as have a real existence and union in nature the ideas and name be get one before the other as it happen reason of my be so large on this subject what have be say here of mix modes be with very little difference applicable also to relations which since every man himself may observe i may spare myself the pain to enlarge on especially since what i have here say concern word in this third book will possibly be think by some to be much more than what so slight a subject require i allow it might be bring into a narrower compass but i be will to stay my reader on an argument that appear to me new and a little out of the way i be sure it be one i think not of when i begin to write that by search it to the bottom and turn it on every side some part or other might meet with every ones thoughts and give occasion to the most averse or negligent to reflect on a general miscarriage which though of great consequence be little take notice of when it be consider what a pudder be make about essences and how much all sort of knowledge discourse and conversation be pester and disorder by the careless and confuse use and application of word it will perhaps be think worth while thoroughly to lay it open and i shall be pardon if i have dwell long on an argument which i think therefore need to be incul cat because the fault men be usually guilty of in this kind be not only the greatest hindrances of true knowledge but be so well think of as to pass for it men would often see what a small pittance of reason and truth or possibly none at all be mix with those huff opinions they be swell with if they would but look beyond fashionable sound and observe what ideas be or be not comprehend under those word with which they be so arm at all point and with which they so confidently lay about them i shall imagine i have do some service to truth peace and learn if by any enlargement on this subject i can make men reflect on their own use of language and give them reason to suspect that since it be frequent for others it may also be possible for them to have sometimes very good and approve word in their mouth and write with very uncertain little or no signification and therefore it be not unreasonable for them to be wary herein themselves and not to be unwilling to have them examine by others with this design therefore i shall go on with what i have further to say concern this matter i of the name of substances the common name of substances stand for sort the common name of substances as well as other general term stand for sort which be nothing else but the be make sign of such complex ideas wherein several particular substances do or might agree by virtue of which they be capable of be comprehend in one common conception and signify by one name i say do or might agree for though there be but one sun exist in the world yet the idea of it be abstract so that more substances if there be several might each agree in it it be as much a sort as if there be as many sun as there be star they want not their reason who think there be and that each fix star would answer the idea the name sun stand for to one who be place in a due distance which by the way may show us how much the sort or if you please genera and species of things for those latin term signify to me no more than the english word sort depend on such collections of ideas as men have make and not on the real nature of things since it be not impossible but that in propriety of speech that might be a sun to one which be a star to another the essence of each sort of substance be our abstract idea to which the name be annex the measure and boundary of each sort or species whereby it be constitute that particular sort and distinguish from others be that we call its essence which be nothing but that abstract idea to which the name be annex so that everything contain in that idea be essential to that sort this though it be all the essence of natural substances that we know or by which we distinguish them into sort yet i call it by a peculiar name the nominal essence to distinguish it from the real constitution of substances upon which depend this nominal essence and all the properties of that sort which therefore as have be say may be call the real essence vg the nominal essence of gold be that complex idea the word gold stand for let it be for instance a body yellow of a certain weight malleable fusible and fix but the real essence be the constitution of the insensible part of that body on which those qualities and all the other properties of gold depend how far these two be different though they be both call essence be obvious at first sight to discover the nominal and real essence different for though perhaps voluntary motion with sense and reason join to a body of a certain shape be the complex idea to which i and others annex the name man and so be the nominal essence of the species so call yet nobody will say that complex idea be the real essence and source of all those operations which be to be find in any individual of that sort the foundation of all those qualities which be the ingredients of our complex idea be something quite different and have we such a knowledge of that constitution of man from which his faculties of move sensation and reason and other power flow and on which his so regular shape depend as it be possible angels have and it be certain his maker have we should have a quite other idea of his essence than what now be contain in our definition of that species be it what it will and our idea of any individual man would be as far different from what it be now as be his who know all the spring and wheel and other contrivances within of the famous clock at strasburg from that which a gaze countryman have of it who barely see the motion of the hand and hear the clock strike and observe only some of the outward appearances nothing essential to individuals that essence in the ordinary use of the word relate to sort and that it be consider in particular be no further than as they be rank into sort appear from hence that take but away the abstract ideas by which we sort individuals and rank them under common name and then the think of anything essential to any of them instantly vanish we have no notion of the one without the other which plainly show their relation it be necessary for me to be as i be god and nature have make me so but there be nothing i have be essential to me an accident or disease may very much alter my colour or shape a fever or fall may take away my reason or memory or both and an apoplexy leave neither sense nor understand no nor life other creatures of my shape may be make with more and better or fewer and worse faculties than i have and others may have reason and sense in a shape and body very different from mine none of these be essential to the one or the other or to any individual whatever till the mind refer it to some sort or species of things and then presently accord to the abstract idea of that sort something be find essential let any one examine his own thoughts and he will find that as soon as he suppose or speak of essential the consideration of some species or the complex idea signify by some general name come into his mind and it be in reference to that that this or that quality be say to be essential so that if it be ask whether it be essential to me or any other particular corporeal be to have reason i say no no more than it be essential to this white thing i write on to have word in it but if that particular be be to be count of the sort man and to have the name man give it then reason be essential to it suppose reason to be a part of the complex idea the name man stand for as it be essential to this thing i write on to contain word if i will give it the name treatise and rank it under that species so that essential and not essential relate only to our abstract ideas and the name annex to them which amount to no more than this that whatever particular thing have not in it those qualities which be contain in the abstract idea which any general term stand for can not be rank under that species nor be call by that name since that abstract idea be the very essence of that species the only essences perceive by us in individual substances be those qualities which entitle them to receive their name thus if the idea of body with some people be bare extension or space then solidity be not essential to body if others make the idea to which they give the name body to be solidity and extension then solidity be essential to body that therefore and that alone be consider as essential which make a part of the complex idea the name of a sort stand for without which no particular thing can be reckon of that sort nor be entitle to that name should there be find a parcel of matter that have all the other qualities that be in iron but want obedience to the loadstone and would neither be draw by it nor receive direction from it would any one question whether it want anything essential it would be absurd to ask whether a thing really exist want anything essential to it or could it be demand whether this make an essential or specific difference or no since we have no other measure of essential or specific but our abstract ideas and to talk of specific differences in nature without reference to general ideas in name be to talk unintelligibly for i would ask any one what be sufficient to make an essential difference in nature between any two particular be without any regard have to some abstract idea which be look upon as the essence and standard of a species all such pattern and standards be quite lay aside particular be consider barely in themselves will be find to have all their qualities equally essential and everything in each individual will be essential to it or which be more nothing at all for though it may be reasonable to ask whether obey the mag net be es sential to iron yet i think it be very improper and insignificant to ask whether it be essential to the particular parcel of matter i cut my pen with without consider it under the name iron or as be of a certain species and if as have be say our abstract ideas which have name annex to them be the boundaries of species nothing can be essential but what be contain in those ideas even the real essences of individual substances imply potential sort it be true i have often mention a real essence distinct in substances from those abstract ideas of them which i call their nominal essence by this real essence i mean that real constitution of anything which be the foundation of all those properties that be combine in and be constantly find to coexist with the nominal essence that particular constitution which everything have within itself without any relation to anything without it but essence even in this sense relate to a sort and suppose a species for be that real constitution on which the properties depend it necessarily suppose a sort of things properties belong only to species and not to individuals vg suppose the nominal essence of gold to be a body of such a peculiar colour and weight with malleability and fusibility the real essence be that constitution of the part of matter on which these qualities and their union depend and be also the foundation of its solubility in aqua regia and other properties accompany that complex idea here be essences and properties but all upon supposition of a sort or general abstract idea which be consider as immutable but there be no individual parcel of matter to which any of these qualities be so annex as to be essential to it or inseparable from it that which be essential belong to it as a condition whereby it be of this or that sort but take away the consideration of its be rank under the name of some abstract idea and then there be nothing necessary to it nothing inseparable from it indeed as to the real essences of substances we only suppose their be without precisely know what they be but that which annex them still to the species be the nominal essence of which they be the suppose foundation and cause the nominal essence bound the species for us the next thing to be consider be by which of those essences it be that substances be determine into sort or species and that it be evident be by the nominal essence for it be that alone that the name which be the mark of the sort signify it be impossible therefore that anything should determine the sort of things which we rank under general name but that idea which that name be design as a mark for which be that as have be show which we call nominal essence why do we say this be a horse and that a mule this be an animal that an herb how come any particular thing to be of this or that sort but because it have that nominal essence or which be all one agree to that abstract idea that name be annex to and i desire any one but to reflect on his own thoughts when he hear or speak any of those or other name of substances to know what sort of essences they stand for the nature of species as form by us and that the species of things to us be nothing but the rank them under distinct name accord to the complex ideas in us and not accord to precise distinct real essences in them be plain from hencethat we find many of the individuals that be rank into one sort call by one common name and so receive as be of one species have yet qualities depend on their real constitutions as far different one from another as from others from which they be account to differ specifically this as it be easy to be observe by all who have to do with natural body so chemists especially be often by sad experience convince of it when they sometimes in vain seek for the same qualities in one parcel of sulphur antimony or vitriol which they have find in others for though they be body of the same species have the same nominal essence under the same name yet do they often upon severe ways of examination betray qualities so different one from another as to frustrate the expectation and labour of very wary chemists but if things be distinguish into species accord to their real essences it would be as impossible to find different properties in any two individual substances of the same species as it be to find different properties in two circle or two equilateral triangles that be properly the essence to us which determine every particular to this or that classis or which be the same thing to this or that general name and what can that be else but that abstract idea to which that name be annex and so have in truth a reference not so much to the be of particular things as to their general denominations not the real essence or texture of part which we know not nor indeed can we rank and sort things and consequently which be the end of sort denominate them by their real essences because we know them not our faculties carry us no further towards the knowledge and distinction of substances than a collection of those sensible ideas which we observe in them which however make with the greatest diligence and exactness we be capable of yet be more remote from the true internal constitution from which those qualities flow than as i say a countrymans idea be from the inward contrivance of that famous clock at strasburg whereof he only see the outward figure and motion there be not so contemptible a plant or animal that do not confound the most enlarge understand though the familiar use of things about us take off our wonder yet it cure not our ignorance when we come to examine the stone we tread on or the iron we daily handle we presently find we know not their make and can give no reason of the different qualities we find in them it be evident the internal constitution whereon their properties depend be unknown to us for to go no further than the grossest and most obvious we can imagine amongst them what be that texture of part that real essence that make lead and antimony fusible wood and stone not what make lead and iron malleable antimony and stone not and yet how infinitely these come short of the fine contrivances and inconceivable real essences of plant or animals every one know the workmanship of the allwise and powerful god in the great fabric of the universe and every part thereof further exceed the capacity and comprehension of the most inquisitive and intelligent man than the best contrivance of the most ingenious man doth the conceptions of the most ignorant of rational creatures therefore we in vain pretend to range things into sort and dispose them into certain class under name by their real essences that be so far from our discovery or comprehension a blind man may as soon sort things by their colour and he that have lose his smell as well distinguish a lily and a rise by their odours as by those internal constitutions which he know not he that think he can distinguish sheep and goats by their real essences that be unknown to him may be please to try his skill in those species call cassiowary and querechinchio and by their internal real essences determine the boundaries of those species without know the complex idea of sensible qualities that each of those name stand for in the countries where those animals be to be find not the substantial form which we know less those therefore who have be teach that the several species of substances have their distinct internal substantial form and that it be those form which make the distinction of substances into their true species and genera be lead yet further out of the way by have their mind set upon fruitless inquiries after substantial form wholly unintelligible and whereof we have scarce so much as any obscure or confuse conception in general that the nominal essence be that only whereby we distinguish species of substances further evident from our ideas of finite spirit and of god that our rank and distinguish natural substances into species consist in the nominal essences the mind make and not in the real essences to be find in the things themselves be further evident from our ideas of spirit for the mind get only by reflect on its own operations those simple ideas which it attribute to spirit it hath or can have no other notion of spirit but by attribute all those operations it find in itself to a sort of be without consideration of matter and even the most advance notion we have of god be but attribute the same simple ideas which we have get from reflection on what we find in ourselves and which we conceive to have more perfection in them than would be in their absence attribute i say those simple ideas to him in an unlimited degree thus have get from reflect on ourselves the idea of existence knowledge power and pleasureeach of which we find it better to have than to want and the more we have of each the betterjoining all these together with infinity to each of them we have the complex idea of an eternal omniscient omnipotent infinitely wise and happy be and though we be tell that there be different species of angels yet we know not how to frame distinct specific ideas of them not out of any conceit that the existence of more species than one of spirit be impossible but because have no more simple ideas nor be able to frame more applicable to such be but only those few take from ourselves and from the action of our own mind in think and be delight and move several part of our body we can no otherwise distinguish in our conceptions the several species of spirit one from another but by attribute those operations and power we find in ourselves to them in a higher or lower degree and so have no very distinct specific ideas of spirit except only of god to whom we attribute both duration and all those other ideas with infinity to the other spirit with limitation nor as i humbly conceive do we between god and them in our ideas put any difference by any number of simple ideas which we have of one and not of the other but only that of infinity all the particular ideas of existence knowledge will power and motion c be ideas derive from the operations of our mind we attribute all of them to all sort of spirit with the difference only of degrees to the utmost we can imagine even infinity when we would frame as well as we can an idea of the first be who yet it be certain be infinitely more remote in the real excellency of his nature from the highest and perfectest of all create be than the greatest man nay purest seraph be from the most contemptible part of matter and consequently must infinitely exceed what our narrow understand can conceive of him of finite spirit there be probably numberless species in a continuous series or gradation it be not impossible to conceive nor repugnant to reason that there may be many species of spirit as much separate and diversify one from another by distinct properties whereof we have no ideas as the species of sensible things be distinguish one from another by qualities which we know and observe in them that there should be more species of intelligent creatures above us than there be of sensible and material below us be probable to me from hence that in all the visible corporeal world we see no chasms or gap all quite down from us the descent be by easy step and a continue series of things that in each remove differ very little one from the other there be fish that have wing and be not strangers to the airy region and there be some bird that be inhabitants of the water whose blood be cold as fish and their flesh so like in taste that the scrupulous be allow them on fishdays there be animals so near of kin both to bird and beasts that they be in the middle between both amphibious animals link the terrestrial and aquatic together seal live at land and sea and porpoises have the warm blood and entrails of a hog not to mention what be confidently report of mermaids or seamen there be some brutes that seem to have as much knowledge and reason as some that be call men and the animal and vegetable kingdoms be so nearly join that if you will take the lowest of one and the highest of the other there will scarce be perceive any great difference between them and so on till we come to the lowest and the most inorganical part of matter we shall find everywhere that the several species be link together and differ but in almost insensible degrees and when we consider the infinite power and wisdom of the maker we have reason to think that it be suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe and the great design and infinite goodness of the architect that the species of creatures should also by gentle degrees ascend upward from us toward his infinite perfection as we see they gradually descend from us downwards which if it be probable we have reason then to be persuade that there be far more species of creatures above us than there be beneath we be in degrees of perfection much more remote from the infinite be of god than we be from the lowest state of be and that which approach nearest to nothing and yet of all those distinct species for the reason above say we have no clear distinct ideas the nominal essence that of the species as conceive by us prove from water and ice but to return to the species of corporeal substances if i should ask any one whether ice and water be two distinct species of things i doubt not but i should be answer in the affirmative and it can not be deny but he that say they be two distinct species be in the right but if an englishman breed in jamaica who perhaps have never see nor hear of ice come into england in the winter find the water he put in his basin at night in a great part freeze in the morning and not know any peculiar name it have should call it harden water i ask whether this would be a new species to him different from water and i think it would be answer here it would not be to him a new species no more than congeal jelly when it be cold be a distinct species from the same jelly fluid and warm or than liquid gold in the furnace be a distinct species from hard gold in the hand of a workman and if this be so it be plain that our distinct species be nothing but distinct complex ideas with distinct name annex to them it be true every substance that exist have its peculiar constitution whereon depend those sensible qualities and power we observe in it but the rank of things into species which be nothing but sort them under several title be do by us accord to the ideas that we have of them which though sufficient to distinguish them by name so that we may be able to discourse of them when we have them not present before us yet if we suppose it to be do by their real internal constitutions and that things exist be distinguish by nature into species by real essences accord as we distinguish them into species by name we shall be liable to great mistake difficulties in the supposition of a certain number of real essences to distinguish substantial be into species accord to the usual supposition that there be certain precise essences or form of things whereby all the individuals exist be by nature distinguish into species these things be necessary a crude supposition first to be assure that nature in the production of things always design them to partake of certain regulate establish essences which be to be the model of all things to be produce this in that crude sense it be usually propose would need some better explication before it can fully be assent to monstrous birth secondly it would be necessary to know whether nature always attain that essence it design in the production of things the irregular and monstrous birth that in divers sort of animals have be observe will always give us reason to doubt of one or both of these be monsters really a distinct species thirdly it ought to be determine whether those we call monsters be really a distinct species accord to the scholastic notion of the word species since it be certain that everything that exist have its particular constitution and yet we find that some of these monstrous productions have few or none of those qualities which be suppose to result from and accompany the essence of that species from whence they derive their originals and to which by their descent they seem to belong men can have no ideas of real essences fourthly the real essences of those things which we distinguish into species and as so distinguish we name ought to be know ie we ought to have ideas of them but since we be ignorant in these four point the suppose real essences of things stand us not in stead for the distinguish substances into species our nominal essences of substances not perfect collections of the properties that flow from their real essences fifthly the only imaginable help in this case would be that have frame perfect complex ideas of the properties of things flow from their different real essences we should thereby distinguish them into species but neither can this be do for be ignorant of the real essence itself it be impossible to know all those properties that flow from it and be so annex to it that any one of them be away we may certainly conclude that that essence be not there and so the thing be not of that species we can never know what be the precise number of properties depend on the real essence of gold any one of which fail the real essence of gold and consequently gold would not be there unless we know the real essence of gold itself and by that determine that species by the word gold here i must be understand to design a particular piece of matter vg the last guinea that be coin for if it should stand here in its ordinary signification for that complex idea which i or any one else call gold ie for the nominal essence of gold it would be jargon so hard be it to show the various mean and imperfection of word when we have nothing else but word to do it by hence name independent of real essences by all which it be clear that our distinguish substances into species by name be not at all found on their real essences nor can we pretend to range and determine them exactly into species accord to internal essential differences but stand for such a collection of simple substances as we have make the name stand for but since as have be remark we have need of general word though we know not the real essences of things all we can do be to collect such a number of simple ideas as by examination we find to be unite together in things exist and thereof to make one complex idea which though it be not the real essence of any substance that exist be yet the specific essence to which our name belong and be convertible with it by which we may at least try the truth of these nominal essences for example there be that say that the essence of body be extension if it be so we can never mistake in put the essence of anything for the thing itself let us then in discourse put extension for body and when we would say that body move let us say that extension move and see how ill it will look he that should say that one extension by impulse move another extension would by the bare expression sufficiently show the absurdity of such a notion the essence of anything in respect of us be the whole complex idea comprehend and mark by that name and in substances besides the several distinct simple ideas that make them up the confuse one of substance or of an unknown support and cause of their union be always a part and therefore the essence of body be not bare extension but an extend solid thing and so to say an extend solid thing move or impel another be all one and as intelligible as to say body move or impel likewise to say that a rational animal be capable of conversation be all one as to say a man but no one will say that rationality be capable of conversation because it make not the whole essence to which we give the name man our abstract ideas be to us the measure of the species we make instance in that of man there be creatures in the world that have shape like ours but be hairy and want language and reason there be naturals amongst us that have perfectly our shape but want reason and some of them language too there be creatures as it be say sit fides pen authorem but there appear no contradiction that there should be such that with language and reason and a shape in other things agree with ours have hairy tail others where the males have no beard and others where the females have if it be ask whether these be all men or no all of human species it be plain the question refer only to the nominal essence for those of them to whom the definition of the word man or the complex idea signify by the name agree be men and the other not but if the inquiry be make concern the suppose real essence and whether the internal constitution and frame of these several creatures be specifically different it be wholly impossible for us to answer no part of that go into our specific idea only we have reason to think that where the faculties or outward frame so much differ the internal constitution be not exactly the same but what difference in the real internal constitution make a specific difference it be in vain to inquire whilst our measure of species be as they be only our abstract ideas which we know and not that internal constitution which make no part of them shall the difference of hair only on the skin be a mark of a different internal specific constitution between a changeling and a drill when they agree in shape and want of reason and speech and shall not the want of reason and speech be a sign to us of different real constitutions and species between a changeling and a rea sonable man and so of the rest if we pretend that distinction of species or sort be fixedly establish by the real frame and secret constitutions of things species in animals not distinguish by generation nor let any one say that the power of propagation in animals by the mixture of male and female and in plant by seed keep the suppose real species distinct and entire for grant this to be true it would help us in the distinction of the species of things no further than the tribes of animals and vegetables what must we do for the rest but in those too it be not sufficient for if history lie not women have conceive by drill and what real species by that measure such a production will be in nature will be a new question and we have reason to think this be not impossible since mules and jumarts the one from the mixture of an ass and a mare the other from the mixture of a bull and a mare be so frequent in the world i once saw a creature that be the issue of a cat and a rat and have the plain mark of both about it wherein nature appear to have follow the pattern of neither sort alone but to have jumble them both together to which he that shall add the monstrous productions that be so frequently to be meet with in nature will find it hard even in the race of animals to determine by the pedigree of what species every animals issue be and be at a loss about the real essence which he think certainly convey by generation and have alone a right to the specific name but further if the species of animals and plant be to be distinguish only by propagation must i go to the indies to see the sire and dam of the one and the plant from which the seed be gather that produce the other to know whether this be a tiger or that tea not by substantial form upon the whole matter it be evident that it be their own collections of sensible qualities that men make the essences of their several sort of substances and that their real internal structure be not consider by the greatest part of men in the sort them much less be any substantial form ever think on by any but those who have in this one part of the world learn the language of the school and yet those ignorant men who pretend not any in sight into the real essences nor trouble themselves about substantial form but be content with know things one from another by their sensible qualities be often better acquaint with their differences can more nicely distinguish them from their use and better know what they expect from each than those learn quicksighted men who look so deep into them and talk so confidently of something more hide and essential the specific essences that be commonly make by men but suppose that the real essences of substances be discoverable by those that would severely apply themselves to that inquiry yet we could not reasonably think that the rank of things under general name be regulate by those internal real constitutions or anything else but their obvious appearances since languages in all countries have be establish long before sciences so that they have not be philosophers or logicians or such who have trouble themselves about form and essences that have make the general name that be in use amongst the several nations of men but those more or less comprehensive term have for the most part in all languages receive their birth and signification from ignorant and illiterate people who sort and denominate things by those sensible qualities they find in them thereby to signify them when absent to others whether they have an occasion to mention a sort or a particular thing therefore very various and uncertain in the ideas of different men since then it be evident that we sort and name substances by their nominal and not by their real essences the next thing to be consider be how and by whom these essences come to be make as to the latter it be evident they be make by the mind and not by nature for be they natures workmanship they could not be so various and different in several men as experience tell us they be for if we will examine it we shall not find the nominal essence of any one species of substances in all men the same no not of that which of all others we be the most intimately acquaint with it could not possibly be that the abstract idea to which the name man be give should be different in several men if it be of natures make and that to one it should be animal rationale and to another animal implume bipes latis unguibus he that annex the name to a complex idea make up of sense and spontaneous motion join to a body of such a shape have thereby one essence of the species man and he that upon further examination add rationality have another essence of the species he call man by which mean the same individual will be a true man to the one which be not so to the other i think there be scarce any one will allow this upright figure so well know to be the essential difference of the species man and yet how far men determine of the sort of animals rather by their shape than descent be very visible since it have be more than once debate whether several human foetuses should be preserve or receive to baptism or no only because of the difference of their outward configuration from the ordinary make of children without know whether they be not as capable of reason as infants cast in another mould some whereof though of an approve shape be never capable of as much appearance of reason all their live as be to be find in an ape or an elephant and never give any sign of be act by a rational soul whereby it be evident that the outward figure which only be find want and not the faculty of reason which nobody could know would be want in its due season be make essential to the human species the learn divine and lawyer must on such occasion renounce his sacred definition of animal rationale and substitute some other essence of the human species monsieur menage furnish us with an example worth the take notice of on this occasion when the abbot of saint martin say he be bear he have so little of the figure of a man that it bespake him rather a monster it be for some time under deliberation whether he should be baptize or no however he be baptize and declare a man provisionally till time should show what he would prove nature have mould him so untowardly that he be call all his life the abbot malotru ie illshaped he be of caen menagiana this child we see be very near be exclude out of the species of man barely by his shape he escape very narrowly as he be and it be certain a figure a little more oddly turn have cast him and he have be execute as a thing not to be allow to pass for a man and yet there can be no reason give why if the lineaments of his face have be a little alter a rational soul could not have be lodge in him why a visage somewhat longer or a nose flatter or a wider mouth could not have consist as well as the rest of his ill figure with such a soul such part as make him disfigure as he be capable to be a dignitary in the church nominal essences of particular substances be undetermined by nature and therefore various as men vary wherein then would i gladly know consist the precise and unmovable boundaries of that species it be plain if we examine there be no such thing make by nature and establish by her amongst men the real essence of that or any other sort of substances it be evident we know not and therefore be so undetermined in our nominal essences which we make ourselves that if several men be to be ask concern some oddly shape foetus as soon as bear whether it be a man or no it be past doubt one should meet with different answer which could not happen if the nominal essences whereby we limit and distinguish the species of substances be not make by man with some liberty but be exactly copy from precise boundaries set by nature whereby it distinguish all substances into certain species who would undertake to resolve what species that monster be of which be mention by licetus bk i c with a man head and hog body or those other which to the body of men have the head of beasts as dog horse c if any of these creatures have live and could have speak it would have increase the difficulty have the upper part to the middle be of human shape and all below swine have it be murder to destroy it or must the bishop have be consult whether it be man enough to be admit to the font or no as i have be tell it happen in france some years since in somewhat a like case so uncertain be the boundaries of species of animals to us who have no other measure than the complex ideas of our own collect and so far be we from certainly know what a man be though perhaps it will be judge great ignorance to make any doubt about it and yet i think i may say that the certain boundaries of that species be so far from be determine and the precise number of simple ideas which make the nominal essence so far from be settle and perfectly know that very material doubt may still arise about it and i imagine none of the definitions of the word man which we yet have nor descriptions of that sort of animal be so perfect and exact as to satisfy a considerate inquisitive person much less to obtain a general consent and to be that which men would everywhere stick by in the decision of case and determine of life and death baptism or no baptism in productions that might happen but not so arbitrary as mix modes but though these nominal essences of substances be make by the mind they be not yet make so arbitrarily as those of mix modes to the make of any nominal essence it be necessary first that the ideas whereof it consist have such a union as to make but one idea how compound soever secondly that the particular ideas so unite be exactly the same neither more nor less for if two abstract complex ideas differ either in number or sort of their component part they make two different and not one and the same essence in the first of these the mind in make its complex ideas of substances only follow nature and put none together which be not suppose to have a union in nature nobody join the voice of a sheep with the shape of a horse nor the colour of lead with the weight and fixedness of gold to be the complex ideas of any real substances unless he have a mind to fill his head with chimeras and his discourse with unintelligible word men observe certain qualities always join and exist together therein copy nature and of ideas so unite make their complex ones of substances for though men may make what complex ideas they please and give what name to them they will yet if they will be understand when they speak of things really exist they must in some degree conform their ideas to the things they would speak of or else mens language will be like that of babel and every man word be intelligible only to himself would no longer serve to conversation and the ordinary affairs of life if the ideas they stand for be not some way answer the common appearances and agreement of substances as they really exist our nominal essences of substances usually consist of a few obvious qualities observe in things secondly though the mind of man in make its complex ideas of substances never put any together that do not really or be not suppose to coexist and so it truly borrow that union from nature yet the number it combine depend upon the various care industry or fancy of him that make it men generally content themselves with some few sensible obvious qualities and often if not always leave out others as material and as firmly unite as those that they take of sensible substances there be two sort one of organize body which be propagate by seed and in these the shape be that which to us be the lead quality and most characteristical part that determine the species and therefore in vegetables and animals an extend solid substance of such a certain figure usually serve the turn for however some men seem to prize their definition of animal rationale yet should there a creature be find that have language and reason but partake not of the usual shape of a man i believe it would hardly pass for a man how much soever it be animal rationale and if balaams ass have all his life discourse as rationally as he do once with his master i doubt yet whether any one would have think him worthy the name man or allow him to be of the same species with himself as in vegetables and animals it be the shape so in most other body not propagate by seed it be the colour we must fix on and be most lead by thus where we find the colour of gold we be apt to imagine all the other qualities comprehend in our complex idea to be there also and we commonly take these two obvious qualities viz shape and colour for so presumptive ideas of several species that in a good picture we readily say this be a lion and that a rise this be a gold and that a silver goblet only by the different figure and colour represent to the eye by the pencil yet imperfect as they thus be they serve for com mon converse but though this serve well enough for gross and confuse conceptions and inaccurate ways of talk and think yet men be far enough from have agree on the precise number of simple ideas or qualities belong to any sort of things signify by its name nor be it a wonder since it require much time pain and skill strict inquiry and long examination to find out what and how many those simple ideas be which be constantly and inseparably unite in nature and be always to be find together in the same subject most men want either time inclination or industry enough for this even to some tolerable degree content themselves with some few obvious and outward appearances of things thereby readily to distinguish and sort them for the common affairs of life and so without further examination give them name or take up the name already in use which though in common conversation they pass well enough for the sign of some few obvious qualities coexist be yet far enough from comprehend in a settle signification a precise number of simple ideas much less all those which be unite in nature he that shall consider after so much stir about genus and species and such a deal of talk of specific differences how few word we have yet settle definitions of may with reason imagine that those form which there hath be so much noise make about be only chimeras which give us no light into the specific natures of things and he that shall consider how far the name of substances be from have significations wherein all who use them do agree will have reason to conclude that though the nominal essences of substances be all suppose to be copy from nature yet they be all or most of them very imperfect since the composition of those complex ideas be in several men very different and therefore that these boundaries of species be as men and not as nature make them if at least there be in nature any such prefix bound it be true that many particular substances be so make by nature that they have agreement and liken one with another and so afford a foundation of be rank into sort but the sort of things by us or the make of determinate species be in order to name and comprehend them under general term i can not see how it can be properly say that nature set the boundaries of the species of things or if it be so our boundaries of species be not exactly conformable to those in nature for we have need of general name for present use stay not for a perfect discovery of all those qualities which would best show us their most material differences and agreements but we ourselves divide them by certain obvious appearances into species that we may the easier under general name communicate our thoughts about them for have no other knowledge of any substance but of the simple ideas that be unite in it and observe several particular things to agree with others in several of those simple ideas we make that collection our specific idea and give it a general name that in record our thoughts and in our discourse with others we may in one short word designate all the individuals that agree in that complex idea without enumerate the simple ideas that make it up and so not waste our time and breath in tedious descriptions which we see they be fain to do who would discourse of any new sort of things they have not yet a name for essences of species under the same name very different in different mind but however these species of substances pass well enough in ordinary conversation it be plain that this complex idea wherein they observe several individuals to agree be by different men make very differently by some more and others less accurately in some this complex idea contain a greater and in others a smaller number of qualities and so be apparently such as the mind make it the yellow shin colour make gold to children others add weight malleableness and fusibility and others yet other qualities which they find join with that yellow colour as constantly as its weight and fusibility for in all these and the like qualities one have as good a right to be put into the complex idea of that substance wherein they be all join as another and therefore different men leave out or put in several simple ideas which others do not accord to their various examination skill or observation of that subject have different essences of gold which must therefore be of their own and not of natures make the more general our ideas of substances be the more incomplete and partial they be if the number of simple ideas that make the nominal essence of the lowest species or first sort of individuals depend on the mind of man variously collect them it be much more evident that they do so in the more comprehensive class which by the master of logic be call genera these be complex ideas designedly imperfect and it be visible at first sight that several of those qualities that be to be find in the things themselves be purposely leave out of generical ideas for as the mind to make general ideas comprehend several particulars leave out those of time and place and such other that make them incommunicable to more than one individual so to make other yet more general ideas that may comprehend different sort it leave out those qualities that distinguish them and put into its new collection only such ideas as be common to several sort the same convenience that make men express several parcel of yellow matter come from guinea and peru under one name set them also upon make of one name that may comprehend both gold and silver and some other body of different sort this be do by leave out those qualities which be peculiar to each sort and retain a complex idea make up of those that be common to them all to which the name metal be annex there be a genus constitute the essence whereof be that abstract idea contain only malleableness and fusibility with certain degrees of weight and fixedness wherein some body of several kinds agree leave out the colour and other qualities peculiar to gold and silver and the other sort comprehend under the name metal whereby it be plain that men follow not exactly the pattern set them by nature when they make their general ideas of substances since there be no body to be find which have barely malleableness and fusibility in it without other qualities as inseparable as those but men in make their general ideas seek more the convenience of language and quick dispatch by short and comprehensive sign than the true and precise nature of things as they exist have in the frame their abstract ideas chiefly pursue that end which be to be furnish with store of general and variously comprehensive name so that in this whole business of genera and species the genus or more comprehensive be but a partial conception of what be in the species and the species but a partial idea of what be to be find in each individual if therefore any one will think that a man and a horse and an animal and a plant c be distinguish by real essences make by nature he must think nature to be very liberal of these real essences make one for body another for an animal and another for a horse and all these essences liberally bestow upon bucephalus but if we would rightly consider what be do in all these genera and species or sort we should find that there be no new thing make but only more or less comprehensive sign whereby we may be enable to express in a few syllables great number of particular things as they agree in more or less general conceptions which we have frame to that purpose in all which we may observe that the more general term be always the name of a less complex idea and that each genus be but a partial conception of the species comprehend under it so that if these abstract general ideas be think to be complete it can only be in respect of a certain establish relation between them and certain name which be make use of to signify them and not in respect of anything exist as make by nature this all accommodate to the end of speech this be adjust to the true end of speech which be to be the easiest and shortest way of communicate our notions for thus he that would discourse of things as they agree in the complex idea of extension and solidity need but use the word body to denote all such he that to these would join others signify by the word life sense and spontaneous motion need but use the word animal to signify all which partake of those ideas and he that have make a complex idea of a body with life sense and motion with the faculty of reason and a certain shape join to it need but use the short monosyllable man to express all particulars that correspond to that complex idea this be the proper business of genus and species and this men do without any consideration of real essences or substantial form which come not within the reach of our knowledge when we think of those things nor within the signification of our word when we discourse with others instance in cassowaries be i to talk with any one of a sort of bird i lately saw in st jam park about three or four feet high with a cover of something between feather and hair of a dark brown colour without wing but in the place thereof two or three little branch come down like sprigs of spanish broom long great legs with feet only of three claw and without a tail i must make this description of it and so may make others understand me but when i be tell that the name of it be cassuaris i may then use that word to stand in discourse for all my complex idea mention in that description though by that word which be now become a specific name i know no more of the real essence or constitution of that sort of animals than i do before and know probably as much of the nature of that species of bird before i learn the name as many englishmen do of swan or herons which be specific name very well know of sort of bird common in england men determine the sort of substances which may be sort variously from what have be say it be evident that men make sort of things for it be different essences alone that make different species it be plain that they who make those abstract ideas which be the nominal essences do thereby make the species or sort should there be a body find have all the other qualities of gold except malleableness it would no doubt be make a question whether it be gold or not ie whether it be of that species this could be determine only by that abstract idea to which every one annex the name gold so that it would be true gold to him and belong to that species who include not malleableness in his nominal essence signify by the sound gold and on the other side it would not be true gold or of that species to him who include malleableness in his specific idea and who i pray be it that make these diverse species even under one and the same name but men that make two different abstract ideas consist not exactly of the same collection of qualities nor be it a mere supposition to imagine that a body may exist wherein the other obvious qualities of gold may be without malleableness since it be certain that gold itself will be sometimes so eager as artists call it that it will as little endure the hammer as glass itself what we have say of the put in or leave out of malleableness in the complex idea the name gold be by any one annex to may be say of its peculiar weight fixedness and several other the like qualities for whatever be leave out or put in it be still the complex idea to which that name be annex that make the species and as any particular parcel of matter answer that idea so the name of the sort belong truly to it and it be of that species and thus anything be true gold perfect metal all which determination of the species it be plain depend on the understand of man make this or that complex idea nature make the similitudes of substances this then in short be the case nature make many particular things which do agree one with another in many sensible qualities and probably too in their internal frame and constitution but it be not this real essence that distinguish them into species it be men who take occasion from the qualities they find unite in them and wherein they observe often several individuals to agree range them into sort in order to their name for the convenience of comprehensive sign under which individuals accord to their conformity to this or that abstract idea come to be rank as under ensigns so that this be of the blue that the red regiment this be a man that a drill and in this i think consist the whole business of genus and species the manner of sort particular be the work of fallible men though nature make things alike i do not deny but nature in the constant production of particular be make them not always new and various but very much alike and of kin one to another but i think it nevertheless true that the boundaries of the species whereby men sort them be make by men since the essences of the species distinguish by different name be as have be prove of man make and seldom adequate to the internal nature of the things they be take from so that we may truly say such a manner of sort of things be the workmanship of men each abstract idea with a name to it make a nominal essence one thing i doubt not but will seem very strange in this doctrine which be that from what have be say it will follow that each abstract idea with a name to it make a distinct species but who can help it if truth will have it so for so it must remain till somebody can show us the species of things limit and distinguish by something else and let us see that general term signify not our abstract ideas but something different from them i would fain know why a shock and a hound be not as distinct species as a spaniel and an elephant we have no other idea of the different essence of an elephant and a spaniel than we have of the different essence of a shock and a hound all the essential difference whereby we know and distinguish them one from another consist only in the different collection of simple ideas to which we have give those different name how genera and species be relate to name how much the make of species and genera be in order to general name and how much general name be necessary if not to the be yet at least to the complete of a species and make it pass for such will appear besides what have be say above concern ice and water in a very familiar example a silent and a strike watch be but one species to those who have but one name for them but he that have the name watch for one and clock for the other and distinct complex ideas to which those name belong to him they be different species it will be say perhaps that the inward contrivance and constitution be different between these two which the watchmaker have a clear idea of and yet it be plain they be but one species to him when he have but one name for them for what be sufficient in the inward contrivance to make a new species there be some watch that be make with four wheel others with five be this a specific difference to the workman some have string and physies and others none some have the balance loose and others regulate by a spiral spring and others by hog bristle be any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to the workman that know each of these and several other different contrivances in the internal constitutions of watch it be certain each of these hath a real difference from the rest but whether it be an essential a specific difference or no relate only to the complex idea to which the name watch be give as long as they all agree in the idea which that name stand for and that name do not as a generical name comprehend different species under it they be not essentially nor specifically different but if any one will make minuter divisions from differences that he know in the internal frame of watch and to such precise complex ideas give name that shall prevail they will then be new species to them who have those ideas with name to them and can by those differences distinguish watch into these several sort and then watch will be a generical name but yet they would be no distinct species to men ignorant of clockwork and the inward contrivances of watch who have no other idea but the outward shape and bulk with the mark of the hours by the hand for to them all those other name would be but synonymous term for the same idea and signify no more nor no other thing but a watch just thus i think it be in natural things nobody will doubt that the wheel or spring if i may so say within be different in a rational man and a changeling no more than that there be a difference in the frame between a drill and a changeling but whether one or both these differences be essential or specifical be only to be know to us by their agreement or disagreement with the complex idea that the name man stand for for by that alone can it be determine whether one or both or neither of those be a man species of artificial things less confuse than natural from what have be before say we may see the reason why in the species of artificial things there be generally less confusion and uncertainty than in natural because an artificial thing be a production of man which the artificer design and therefore well know the idea of the name of it be suppose to stand for no other idea nor to import any other essence than what be certainly to be know and easy enough to be apprehend for the idea or essence of the several sort of artificial things consist for the most part in nothing but the determinate figure of sensible part and sometimes motion depend thereon which the artificer fashion in matter such as he find for his turn it be not beyond the reach of our faculties to attain a certain idea thereof and so settle the signification of the name whereby the species of artificial things be distinguish with less doubt obscurity and equivocation than we can in things natural whose differences and operations depend upon contrivances beyond the reach of our discoveries artificial things of distinct species i must be excuse here if i think artificial things be of distinct species as well as natural since i find they be as plainly and orderly rank into sort by different abstract ideas with general name annex to them as distinct one from another as those of natural substances for why should we not think a watch and pistol as distinct species one from another as a horse and a dog they be express in our mind by distinct ideas and to others by distinct appellations substances alone of all our several sort of ideas have proper name this be further to be observe concern substances that they alone of all our several sort of ideas have particular or proper name whereby one only particular thing be signify because in simple ideas modes and relations it seldom happen that men have occasion to mention often this or that particular when it be absent besides the greatest part of mix modes be action which perish in their birth be not capable of a last duration as substances which be the actors and wherein the simple ideas that make up the complex ideas design by the name have a last union difficult to lead another by word into the thoughts of things strip of those abstract ideas we give them i must beg pardon of my reader for have dwell so long upon this subject and perhaps with some obscurity but i desire it may be consider how difficult it be to lead another by word into the thoughts of things strip of those specifical differences we give them which things if i name not i say nothing and if i do name them i thereby rank them into some sort or other and suggest to the mind the usual abstract idea of that species and so cross my purpose for to talk of a man and to lay by at the same time the ordinary signification of the name man which be our complex idea usually annex to it and bid the reader consider man as he be in himself and as he be really distinguish from others in his internal constitution or real essence that be by something he know not what look like trifle and yet thus one must do who would speak of the suppose real essences and species of things as think to be make by nature if it be but only to make it understand that there be no such thing signify by the general name which substances be call by but because it be difficult by know familiar name to do this give me leave to endeavour by an example to make the different consideration the mind have of specific name and ideas a little more clear and to show how the complex ideas of modes be refer sometimes to archetypes in the mind of other intelligent be or which be the same to the signification annex by others to their receive name and sometimes to no archetypes at all give me leave also to show how the mind always refer its ideas of substances either to the substances themselves or to the signification of their name as to the archetypes and also to make plain the nature of species or sort of things as apprehend and make use of by us and of the essences belong to those species which be perhaps of more moment to discover the extent and certainty of our knowledge than we at first imagine instance of mix modes name kinneah and niouph let us suppose adam in the state of a grow man with a good understand but in a strange country with all things new and unknown about him and no other faculties to attain the knowledge of them but what one of this age have now he observe lamech more melancholy than usual and imagine it to be from a suspicion he have of his wife adah whom he most ardently love that she have too much kindness for another man adam discourse these his thoughts to eve and desire her to take care that adah commit not folly and in these discourse with eve he make use of these two new word kinneah and niouph in time adams mistake appear for he find lamechs trouble proceed from have kill a man but yet the two name kinneah and niouph the one stand for suspicion in a husband of his wifes disloyalty to him and the other for the act of commit disloyalty lose not their distinct significations it be plain then that here be two distinct complex ideas of mix modes with name to them two distinct species of action essentially different i ask wherein consist the essences of these two distinct species of action and it be plain it consist in a precise combination of simple ideas different in one from the other i ask whether the complex idea in adams mind which he call kinneah be adequate or not and it be plain it be for it be a combination of simple ideas which he without any regard to any archetype without respect to anything as a pattern voluntarily put together abstract and give the name kinneah to to express in short to others by that one sound all the simple ideas contain and unite in that complex one it must necessarily follow that it be an adequate idea his own choice have make that combination it have all in it he intend it should and so could not but be perfect could not but be adequate it be refer to no other archetype which it be suppose to represent these word kinneah and niouph by degrees grow into common use and then the case be somewhat alter adams children have the same faculties and thereby the same power that he have to make what complex ideas of mix modes they please in their own mind to abstract them and make what sound they please the sign of them but the use of name be to make our ideas within us know to others that can not be do but when the same sign stand for the same idea in two who would communicate their thoughts and discourse together those therefore of adams children that find these two word kinneah and niouph in familiar use could not take them for insignificant sound but must need conclude they stand for something for certain ideas abstract ideas they be general name which abstract ideas be the essences of the species distinguish by those name if therefore they would use these word as name of species already establish and agree on they be oblige to conform the ideas in their mind signify by these name to the ideas that they stand for in other mens mind as to their pattern and archetypes and then indeed their ideas of these complex modes be liable to be inadequate as be very apt especially those that consist of combinations of many simple ideas not to be exactly conformable to the ideas in other mens mind use the same name though for this there be usually a remedy at hand which be to ask the mean of any word we understand not of him that use it it be as impossible to know certainly what the word jealousy and adultery stand for in another man mind with whom i would discourse about them as it be impossible in the begin of language to know what kinneah and niouph stand for in another man mind without explication they be voluntary sign in every one instance of a species of substance name zahab let us now also consider after the same manner the name of substances in their first application one of adams children rove in the mountains light on a glitter substance which please his eye home he carry it to adam who upon consideration of it find it to be hard to have a bright yellow colour and an exceed great weight these perhaps at first be all the qualities he take notice of in it and abstract this complex idea consist of a substance have that peculiar bright yellowness and a weight very great in proportion to its bulk he give the name zahab to denominate and mark all substances that have these sensible qualities in them it be evident now that in this case adam act quite differently from what he do before in form those ideas of mix modes to which he give the name kinneah and niouph for there he put ideas together only by his own imagination not take from the existence of anything and to them he give name to denominate all things that should happen to agree to those his abstract ideas without consider whether any such thing do exist or not the standard there be of his own make but in the form his idea of this new substance he take the quite contrary course here he have a standard make by nature and therefore be to represent that to himself by the idea he have of it even when it be absent he put in no simple idea into his complex one but what he have the perception of from the thing itself he take care that his idea be conformable to this archetype and intend the name should stand for an idea so conformable this piece of matter thus denominate zahab by adam be quite different from any he have see before nobody i think will deny to be a distinct species and to have its peculiar essence and that the name zahab be the mark of the species and a name belong to all things partake in that essence but here it be plain the essence adam make the name zahab stand for be nothing but a body hard shin yellow and very heavy but the inquisitive mind of man not content with the knowledge of these as i may say superficial qualities put adam upon further examination of this matter he therefore knock and beat it with flints to see what be discoverable in the inside he find it yield to blow but not easily separate into piece he find it will bend without break be not now ductility to be add to his former idea and make part of the essence of the species that name zahab stand for further trials discover fusibility and fixedness be not they also by the same reason that any of the others be to be put into the complex idea signify by the name zahab if not what reason will there be show more for the one than the other if these must then all the other properties which any further trials shall discover in this matter ought by the same reason to make a part of the ingredients of the complex idea which the name zahab stand for and so be the essence of the species mark by that name which properties because they be endless it be plain that the idea make after this fashion by this archetype will be always inadequate the abstract ideas of substances always imperfect and therefore various but this be not all it would also follow that the name of substances would not only have as in truth they have but would also be suppose to have different significations as use by different men which would very much cumber the use of language for if every distinct quality that be discover in any matter by any one be suppose to make a necessary part of the complex idea signify by the common name give to it it must follow that men must suppose the same word to signify different things in different men since they can not doubt but different men may have discover several qualities in substances of the same denomination which others know nothing of therefore to fix their nominal species a real essense be suppose to avoid this therefore they have suppose a real essence belong to every species from which these properties all flow and would have their name of the species stand for that but they not have any idea of that real essence in substances and their word signify nothing but the ideas they have that which be do by this attempt be only to put the name or sound in the place and stead of the thing have that real essence without know what the real essence be and this be that which men do when they speak of species of things as suppose them make by nature and distinguish by real essences which supposition be of no use for let us consider when we affirm that all gold be fix either it mean that fixedness be a part of the definition ie part of the nominal essence the word gold stand for and so this affirmation all gold be fix contain nothing but the signification of the term gold or else it mean that fixedness not be a part of the definition of the gold be a property of that substance itself in which case it be plain that the word gold stand in the place of a substance have the real essence of a species of things make by nature in which way of substitution it have so confuse and uncertain a signification that though this propositiongold be fixedbe in that sense an affirmation of something real yet it be a truth will always fail us in its particular application and so be of no real use or certainty for let it be ever so true that all gold ie all that have the real essence of gold be fix what serve this for whilst we know not in this sense what be or be not gold for if we know not the real essence of gold it be impossible we should know what parcel of matter have that essence and so whether it be true gold or no conclusion to conclude what liberty adam have at first to make any complex ideas of mix modes by no other pattern but by his own thoughts the same have all men ever since have and the same necessity of conform his ideas of substances to things without him as to archetypes make by nature that adam be under if he would not wilfully impose upon himself the same be all men ever since under too the same liberty also that adam have of affix any new name to any idea the same have any one still especially the beginners of languages if we can imagine any such but only with this difference that in place where men in society have already establish a language amongst them the significations of word be very warily and sparingly to be alter because men be furnish already with name for their ideas and common use have appropriate know name to certain ideas an affect misapplication of them can not but be very ridiculous he that hath new notions will perhaps venture sometimes on the coin of new term to express them but men think it a boldness and it be uncertain whether common use will ever make them pass for current but in communication with others it be necessary that we conform the ideas we make the vulgar word of any language stand for to their know proper significations which i have explain at large already or else to make know that new signification we apply them to ii of particles particles connect part or whole sentence together besides word which be name of ideas in the mind there be a great many others that be make use of to signify the connexion that the mind give to ideas or to proposition one with another the mind in communicate its thoughts to others do not only need sign of the ideas it have then before it but others also to show or intimate some particular action of its own at that time relate to those ideas this it do several ways as be and be not be the general mark of the mind affirm or deny but besides affirmation or negation without which there be in word no truth or falsehood the mind do in declare its sentiments to others connect not only the part of proposition but whole sentence one to another with their several relations and dependencies to make a coherent discourse in right use of particles consist the art of wellspeaking the word whereby it signify what connexion it give to the several affirmations and negations that it unite in one continue reason or narration be generally call particles and it be in the right use of these that more particularly consist the clearness and beauty of a good style to think well it be not enough that a man have ideas clear and distinct in his thoughts nor that he observe the agreement or disagreement of some of them but he must think in train and observe the dependence of his thoughts and reason upon one another and to express well such methodical and rational thoughts he must have word to show what connexion restriction distinction opposition emphasis c he give to each respective part of his discourse to mistake in any of these be to puzzle instead of inform his hearer and therefore it be that those word which be not truly by themselves the name of any ideas be of such constant and indispensable use in language and do much contribute to mens well express themselves they show what relation the mind give to its own thoughts this part of grammar have be perhaps as much neglect as some others overdiligently cultivate it be easy for men to write one after another of case and genders moods and tense gerunds and supines in these and the like there have be great diligence use and particles themselves in some languages have be with great show of exactness rank into their several order but though prepositions and conjunctions c be name well know in grammar and the particles contain under them carefully rank into their distinct subdivisions yet he who would show the right use of particles and what significancy and force they have must take a little more pain enter into his own thoughts and observe nicely the several posture of his mind in discourse they be all mark of some action or intimation of the mind neither be it enough for the explain of these word to render them as be usual in dictionaries by word of another tongue which come nearest to their signification for what be mean by them be commonly as hard to be understand in one as another language they be all mark of some action or intimation of the mind and therefore to understand them rightly the several view posture stand turn limitations and exceptions and several other thoughts of the mind for which we have either none or very deficient name be diligently to be study of these there be a great variety much exceed the number of particles that most languages have to express them by and therefore it be not to be wonder that most of these particles have divers and sometimes almost opposite significations in the hebrew tongue there be a particle consist of but one single letter of which there be reckon up as i remember seventy i be sure above fifty several significations instance in but but be a particle none more familiar in our language and he that say it be a discretive conjunction and that it answer to sed latin or mais in french think he have sufficiently explain it but yet it seem to me to intimate several relations the mind give to the several proposition or part of them which it join by this monosyllable first but to say no more here it intimate a stop of the mind in the course it be go before it come quite to the end of it secondly i saw but two plant here it show that the mind limit the sense to what be express with a negation of all other thirdly you pray but it be not that god would bring you to the true religion fourthly but that he would confirm you in your own the first of these buts intimate a supposition in the mind of something otherwise than it should be the latter show that the mind make a direct opposition between that and what go before it fifthly all animals have sense but a dog be an animal here it signify little more but that the latter proposition be join to the former as the minor of a syllogism this matter of the use of particles but lightly touch here to these i doubt not might be add a great many other significations of this particle if it be my business to examine it in its full latitude and consider it in all the place it be to be find which if one should do i doubt whether in all those manners it be make use of it would deserve the title of discretive which grammarians give to it but i intend not here a full explication of this sort of sign the instance i have give in this one may give occasion to reflect on their use and force in language and lead us into the contemplation of several action of our mind in discourse which it have find a way to intimate to others by these particles some whereof constantly and others in certain constructions have the sense of a whole sentence contain in them iii of abstract and concrete term abstract term not predictable one of another and why the ordinary word of language and our common use of them would have give us light into the nature of our ideas if they have be but consider with attention the mind as have be show have a power to abstract its ideas and so they become essences general essences whereby the sort of things be distinguish now each abstract idea be distinct so that of any two the one can never be the other the mind will by its intuitive knowledge perceive their difference and therefore in proposition no two whole ideas can ever be affirm one of another this we see in the common use of language which permit not any two abstract word or name of abstract ideas to be affirm one of another for how near of kin soever they may seem to be and how certain soever it be that man be an animal or rational or white yet every one at first hear perceive the falsehood of these proposition humanity be animality or rationality or whiten and this be as evident as any of the most allow maxims all our affirmations then be only in concrete which be the affirm not one abstract idea to be another but one abstract idea to be join to another which abstract ideas in substances may be of any sort in all the rest be little else but of relations and in substances the most frequent be of power vg a man be white signify that the thing that have the essence of a man have also in it the essence of whiten which be nothing but a power to produce the idea of whiten in one whose eye can discover ordinary object or a man be rational signify that the same thing that hath the essence of a man hath also in it the essence of rationality ie a power of reason they show the difference of our ideas this distinction of name show us also the difference of our ideas for if we observe them we shall find that our simple ideas have all abstract as well as concrete name the one whereof be to speak the language of grammarians a substantive the other an adjective as whiten white sweetness sweet the like also hold in our ideas of modes and relations as justice just equality equal only with this difference that some of the concrete name of relations amongst men chiefly be substantives as paternitas pater whereof it be easy to render a reason but as to our ideas of substances we have very few or no abstract name at all for though the school have introduce animalitas humanitas corporietas and some others yet they hold no proportion with that infinite number of name of substances to which they never be ridiculous enough to attempt the coin of abstract ones and those few that the school forge and put into the mouth of their scholars could never yet get admittance into common use or obtain the license of public approbation which seem to me at least to intimate the confession of all mankind that they have no ideas of the real essences of substances since they have not name for such ideas which no doubt they would have have have not their consciousness to themselves of their ignorance of them keep them from so idle an attempt and therefore though they have ideas enough to distinguish gold from a stone and metal from wood yet they but timorously venture on such term as aurietas and saxietas metallietas and lignietas or the like name which should pretend to signify the real essences of those substances whereof they know they have no ideas and indeed it be only the doctrine of substantial form and the confidence of mistake pretenders to a knowledge that they have not which first coin and then introduce animalitas and humanitas and the like which yet go very little further than their own school and could never get to be current amongst understand men indeed humanitas be a word in familiar use amongst the romans but in a far different sense and stand not for the abstract essence of any substance but be the abstract name of a mode and its concrete humanus not homo of the imperfection of word word be use for record and communicate our thoughts from what have be say in the forego chapters it be easy to perceive what imperfection there be in language and how the very nature of word make it almost unavoidable for many of them to be doubtful and uncertain in their significations to examine the perfection or imperfection of word it be necessary first to consider their use and end for as they be more or less fit to attain that so they be more or less perfect we have in the former part of this discourse often upon occasion mention a double use of word first one for the record of our own thoughts secondly the other for the communicate of our thoughts to others any word will serve for record as to the first of these for the record our own thoughts for the help of our own memories whereby as it be we talk to ourselves any word will serve the turn for since sound be voluntary and indifferent sign of any ideas a man may use what word he please to signify his own ideas to himself and there will be no imperfection in them if he constantly use the same sign for the same idea for then he can not fail of have his mean understand wherein consist the right use and perfection of language communication by word either for civil or philosophical purpose secondly as to communication by word that too have a double use i civil ii philosophical first by their civil use i mean such a communication of thoughts and ideas by word as may serve for the uphold common conversation and commerce about the ordinary affairs and conveniences of civil life in the societies of men one amongst another secondly by the philosophical use of word i mean such a use of them as may serve to convey the precise notions of things and to express in general proposition certain and undoubted truths which the mind may rest upon and be satisfy with in its search after true knowledge these two use be very distinct and a great deal less exactness will serve in the one than in the other as we shall see in what follow the imperfection of word be the doubtfulness or ambiguity of their signification which be cause by the sort of ideas they stand for the chief end of language in communication be to be understand word serve not well for that end neither in civil nor philosophical discourse when any word do not excite in the hearer the same idea which it stand for in the mind of the speaker now since sound have no natural connexion with our ideas but have all their signification from the arbitrary imposition of men the doubtfulness and uncertainty of their signification which be the imperfection we here be speak of have its cause more in the ideas they stand for than in any incapacity there be in one sound more than in another to signify any idea for in that regard they be all equally perfect that then which make doubtfulness and uncertainty in the signification of some more than other word be the difference of ideas they stand for natural cause of their imperfection especially in those that stand for mix modes and for our ideas of substances word have naturally no signification the idea which each stand for must be learn and retain by those who would exchange thoughts and hold intelligible discourse with others in any language but this be the hardest to be do where first the ideas they stand for be very complex and make up of a great number of ideas put together secondly where the ideas they stand for have no certain connexion in nature and so no settle standard anywhere in nature exist to rectify and adjust them by thirdly when the signification of the word be refer to a standard which standard be not easy to be know fourthly where the signification of the word and the real essence of the thing be not exactly the same these be difficulties that attend the signification of several word that be intelligible those which be not intelligible at all such as name stand for any simple ideas which another have not organs or faculties to attain as the name of colour to a blind man or sound to a deaf man need not here be mention in all these case we shall find an imperfection in word which i shall more at large explain in their particular application to our several sort of ideas for if we examine them we shall find that the name of mix modes be most liable to doubtfulness and imperfection for the two first of these reason and the name of substances chiefly for the two latter the name of mix modes doubtful first because the ideas they stand for be so complex first the name of mix modes be many of them liable to great uncertainty and obscurity in their signification i because of that great composition these complex ideas be often make up of to make word serviceable to the end of communication it be necessary as have be say that they excite in the hearer exactly the same idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker without this men fill one anothers head with noise and sound but convey not thereby their thoughts and lay not before one another their ideas which be the end of discourse and language but when a word stand for a very complex idea that be compound and decompounded it be not easy for men to form and retain that idea so exactly as to make the name in common use stand for the same precise idea without any the least variation hence it come to pass that mens name of very compound ideas such as for the most part be moral word have seldom in two different men the same precise signification since one man complex idea seldom agree with anothers and often differ from his ownfrom that which he have yesterday or will have tomorrow secondly because they have no standards in nature because the name of mix modes for the most part want standards in nature whereby men may rectify and adjust their significations therefore they be very various and doubtful they be assemblages of ideas put together at the pleasure of the mind pursue its own end of discourse and suit to its own notions whereby it design not to copy anything really exist but to denominate and rank things as they come to agree with those archetypes or form it have make he that first bring the word sham or wheedle or banter in use put together as he think fit those ideas he make it stand for and as it be with any new name of modes that be now bring into any language so it be with the old ones when they be first make use of name therefore that stand for collections of ideas which the mind make at pleasure must need be of doubtful signification when such collections be nowhere to be find constantly unite in nature nor any pattern to be show whereby men may adjust them what the word murder or sacrilege c signify can never be know from things themselves there be many of the part of those complex ideas which be not visible in the action itself the intention of the mind or the relation of holy things which make a part of murder or sacrilege have no necessary connexion with the outward and visible action of him that commit either and the pull the trigger of the gun with which the murder be commit and be all the action that perhaps be visible have no natural connexion with those other ideas that make up the complex one name murder they have their union and combination only from the understand which unite them under one name but unite them without any rule or pattern it can not be but that the signification of the name that stand for such voluntary collections should be often various in the mind of different men who have scarce any stand rule to regulate themselves and their notions by in such arbitrary ideas common use or propriety not a sufficient remedy it be true common use that be the rule of propriety may be suppose here to afford some aid to settle the signification of language and it can not be deny but that in some measure it do common use regulate the mean of word pretty well for common conversation but nobody have an authority to establish the precise signification of word nor determine to what ideas any one shall annex them common use be not sufficient to adjust them to philosophical discourse there be scarce any name of any very complex idea to say nothing of others which in common use have not a great latitude and which keep within the bound of propriety may not be make the sign of far different ideas besides the rule and measure of propriety itself be nowhere establish it be often matter of dispute whether this or that way of use a word be propriety of speech or no from all which it be evident that the name of such kind of very complex ideas be naturally liable to this imperfection to be of doubtful and uncertain signification and even in men that have a mind to understand one another do not always stand for the same idea in speaker and hearer though the name glory and gratitude be the same in every man mouth through a whole country yet the complex collective idea which every one think on or intend by that name be apparently very different in men use the same language the way of learn these name contribute also to their doubtfulness the way also wherein the name of mix modes be ordinarily learn do not a little contribute to the doubtfulness of their signification for if we will observe how children learn languages we shall find that to make them understand what the name of simple ideas or substances stand for people ordinarily show them the thing whereof they would have them have the idea and then repeat to them the name that stand for it as white sweet milk sugar cat dog but as for mix modes especially the most material of them moral word the sound be usually learn first and then to know what complex ideas they stand for they be either behold to the explication of others or which happen for the most part be leave to their own observation and industry which be little lay out in the search of the true and precise mean of name these moral word be in most mens mouth little more than bare sound or when they have any it be for the most part but a very loose and undetermined and consequently obscure and confuse signification and even those themselves who have with more attention settle their notions do yet hardly avoid the inconvenience to have them stand for complex ideas different from those which other even intelligent and studious men make them the sign of where shall one find any either controversial debate or familiar discourse concern honour faith grace religion church c wherein it be not easy to observe the different notions men have of them which be nothing but this that they be not agree in the signification of those word nor have in their mind the same complex ideas which they make them stand for and so all the contest that follow thereupon be only about the mean of a sound and hence we see that in the interpretation of laws whether divine or human there be no end comment beget comment and explications make new matter for explications and of limit distinguish vary the signification of these moral word there be no end these ideas of mens make be by men still have the same power multiply in infinitum many a man who be pretty well satisfy of the mean of a text of scripture or clause in the code at first read have by consult commentators quite lose the sense of it and by these elucidations give rise or increase to his doubt and draw obscurity upon the place i say not this that i think commentaries needle but to show how uncertain the name of mix modes naturally be even in the mouth of those who have both the intention and the faculty of speak as clearly as language be ca pable to express their thoughts hence unavoidable obscurity in ancient author what obscurity this have unavoidably bring upon the write of men who have live in remote age and different countries it will be needle to take notice since the numerous volumes of learn men employ their thoughts that way be proof more than enough to show what attention study sagacity and reason be require to find out the true mean of ancient author but there be no write we have any great concernment to be very solicitous about the mean of but those that contain either truths we be require to believe or laws we be to obey and draw inconvenience on us when we mistake or transgress we may be less anxious about the sense of other author who write but their own opinions we be under no greater necessity to know them than they to know ours our good or evil depend not on their decree we may safely be ignorant of their notions and therefore in the read of them if they do not use their word with a due clearness and perspicuity we may lay them aside and without any injury do them resolve thus with ourselves si non vis intelligi debes negligi name of substances of doubtful signification because the ideas they stand for relate to the reality of things if the signification of the name of mix modes be uncertain because there be no real standards exist in nature to which those ideas be refer and by which they may be adjust the name of substances be of a doubtful signification for a contrary reason viz because the ideas they stand for be suppose conformable to the reality of things and be refer to as standards make by nature in our ideas of substances we have not the liberty as in mix modes to frame what combinations we think fit to be the characteristical note to rank and denominate things by in these we must follow nature suit our complex ideas to real existences and regulate the signification of their name by the things themselves if we will have our name to be sign of them and stand for them here it be true we have pattern to follow but pattern that will make the signification of their name very uncertain for name must be of a very unsteady and various mean if the ideas they stand for be refer to standards without us that either can not be know at all or can be know but imperfectly and uncertainly name of substances refer to real essences that can not be know the name of substances have as have be show a double reference in their ordinary use first sometimes they be make to stand for and so their signification be suppose to agree to the real constitution of things from which all their properties flow and in which they all centre but this real constitution or as it be apt to be call essence be utterly unknown to us any sound that be put to stand for it must be very uncertain in its application and it will be impossible to know what things be or ought to be call a horse or antimony when those word be put for real essences that we have no ideas of at all and therefore in this supposition the name of substances be refer to standards that can not be know their significations can never be adjust and establish by those standards to coexist qualities which be know but imperfectly secondly the simple ideas that be find to coexist in substances be that which their name immediately signify these as unite in the several sort of things be the proper standards to which their name be refer and by which their significations may be best rectify but neither will these archetypes so well serve to this purpose as to leave these name without very various and uncertain significations because these simple ideas that coexist and be unite in the same subject be very numerous and have all an equal right to go into the complex specific idea which the specific name be to stand for men though they propose to themselves the very same subject to consider yet frame very different ideas about it and so the name they use for it unavoidably come to have in several men very different significations the simple qualities which make up the complex ideas be most of them power in relation to change which they be apt to make in or receive from other body be almost infinite he that shall but observe what a great variety of alterations any one of the baser metal be apt to receive from the different application only of fire and how much a greater number of change any of them will receive in the hand of a chymist by the application of other body will not think it strange that i count the properties of any sort of body not easy to be collect and completely know by the ways of inquiry which our faculties be capable of they be therefore at least so many that no man can know the precise and definite number they be differently discover by different men accord to their various skill attention and ways of handle who therefore can not choose but have different ideas of the same substance and therefore make the signification of its common name very various and uncertain for the complex ideas of substances be make up of such simple ones as be suppose to coexist in nature every one have a right to put into his complex idea those qualities he have find to be unite together for though in the substance of gold one satisfy himself with colour and weight yet another think solubility in aqua regia as necessary to be join with that colour in his idea of gold as any one do its fusibility solubility in aqua regia be a quality as constantly join with its colour and weight as fusibility or any other others put into it ductility or fixedness c as they have be teach by tradition or experience who of all these have establish the right signification of the word gold or who shall be the judge to determine each have his standard in nature which he appeal to and with reason think he have the same right to put into his complex idea signify by the word gold those qualities which upon trial he have find unite as another who have not so well examine have to leave them out or a third who have make other trials have to put in others for the union in nature of these qualities be the true grind of their union in one complex idea who can say one of them have more reason to be put in or leave out than another from hence it will unavoid ably follow that the complex ideas of substances in men use the same name for them will be very various and so the significations of those name very uncertain thirdly to coexist qualities which be know but imperfectly besides there be scarce any particular thing exist which in some of its simple ideas do not communicate with a greater and in others a less number of particular be who shall determine in this case which be those that be to make up the precise collection that be to be signify by the specific name or can with any just authority prescribe which obvious or common qualities be to be leave out or which more secret or more particular be to be put into the signification of the name of any substance all which together seldom or never fall to produce that various and doubtful signification in the name of substances which cause such uncertainty dispute or mistake when we come to a philosophical use of them with this imperfection they may serve for civil but not well for philosophical use it be true as to civil and common conversation the general name of substances regulate in their ordinary signification by some obvious qualities as by the shape and figure in things of know seminal propagation and in other substances for the most part by colour join with some other sensible qualities do well enough to design the things men would be understand to speak of and so they usually conceive well enough the substances mean by the word gold or apple to distinguish the one from the other but in philosophical inquiries and debate where general truths be to be establish and consequences draw from position lay down there the precise signification of the name of substances will be find not only not to be well establish but also very hard to be so for example he that shall make malleability or a certain degree of fixedness a part of his complex idea of gold may make proposition concern gold and draw consequences from them that will truly and clearly follow from gold take in such a signification but yet such as another man can never be force to admit nor be convince of their truth who make not malleableness or the same degree of fixedness part of that com plex idea that the name gold in his use of it stand for instance liquor this be a natural and almost unavoidable imperfection in almost all the name of substances in all languages whatsoever which men will easily find when once pass from confuse or loose notions they come to more strict and close inquiries for then they will be convince how doubtful and obscure those word be in their signification which in ordinary use appear very clear and determine i be once in a meet of very learn and ingenious physicians where by chance there arise a question whether any liquor pass through the filaments of the nerve the debate have be manage a good while by variety of arguments on both side i who have be use to suspect that the greatest part of dispute be more about the signification of word than a real difference in the conception of things desire that before they go any further on in this dispute they would first examine and establish amongst them what the word liquor signify they at first be a little surprise at the proposal and have they be persons less ingenious they might perhaps have take it for a very frivolous or extravagant one since there be no one there that think not himself to understand very perfectly what the word liquor stand for which i think too none of the most perplex name of substances however they be please to comply with my motion and upon examination find that the signification of that word be not so settle or certain as they have all imagine but that each of them make it a sign of a different complex idea this make them perceive that the main of their dispute be about the signification of that term and that they differ very little in their opinions concern some fluid and subtle matter pass through the conduits of the nerve though it be not so easy to agree whether it be to be call liquor or no a thing which when consider they think it not worth the contend about instance gold how much this be the case in the greatest part of dispute that men be engage so hotly in i shall perhaps have an occasion in another place to take notice let us only here consider a little more ex actly the forementioned instance of the word gold and we shall see how hard it be precisely to determine its signification i think all agree to make it stand for a body of a certain yellow shin colour which be the idea to which children have annex that name the shin yellow part of a peacocks tail be properly to them gold others find fusibility join with that yellow colour in certain parcel of matter make of that combination a complex idea to which they give the name gold to denote a sort of substances and so exclude from be gold all such yellow shin body as by fire will be reduce to ash and admit to be of that species or to be comprehend under that name gold only such substances as have that shin yellow colour will by fire be reduce to fusion and not to ash another by the same reason add the weight which be a quality as straightly join with that colour as its fusibility he think have the same reason to be join in its idea and to be signify by its name and therefore the other make up of body of such a colour and fusibility to be imperfect and so on of all the rest wherein no one can show a reason why some of the inseparable qualities that be always unite in nature should be put into the nominal essence and others leave out or why the word gold signify that sort of body the ring on his finger be make of should determine that sort rather by its colour weight and fusibility than by its colour weight and solubility in aqua regia since the dissolve it by that liquor be as inseparable from it as the fusion by fire and they be both of them nothing but the relation which that substance have to two other body which have a power to operate differently upon it for by what right be it that fusibility come to be a part of the essence signify by the word gold and solubility but a property of it or why be its colour part of the essence and its malleableness but a property that which i mean be this that these be all but properties depend on its real constitution and nothing but power either active or passive in reference to other body no one have authority to determine the signification of the word gold as refer to such a body exist in nature more to one collection of ideas to be find in that body than to another whereby the signification of that name must unavoidably be very uncertain since as have be say several people observe several properties in the same substance and i think i may say nobody all and therefore we have but very imperfect descriptions of things and word have very uncertain significations the name of simple ideas the least doubtful from what have be say it be easy to observe what have be before remark viz that the name of simple ideas be of all others the least liable to mistake and that for these reason first because the ideas they stand for be each but one single perception be much easier get and more clearly retain than the more complex ones and therefore be not liable to the uncertainty which usually attend those compound ones of substances and mix modes in which the precise number of simple ideas that make them up be not easily agree so readily keep in mind and secondly because they be never refer to any other essence but barely that perception they immediately signify which reference be that which render the signification of the name of substances naturally so perplex and give occasion to so many dispute men that do not perversely use their word or on purpose set themselves to cavil seldom mistake in any language which they be acquaint with the use and signification of the name of simple ideas white and sweet yellow and bitter carry a very obvious mean with them which every one precisely comprehend or easily perceive he be ignorant of and seek to be inform but what precise collection of simple ideas modesty or frugality stand for in anothers use be not so certainly know and however we be apt to think we well enough know what be mean by gold or iron yet the precise complex idea others make them the sign of be not so certain and i believe it be very seldom that in speaker and hearer they stand for exactly the same collection which must need produce mistake and dispute when they be make use of in discourse wherein men have to do with universal proposition and would settle in their mind universal truths and consider the consequences that follow from them and next to them simple modes by the same rule the name of simple modes be next to those of simple ideas least liable to doubt and uncertainty especially those of figure and number of which men have so clear and distinct ideas who ever that have a mind to understand them mistake the ordinary mean of seven or a triangle and in general the least compound ideas in every kind have the least dubious name the most doubtful be the name of very compound mix modes and substances mix modes therefore that be make up but of a few and obvious simple ideas have usually name of no very uncertain signification but the name of mix modes which comprehend a great number of simple ideas be commonly of a very doubtful and undetermined mean as have be show the name of substances be annex to ideas that be neither the real essences nor exact representations of the pattern they be refer to be liable to yet greater imperfection and uncertainty especially when we come to a philosophical use of them why this imperfection charge upon word the great disorder that happen in our name of substances proceed for the most part from our want of knowledge and inability to penetrate into their real constitutions it may probably be wonder why i charge this as an imperfection rather upon our word than understand this exception have so much appearance of justice that i think myself oblige to give a reason why i have follow this method i must confess then that when i first begin this discourse of the understand and a good while after i have not the least think that any consideration of word be at all necessary to it but when have pass over the original and composition of our ideas i begin to examine the extent and certainty of our knowledge i find it have so near a connexion with word that unless their force and manner of signification be first well observe there could be very little say clearly and pertinently concern knowledge which be conversant about truth have constantly to do with proposition and though it terminate in things yet it be for the most part so much by the intervention of word that they seem scarce separable from our general knowledge at least they interpose themselves so much between our understand and the truth which it would contemplate and apprehend that like the medium through which visible object pass the obscurity and disorder do not seldom cast a mist before our eye and impose upon our understand if we consider in the fallacies men put upon themselves as well as others and the mistake in mens dispute and notions how great a part be owe to word and their uncertain or mistake significations we shall have reason to think this no small obstacle in the way to knowledge which i conclude we be the more carefully to be warn of because it have be so far from be take notice of as an inconvenience that the arts of improve it have be make the business of mens study and obtain the reputation of learn and subtilty as we shall see in the follow chapter but i be apt to imagine that be the imperfections of language as the instrument of knowledge more thoroughly weigh a great many of the controversies that make such a noise in the world would of themselves cease and the way to knowledge and perhaps peace too lie a great deal opener than it do this should teach us moderation in impose our own sense of old author sure i be that the signification of word in all languages depend very much on the thoughts notions and ideas of him that use them must unavoidably be of great uncertainty to men of the same language and country this be so evident in the greek author that he that shall peruse their write will find in almost every one of them a distinct language though the same word but when to this natural difficulty in every country there shall be add different countries and remote age wherein the speakers and writers have very different notions temper customs ornament and figure of speech c every one of which influence the signification of their word then though to us now they be lose and unknown it would become us to be charitable one to another in our interpretations or misunderstand of those ancient write which though of great concernment to be understand be liable to the unavoidable difficulties of speech which if we except the name of simple ideas and some very obvious things be not capable without a constant define the term of convey the sense and intention of the speaker without any manner of doubt and uncertainty to the hearer and in discourse of religion law and morality as they be matter of the highest concernment so there will be the greatest difficulty especially of the old and new testament scriptures the volumes of interpreters and commentators on the old and new testament be but too manifest proof of this though everything say in the text be infallibly true yet the reader may be nay can not choose but be very fallible in the understand of it nor be it to be wonder that the will of god when clothe in word should be liable to that doubt and uncertainty which unavoidably attend that sort of conveyance when even his son whilst clothe in flesh be subject to all the frailties and inconvenience of human nature sin except and we ought to magnify his goodness that he hath spread before all the world such legible character of his work and providence and give all mankind so sufficient a light of reason that they to whom this write word never come could not whenever they set themselves to search either doubt of the be of a god or of the obedience due to him since then the precepts of natural religion be plain and very intelligible to all mankind and seldom come to be controvert and other reveal truths which be convey to us by book and languages be liable to the common and natural obscurities and difficulties incident to word methinks it would become us to be more careful and diligent in observe the former and less magisterial positive and imperious in impose our own sense and interpretations of the latter of the abuse of word woeful abuse of word besides the imperfection that be naturally in language and the obscurity and confusion that be so hard to be avoid in the use of word there be several wilful fault and neglect which men be guilty of in this way of communication whereby they render these sign less clear and distinct in their signification than naturally they need to be word be often employ without any or without clear ideas first in this kind the first and most palpable abuse be the use of word without clear and distinct ideas or which be worse sign without anything signify of these there be two sort i some word introduce without clear ideas annex to them even in their first original one may observe in all languages certain word that if they be examine will be find in their first original and their appropriate use not to stand for any clear and distinct ideas these for the most part the several sects of philosophy and religion have introduce for their author or promoters either affect something singular and out of the way of common apprehensions or to support some strange opinions or cover some weakness of their hypothesis seldom fail to coin new word and such as when they come to be examine may justly be call insignificant term for have either have no determinate collection of ideas annex to them when they be first invent or at least such as if well examine will be find inconsistent it be no wonder if afterwards in the vulgar use of the same party they remain empty sound with little or no signification amongst those who think it enough to have them often in their mouth as the distinguish character of their church or school without much trouble their head to examine what be the precise ideas they stand for i shall not need here to heap up instance every man read and conversation will sufficiently furnish him or if he want to be better store the great mintmasters of this kind of term i mean the schoolmen and metaphysicians under which i think the dispute natural and moral philosophers of these latter age may be comprehend have wherewithal abundantly to content him ii other word to which ideas be annex at first use afterwards without distinct mean others there be who extend this abuse yet further who take so little care to lay by word which in their primary notation have scarce any clear and distinct ideas which they be annex to that by an unpardonable negligence they familiarly use word which the propriety of language have affix to very important ideas without any distinct mean at all wisdom glory grace c be word frequent enough in every man mouth but if a great many of those who use them should be ask what they mean by them they would be at a stand and not know what to answer a plain proof that though they have learn those sound and have them ready at their tongue end yet there be no determine ideas lay up in their mind which be to be express to others by them this occasion by men learn name before they have the ideas the name belong to men have be accustom from their cradle to learn word which be easily get and retain before they know or have frame the complex ideas to which they be annex or which be to be find in the things they be think to stand for they usually continue to do so all their live and without take the pain necessary to settle in their mind determine ideas they use their word for such unsteady and confuse notions as they have content themselves with the same word other people use as if their very sound necessarily carry with it constantly the same mean this though men make a shift with in the ordinary occurrences of life where they find it necessary to be understand and therefore they make sign till they be so yet this insignificancy in their word when they come to reason concern either their tenets or interest manifestly fill their discourse with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon especially in moral matter where the word for the most part stand for arbitrary and numerous collections of ideas not regularly and permanently unite in nature their bare sound be often only think on or at least very obscure and uncertain notions annex to them men take the word they find in use amongst their neighbor and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for use them confidently without much trouble their head about a certain fix mean whereby besides the ease of it they obtain this advantage that as in such discourse they seldom be in the right so they be as seldom to be convince that they be in the wrong it be all one to go about to draw those men out of their mistake who have no settle notions as to dispossess a vagrant of his habitation who have no settle abide this i guess to be so and every one may observe in himself and others whether it be so or not unsteady application of them secondly another great abuse of word be inconstancy in the use of them it be hard to find a discourse write on any subject especially of controversy wherein one shall not observe if he read with attention the same word and those commonly the most material in the discourse and upon which the argument turn use sometimes for one collection of simple ideas and sometimes for another which be a perfect abuse of language word be intend for sign of my ideas to make them know to others not by any natural signification but by a voluntary imposition it be plain cheat and abuse when i make them stand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another the wilful do whereof can be impute to nothing but great folly or greater dishonesty and a man in his account with another may with as much fairness make the character of number stand sometimes for one and sometimes for another collection of units vg this character stand sometimes for three sometimes for four and sometimes for eight as in his discourse or reason make the same word stand for different collections of simple ideas if men should do so in their reckon i wonder who would have to do with them one who would speak thus in the affairs and business of the world and call sometimes seven and sometimes nine as best serve his advantage would presently have clap upon him one of the two name men be commonly disgust with and yet in argue and learn contest the same sort of proceed pass commonly for wit and learn but to me it appear a greater dishonesty than the misplace of counter in the cast up a debt and the cheat the greater by how much truth be of greater concernment and value than money iii affect obscurity as in the peripatetick and other sects of philosophy thirdly another abuse of language be an affect obscurity by either apply old word to new and unusual significations or introduce new and ambiguous term without define either or else put them so together as may confound their ordinary mean though the peripatetick philosophy have be most eminent in this way yet other sects have not be wholly clear of it there be scarce any of them that be not cumber with some difficulties such be the imperfection of human knowledge which they have be fain to cover with obscurity of term and to confound the signification of word which like a mist before people eye might hinder their weak part from be discover that body and extension in common use stand for two distinct ideas be plain to any one that will but reflect a little for be their signification precisely the same it would be as proper and as intelligible to say the body of an extension as the extension of a body and yet there be those who find it necessary to confound their signification to this abuse and the mischiefs of confound the signification of word logic and the liberal sciences as they have be handle in the school have give reputation and the admire art of dispute hath add much to the natural imperfection of languages whilst it have be make use of and fit to perplex the signification of word more than to discover the knowledge and truth of things and he that will look into that sort of learn write will find the word there much more obscure uncertain and undetermined in their mean than they be in ordinary conversation logic and dispute have much contribute to this this be unavoidably to be so where mens part and learn be estimate by their skill in dispute and if reputation and reward shall attend these conquests which depend mostly on the fineness and niceties of word it be no wonder if the wit of man so employ should perplex involve and subtilize the signification of sound so as never to want something to say in oppose or defend any question the victory be adjudge not to him who have truth on his side but the last word in the dispute call it subtlety this though a very useless skin and that which i think the direct opposite to the ways of knowledge hath yet pass hitherto under the laudable and esteem name of subtlety and acuteness and have have the applause of the school and encouragement of one part of the learn men of the world and no wonder since the philosophers of old the dispute and wrangle philosophers i mean such as lucian wittily and with reason tax and the schoolmen since aim at glory and esteem for their great and universal knowledge easier a great deal to be pretend to than really acquire find this a good expedient to cover their ignorance with a curious and inexplicable web of perplex word and procure to themselves the admiration of others by unintelligible term the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understand whilst it appear in all history that these profound doctor be no wiser nor more useful than their neighbour and bring but small advantage to human life or the societies wherein they live unless the coin of new word where they produce no new things to apply them to or the perplex or obscure the signification of old ones and so bring all things into question and dispute be a thing profitable to the life of man or worthy commendation and reward this learn very little benefit society for notwithstanding these learn disputants these allknowing doctor it be to the unscholastic statesman that the governments of the world owe their peace defence and liberties and from the illiterate and contemn mechanic a name of disgrace that they receive the improvements of useful arts nevertheless this artificial ignorance and learn gibberish prevail mightily in these last age by the interest and artifice of those who find no easier way to that pitch of authority and dominion they have attain than by amuse the men of business and ignorant with hard word or employ the ingenious and idle in intricate dispute about unintelligible term and hold them perpetually entangle in that endless labyrinth besides there be no such way to gain admittance or give defence to strange and absurd doctrines as to guard them round about with legions of obscure doubtful and undefined word which yet make these retreat more like the dens of robbers or hole of fox than the fortresses of fair warriors which if it be hard to get them out of it be not for the strength that be in them but the briars and thorns and the obscurity of the thickets they be beset with for untruth be unacceptable to the mind of man there be no other defence leave for absurdity but obscurity but destroy the instrument of knowledge and communication thus learn ignorance and this art of keep even inquisitive men from true knowledge hath be propagate in the world and hath much perplex whilst it pretend to inform the understand for we see that other wellmeaning and wise men whose education and part have not acquire that acuteness could intelligibly express themselves to one another and in its plain use make a benefit of language but though unlearn men well enough understand the word white and black c and have constant notions of the ideas signify by those word yet there be philosophers find who have learn and subtlety enough to prove that snow be black ie to prove that white be black whereby they have the advantage to destroy the instrument and mean of discourse conversation instruction and society whilst with great art and subtlety they do no more but perplex and confound the signification of word and thereby render language less useful than the real defect of it have make it a gift which the illiterate have not attain to as useful as to confound the sound that the letter of the alphabet stand for these learn men do equally instruct mens understand and profit their live as he who should alter the signification of know character and by a subtle device of learn far surpass the capacity of the illiterate dull and vulgar should in his write show that he could put a for b and d for e c to the no small admiration and benefit of his reader it be as senseless to put black which be a word agree on to stand for one sensible idea to put it i say for another or the contrary idea ie to call snow black as to put this mark a which be a character agree on to stand for one modification of sound make by a certain motion of the organs of speech for b which be agree on to stand for another modification of sound make by another certain mode of the organs of speech this art have perplex religion and justice nor hath this mischief stop in logical niceties or curious empty speculations it hath invade the great concernments of human life and society obscure and perplex the material truths of law and divinity bring confusion disorder and uncertainty into the affairs of mankind and if not destroy yet in a great measure render useless these two great rule religion and justice what have the greatest part of the comment and dispute upon the laws of god and man serve for but to make the mean more doubtful and perplex the sense what have be the effect of those multiply curious distinctions and acute niceties but obscurity and uncertainty leave the word more unintelligible and the reader more at a loss how else come it to pass that princes speak or write to their servants in their ordinary command be easily understand speak to their people in their laws be not so and as i remark before doth it not often happen that a man of an ordinary capacity very well understand a text or a law that he read till he consult an expositor or go to counsel who by that time he hath do explain them make the word signify either nothing at all or what he please and ought not to pass for learn whether any byinterests of these professions have occasion this i will not here examine but i leave it to be consider whether it would not be well for mankind whose concernment it be to know things as they be and to do what they ought and not to spend their live in talk about them or toss word to and frowhether it would not be well i say that the use of word be make plain and direct and that language which be give us for the improvement of knowledge and bond of society should not be employ to darken truth and unsettle people right to raise mist and render unintelligible both morality and religion or that at least if this will happen it should not be think learn or knowledge to do so iv by take word for things fourthly another great abuse of word be the take them for things this though it in some degree concern all name in general yet more particularly affect those of substances to this abuse those men be most subject who most confine their thoughts to anyone system and give themselves up into a firm belief of the perfection of any receive hypothesis whereby they come to be persuade that the term of that sect be so suit to the nature of things that they perfectly correspond with their real existence who be there that have be breed up in the peripatetick philosophy who do not think the ten name under which be rank the ten predicaments to be exactly conformable to the nature of things who be there of that school that be not persuade that substantial form vegetative souls abhorrence of a vacuum intentional species c be something real these word men have learn from their very entrance upon knowledge and have find their master and systems lay great stress upon them and therefore they can not quit the opinion that they be conformable to nature and be the representations of something that really exist the platonists have their soul of the world and the epicureans their endeavour towards motion in their atoms when at rest there be scarce any sect in philosophy have not a distinct set of term that others understand not but yet this gibberish which in the weakness of human understand serve so well to palliate mens ignorance and cover their errors come by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe to seem the most important part of language and of all other the term the most significant and should aerial and aetherial vehicles come once by the prevalency of that doctrine to be generally receive anywhere no doubt those term would make impressions on mens mind so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such things as much as peripatetick form and intentional species have heretofore do instance in matter how much name take for things be apt to mislead the understand the attentive read of philosophical writers would abundantly discover and that perhaps in word little suspect of any such misuse i shall instance in one only and that a very familiar one how many intricate dispute have there be about matter as if there be some such thing really in nature distinct from body as it be evident the word matter stand for an idea distinct from the idea of body for if the ideas these two term stand for be precisely the same they might indifferently in all place be put for one another but we see that though it be proper to say there be one matter of all body one can not say there be one body of all matter we familiarly say one body be bigger than another but it sound harsh and i think be never use to say one matter be bigger than another whence come this then viz from hence that though matter and body be not really distinct but wherever there be the one there be the other yet matter and body stand for two different conceptions whereof the one be incomplete and but a part of the other for body stand for a solid extend figure substance whereof matter be but a partial and more confuse conception it seem to me to be use for the substance and solidity of body without take in its extension and figure and therefore it be that speak of matter we speak of it always as one because in truth it expressly contain nothing but the idea of a solid substance which be everywhere the same everywhere uniform this be our idea of matter we no more conceive or speak of different matter in the world than we do of different solidities though we both conceive and speak of different body because extension and figure be capable of variation but since solidity can not exist without extension and figure the take matter to be the name of something really exist under that precision have no doubt produce those obscure and unintelligible discourse and dispute which have fill the head and book of philosophers concern materia prima which imperfection or abuse how far it may concern a great many other general term i leave to be consider this i think i may at least say that we should have a great many fewer dispute in the world if word be take for what they be the sign of our ideas only and not for things themselves for when we argue about matter or any the like term we truly argue only about the idea we express by that sound whether that precise idea agree to anything really exist in nature or no and if men would tell what ideas they make their word stand for there could not be half that obscurity or wrangle in the search or support of truth that there be this make errors last but whatever inconvenience follow from this mistake of word this i be sure that by constant and familiar use they charm men into notions far remote from the truth of things it would be a hard matter to persuade any one that the word which his father or schoolmaster the parson of the parish or such a reverend doctor use signify nothing that really exist in nature which perhaps be none of the least cause that men be so hardly draw to quit their mistake even in opinions purely philosophical and where they have no other interest but truth for the word they have a long time be use to remain firm in their mind it be no wonder that the wrong notions annex to them should not be remove v by set them in the place of what they can not signify fifthly another abuse of word be the set them in the place of things which they do or can by no mean signify we may observe that in the general name of substances whereof the nominal essences be only know to us when we put them into proposition and affirm or deny anything about them we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend they should stand for the real essence of a certain sort of substances for when a man say gold be malleable he mean and would insinuate something more than this that what i call gold be malleable though truly it amount to no more but would have this understand viz that gold ie what have the real essence of gold be malleable which amount to thus much that malleableness depend on and be inseparable from the real essence of gold but a man not know wherein that real essence consist the connexion in his mind of malleableness be not truly with an essence he know not but only with the sound gold he put for it thus when we say that animal rationale be and animal implume bipes latis unguibus be not a good definition of a man it be plain we suppose the name man in this case to stand for the real essence of a species and would signify that a rational animal better describe that real essence than a twolegged animal with broad nail and without feather for else why might not plato as properly make the word anthropos or man stand for his complex idea make up of the idea of a body distinguish from others by a certain shape and other outward appearances as aristotle make the complex idea to which he give the name anthropos or man of body and the faculty of reason join together unless the name anthropos or man be suppose to stand for something else than what it signify and to be put in the place of some other thing than the idea a man profess he would express by it vg put them for the real essences of substances it be true the name of substances would be much more useful and proposition make in them much more certain be the real essences of substances the ideas in our mind which those word signify and it be for want of those real essences that our word convey so little knowledge or certainty in our discourse about them and therefore the mind to remove that imperfection as much as it can make them by a secret supposition to stand for a thing have that real essence as if thereby it make some nearer approach to it for though the word man or gold signify nothing truly but a complex idea of properties unite together in one sort of substances yet there be scarce anybody in the use of these word but often suppose each of those name to stand for a thing have the real essence on which these properties depend which be so far from diminish the imperfection of our word that by a plain abuse it add to it when we would make them stand for something which not be in our complex idea the name we use can no ways be the sign of hence we think change of our complex ideas of substances not to change their species this show us the reason why in mix modes any of the ideas that make the composition of the complex one be leave out or change it be allow to be another thing ie to be of another species as be plain in chancemedley manslaughter murder parricide c the reason whereof be because the complex idea signify by that name be the real as well as nominal essence and there be no secret reference of that name to any other essence but that but in substances it be not so for though in that call gold one put into his complex idea what another leave out and vice versa yet men do not usually think that therefore the species be change because they secretly in their mind refer that name and suppose it annex to a real immutable essence of a thing exist on which those properties depend he that add to his complex idea of gold that of fixedness and solubility in aqua regia which he put not in it before be not think to have change the species but only to have a more perfect idea by add another simple idea which be always in fact join with those other of which his former complex idea consist but this reference of the name to a thing whereof we have not the idea be so far from help at all that it only serve the more to involve us in difficulties for by this tacit reference to the real essence of that species of body the word gold which by stand for a more or less perfect collection of simple ideas serve to design that sort of body well enough in civil discourse come to have no signification at all be put for somewhat whereof we have no idea at all and so can signify nothing at all when the body itself be away for however it may be think all one yet if well consider it will be find a quite different thing to argue about gold in name and about a parcel in the body itself vg a piece of leafgold lay before us though in discourse we be fain to substitute the name for the thing the cause of this abuse a supposition of natures work always regularly in set boundaries to species that which i think very much dispose men to substitute their name for the real essences of species be the supposition before mention that nature work regularly in the production of things and set the boundaries to each of those species by give exactly the same real internal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general name whereas anyone who observe their different qualities can hardly doubt that many of the individuals call by the same name be in their internal constitution as different one from another as several of those which be rank under differ ent specific name this supposition however that the same precise and internal constitution go always with the same specific name make men forward to take those name for the representatives of those real essences though indeed they signify nothing but the complex ideas they have in their mind when they use them so that if i may so say signify one thing and be suppose for or put in the place of another they can not but in such a kind of use cause a great deal of uncertainty in mens discourse especially in those who have thoroughly imbibe the doctrine of substantial form whereby they firmly imagine the several species of things to be determine and distinguish this abuse contain two false suppositions but however preposterous and absurd it be to make our name stand for ideas we have not or which be all one essences that we know not it be in effect to make our word the sign of nothing yet it be evident to any one who ever so little reflect on the use men make of their word that there be nothing more familiar when a man ask whether this or that thing he see let it be a drill or a monstrous foetus be a man or no it be evident the question be not whether that particular thing agree to his complex idea express by the name man but whether it have in it the real essence of a species of things which he suppose his name man to stand for in which way of use the name of substances there be these false suppositions contain first that there be certain precise essences accord to which nature make all particular things and by which they be distinguish into species that everything have a real constitution whereby it be what it be and on which its sensible qualities depend be past doubt but i think it have be prove that this make not the distinction of species as we rank them nor the boundaries of their name secondly this tacitly also insinuate as if we have ideas of these propose essences for to what purpose else be it to inquire whether this or that thing have the real essence of the species man if we do not suppose that there be such a specific essence know which yet be utterly false and therefore such application of name as would make them stand for ideas which we have not must need cause great disorder in discourse and reason about them and be a great inconvenience in our communication by word vi by proceed upon the supposition that the word we use have a certain and evident signification which other men can not but understand sixthly there remain yet another more general though perhaps less observe abuse of word and that be that men have by a long and familiar use annex to them certain ideas they be apt to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the name and the signification they use them in that they forwardly suppose one can not but understand what their mean be and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the word deliver as if it be past doubt that in the use of those common receive sound the speaker and hearer have necessarily the same precise ideas whence presume that when they have in discourse use any term they have thereby as it be set before others the very thing they talk of and so likewise take the word of others as naturally stand for just what they themselves have be accustom to apply them to they never trouble themselves to explain their own or understand clearly others mean from whence commonly proceed noise and wrangle without improvement or information whilst men take word to be the constant regular mark of agree notions which in truth be no more but the voluntary and unsteady sign of their own ideas and yet men think it strange if in discourse or where it be often absolutely necessary in dispute one sometimes ask the mean of their term though the argue one may every day observe in conversation make it evident that there be few name of complex ideas which any two men use for the same just precise collection it be hard to name a word which be hard to name a word which will not be a clear instance of this life be a term none more familiar any one almost would take it for an affront to be ask what he mean by it and yet if it come in question whether a plant that lie ready form in the seed have life whether the embryo in an egg before incubation or a man in a swoon without sense or motion be alive or no it be easy to perceive that a clear distinct settle idea do not always accompany the use of so know a word as that of life be some gross and confuse conceptions men indeed ordinarily have to which they apply the common word of their language and such a loose use of their word serve them well enough in their ordinary discourse or affairs but this be not sufficient for philosophical inquiries knowledge and reason require precise determinate ideas and though men will not be so importunately dull as not to understand what others say without demand an explication of their term nor so troublesomely critical as to correct others in the use of the word they receive from them yet where truth and knowledge be concern in the case i know not what fault it can be to desire the explication of word whose sense seem dubious or why a man should be ashamed to own his ignorance in what sense another man use his word since he have no other way of certainly know it but by be inform this abuse of take word upon trust have nowhere spread so far nor with so ill effect as amongst men of letter the multiplication and obstinacy of dispute which have so lay waste the intellectual world be owe to nothing more than to this ill use of word for though it be generally believe that there be great diversity of opinions in the volumes and variety of controversies the world be distract with yet the most i can find that the contend learn men of different party do in their argue one with another be that they speak different languages for i be apt to imagine that when any of them quit term think upon things and know what they think they think all the same though perhaps what they would have be different the end of language first to convey our ideas to conclude this consideration of the imperfection and abuse of language the end of language in our discourse with others be chiefly these three first to make know one man thoughts or ideas to another secondly to do it with as much ease and quickness as possible and thirdly thereby to convey the knowledge of things language be either abuse of deficient when it fail of any of these three first word fail in the first of these end and lay not open one man ideas to anothers view when men have name in their mouth without any determinate ideas in their mind whereof they be the sign or when they apply the common receive name of any language to ideas to which the common use of that language do not apply them or when they apply them very unsteadily make them stand now for one and by and by for another idea to do it with quickness secondly men fail of convey their thoughts with all the quickness and ease that may be when they have complex ideas without have any distinct name for them this be sometimes the fault of the language itself which have not in it a sound yet apply to such a signification and sometimes the fault of the man who have not yet learn the name for that idea he would show another therewith to convey the knowledge of things thirdly there be no knowledge of things convey by mens word when their ideas agree not to the reality of things though it be a defect that have its original in our ideas which be not so conformable to the nature of things as attention study and application might make them yet it fail not to extend itself to our word too when we use them as sign of real be which yet never have any reality or existence how mens word fail in all these first when use without any ideas first he that hath word of any language without distinct ideas in his mind to which he apply them do so far as he use them in discourse only make a noise without any sense or signification and how learn soever he may seem by the use of hard word or learn term be not much more advance thereby in knowledge than he would be in learn who have nothing in his study but the bare title of book without possess the content of them for all such word however put into discourse accord to the right construction of grammatical rule or the harmony of wellturned periods do yet amount to nothing but bare sound and nothing else when complex ideas be without name annex to them secondly he that have complex ideas without particular name for them would be in no better case than a bookseller who have in his warehouse volumes that lay there unbind and without title which he could therefore make know to others only by show the loose sheet and communicate them only by tale this man be hinder in his discourse for want of word to communicate his complex ideas which he be therefore force to make know by an enumeration of the simple ones that compose them and so be fain often to use twenty word to express what another man signify in one when the same sign be not put for the same idea thirdly he that put not constantly the same sign for the same idea but use the same word sometimes in one and sometimes in another signification ought to pass in the school and conversation for as fair a man as he do in the market and exchange who sell several things under the same name when word be divert from their common use fourthly he that apply the word of any language to ideas different from those to which the common use of that country apply them however his own understand may be fill with truth and light will not by such word be able to convey much of it to others without define his term for however the sound be such as be familiarly know and easily enter the ears of those who be accustom to them yet stand for other ideas than those they usually be annex to and be wont to excite in the mind of the hearers they can not make know the thoughts of him who thus use them when they be name of fantastical imaginations fifthly he that imagine to himself substances such as never have be and fill his head with ideas which have not any correspondence with the real nature of things to which yet he give settle and define name may fill his discourse and perhaps another man head with the fantastical imaginations of his own brain but will be very far from advance thereby one jot in real and true knowledge summary he that hath name without ideas want mean in his word and speak only empty sound he that hath complex ideas without name for them want liberty and dispatch in his expressions and be necessitate to use periphrases he that use his word loosely and unsteadily will either be not mind or not understand he that apply his name to ideas different from their common use want propriety in his language and speak gibberish and he that hath the ideas of substances disagree with the real existence of things so far want the materials of true knowledge in his understand and hath instead thereof chimeras how mens word fail when they stand for substances in our notions concern substances we be liable to all the former inconvenience vg he that use the word tarantula without have any imagination or idea of what it stand for pronounce a good word but so long mean nothing at all by it he that in a newlydiscovered country shall see several sort of animals and vegetables unknown to him before may have as true ideas of them as of a horse or a stag but can speak of them only by a description till he shall either take the name the natives call them by or give them name himself he that use the word body sometimes for pure extension and sometimes for extension and solidity together will talk very fallaciously he that give the name horse to that idea which common usage call mule talk improperly and will not be understand he that think the name centaur stand for some real be impose on himself and mistake word for things how when they stand for modes and relations in modes and relations generally we be liable only to the four first of these inconvenience viz i may have in my memory the name of modes as gratitude or charity and yet not have any precise ideas annex in my thoughts to those name i may have ideas and not know the name that belong to them vg i may have the idea of a man drink till his colour and humour be alter till his tongue trip and his eye look red and his feet fail him and yet not know that it be to be call drunkenness i may have the ideas of virtues or vices and name also but apply them amiss vg when i apply the name frugality to that idea which others call and signify by this sound covetousness i may use any of those name with inconstancy but in modes and relations i can not have ideas disagree to the existence of things for modes be complex ideas make by the mind at plea sure and relation be but by way of consider or compare two things together and so also an idea of my own make these ideas can scarce be find to disagree with anything exist since they be not in the mind as the copy of things regularly make by nature nor as properties inseparably flow from the internal constitution or essence of any substance but as it be pattern lodge in my memory with name annex to them to denominate action and relations by as they come to exist but the mistake be commonly in my give a wrong name to my conceptions and so use word in a different sense from other people i be not understand but be think to have wrong ideas of them when i give wrong name to them only if i put in my ideas of mix modes or relations any inconsistent ideas together i fill my head also with chimeras since such ideas if well examine can not so much as exist in the mind much less any real be ever be denominate from them seventhly language be often abuse by figurative speech since wit and fancy find easier entertainment in the world than dry truth and real knowledge figurative speeches and allusion in language will hardly be admit as an imperfection or abuse of it i confess in discourse where we seek rather pleasure and delight than information and improvement such ornament as be borrow from them can scarce pass for fault but yet if we would speak of things as they be we must allow that all the art of rhetoric besides order and clearness all the artificial and figurative application of word eloquence hath invent be for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas move the passions and thereby mislead the judgment and so indeed be perfect cheat and therefore however laudable or allowable oratory may render them in harangue and popular address they be certainly in all discourse that pretend to inform or instruct wholly to be avoid and where truth and knowledge be concern can not but be think a great fault either of the language or person that make use of them what and how various they be will be superfluous here to take notice the book of rhetoric which abound in the world will instruct those who want to be inform only i can not but observe how little the pres ervation and improvement of truth and knowledge be the care and concern of mankind since the arts of fallacy be endow and prefer it be evident how much men love to deceive and be deceive since rhetoric that powerful instrument of error and deceit have its establish professors be publicly teach and have always be have in great reputation and i doubt not but it will be think great boldness if not brutality in me to have say thus much against it eloquence like the fair sex have too prevail beauties in it to suffer itself ever to be speak against and it be in vain to find fault with those arts of deceive wherein men find pleasure to be deceive of the remedy of the forego imperfections and abuse of word remedy be worth seek the natural and improve imperfections of languages we have see above at large and speech be the great bond that hold society together and the common conduit whereby the improvements of knowledge be convey from one man and one generation to another it would well deserve our most serious thoughts to consider what remedy be to be find for the inconvenience above mention be not easy to find i be not so vain as to think that any one can pretend to attempt the perfect reform the languages of the world no not so much as of his own country without render himself ridiculous to require that men should use their word constantly in the same sense and for none but determine and uniform ideas would be to think that all men should have the same notions and should talk of nothing but what they have clear and distinct ideas of which be not to be expect by any one who hath not vanity enough to imagine he can prevail with men to be very know or very silent and he must be very little skilled in the world who think that a voluble tongue shall accompany only a good understand or that mens talk much or little should hold proportion only to their knowledge but yet necessary to those who search after truth but though the market and exchange must be leave to their own ways of talk and gossip not be rob of their ancient privilege though the school and men of argument would perhaps take it amiss to have anything offer to abate the length or lessen the number of their dispute yet methinks those who pretend seriously to search after or maintain truth should think themselves oblige to study how they might deliver themselves without obscurity doubtfulness or equivocation to which mens word be naturally liable if care be not take misuse of word the great cause of errors for he that shall well consider the errors and obscurity the mistake and confusion that be spread in the world by an ill use of word will find some reason to doubt whether language as it have be employ have contribute more to the improvement or hindrance of knowledge amongst mankind how many be there that when they would think on things fix their thoughts only on word especially when they would apply their mind to moral matter and who then can wonder if the result of such contemplations and reason about little more than sound whilst the ideas they annex to them be very confuse and very unsteady or perhaps none at all who can wonder i say that such thoughts and reason end in nothing but obscurity and mistake without any clear judgment or knowledge have make men more conceited and obstinate this inconvenience in an ill use of word men suffer in their own private meditations but much more manifest be the disorder which follow from it in conversation discourse and argue with others for language be the great conduit whereby men convey their discoveries reason and knowledge from one to another he that make an ill use of it though he do not corrupt the fountains of knowledge which be in things themselves yet he do as much as in him lie break or stop the pip whereby it be distribute to the public use and advantage of mankind he that use word without any clear and steady mean what do he but lead himself and others into errors and he that designedly do it ought to be look on as an enemy to truth and knowl edge and yet who can wonder that all the sciences and part of knowledge have be so overcharge with obscure and equivocal term and insignificant and doubtful expressions capable to make the most attentive or quicksighted very little or not at all the more know or orthodox since subtlety in those who make profession to teach or defend truth hath pass so much for a virtue a virtue indeed which consist for the most part in nothing but the fallacious and illusory use of obscure or deceitful term be only fit to make men more conceited in their ignorance and more obstinate in their errors addict to wrangle about sound let us look into the book of controversy of any kind there we shall see that the effect of obscure unsteady or equivocal term be nothing but noise and wrangle about sound without convince or better a man understand for if the idea be not agree on betwixt the speaker and hearer for which the word stand the argument be not about things but name as often as such a word whose signification be not ascertain betwixt them come in use their understand have no other object wherein they agree but barely the sound the things that they think on at that time as express by that word be quite different instance bat and bird whether a bat be a bird or no be not a question whether a bat be another thing than indeed it be or have other qualities than indeed it have for that would be extremely absurd to doubt of but the question be either between those that acknowledge themselves to have but imperfect ideas of one or both of this sort of things for which these name be suppose to stand and then it be a real inquiry concern the nature of a bird or a bat to make their yet imperfect ideas of it more complete by examine whether all the simple ideas to which combine together they both give the name bird be all to be find in a bat but this be a question only of inquirers not disputers who neither affirm nor deny but examine or it be a question between disputants whereof the one affirm and the other deny that a bat be a bird and then the question be barely about the signification of one or both these word in that they not have both the same complex ideas to which they give these two name one hold and the other deny that these two name may be affirm one of another be they agree in the signification of these two name it be impossible they should dispute about them for they would presently and clearly see be that adjust between them whether all the simple ideas of the more general name bird be find in the complex idea of a bat or no and so there could be no doubt whether a bat be a bird or no and here i desire it may be consider and carefully examine whether the greatest part of the dispute in the world be not merely verbal and about the signification of word and whether if the term they be make in be define and reduce in their signification as they must be where they signify anything to determine collections of the simple ideas they do or should stand for those dispute would not end of themselves and immediately vanish i leave it then to be consider what the learn of disputation be and how well they be employ for the advantage of themselves or others whose business be only the vain ostentation of sound ie those who spend their live in dispute and controversies when i shall see any of those combatants strip all his term of ambiguity and obscurity which every one may do in the word he use himself i shall think him a champion for knowledge truth and peace and not the slave of vainglory ambition or a party remedy to remedy the defect of speech before mention to some degree and to prevent the inconvenience that follow from them i imagine the observation of these follow rule may be of use till somebody better able shall judge it worth his while to think more maturely on this matter and oblige the world with his thoughts on it first remedy to use no word without an idea annex to it first a man shall take care to use no word without a signification no name without an idea for which he make it stand this rule will not seem altogether needle to any one who shall take the pain to recollect how often he have meet with such word as instinct sym pathy and antipathy c in the discourse of others so make use of as he might easily conclude that those that use them have no ideas in their mind to which they apply them but speak them only as sound which usually serve instead of reason on the like occasion not but that these word and the like have very proper significations in which they may be use but there be no natural connexion between any word and any ideas these and any other may be learn by rote and pronounce or writ by men who have no ideas in their mind to which they have annex them and for which they make them stand which be necessary they should if men would speak intelligibly even to themselves alone second remedy to have distinct determinate ideas annex to word especially in mix modes secondly it be not enough a man use his word as sign of some ideas those he annex them to if they be simple must be clear and distinct if complex must be determinate ie the precise collection of simple ideas settle in the mind with that sound annex to it as the sign of that precise determine collection and no other this be very necessary in name of modes and especially moral word which have no settle object in nature from whence their ideas be take as from their original be apt to be very confuse justice be a word in every man mouth but most commonly with a very undertermined loose signification which will always be so unless a man have in his mind a distinct comprehension of the component part that complex idea consist of and if it be decompounded must be able to resolve it still on till he at last come to the simple ideas that make it up and unless this be do a man make an ill use of the word let it be justice for example or any other i do not say a man need stand to recollect and make this analysis at large every time the word justice come in his way but this at least be necessary that he have so examine the signification of that name and settle the idea of all its part in his mind that he can do it when he please if any one who make his complex idea of justice to be such a treatment of the person or goods of another as be accord to law hath not a clear and distinct idea what law be which make a part of his complex idea of justice it be plain his idea of justice itself will be confuse and imperfect this exactness will perhaps be judge very troublesome and therefore most men will think they may be excuse from settle the complex ideas of mix modes so precisely in their mind but yet i must say till this be do it must not be wonder that they have a great deal of obscurity and confusion in their own mind and a great deal of wrangle in their discourse with others and distinct and conformable ideas in word that stand for substances in the name of substances for a right use of them something more be require than barely determine ideas in these the name must also be conformable to things as they exist but of this i shall have occasion to speak more at large by and by this exactness be absolutely necessary in inquiries after philosophical knowledge and in controversies about truth and though it would be well too if it extend itself to common conversation and the ordinary affairs of life yet i think that be scarce to be expect vulgar notions suit vulgar discourse and both though confuse enough yet serve pretty well the market and the wake merchants and lovers cook and tailor have word wherewithal to dispatch their ordinary affairs and so i think might philosophers and disputants too if they have a mind to understand and to be clearly understand third remedy to apply word to such ideas as common use have annex them to thirdly it be not enough that men have ideas determine ideas for which they make these sign stand but they must also take care to apply their word as near as may be to such ideas as common use have annex them to for word especially of languages already frame be no man private possession but the common measure of commerce and communication it be not for any one at pleasure to change the stamp they be current in nor alter the ideas they be affix to or at least when there be a necessity to do so he be bind to give notice of it mens intentions in speak be or at least should be to be understand which can not be without frequent explanations demand and other the like incommodious interruptions where men do not follow common use propriety of speech be that which give our thoughts entrance into other mens mind with the greatest ease and advantage and therefore deserve some part of our care and study especially in the name of moral word the proper signification and use of term be best to be learn from those who in their write and discourse appear to have have the clearest notions and apply to them their term with the exactest choice and fitness this way of use a man word accord to the propriety of the language though it have not always the good fortune to be understand yet most commonly leave the blame of it on him who be so unskilful in the language he speak as not to understand it when make use of as it ought to be fourth remedy to declare the mean in which we use them fourthly but because common use have not so visibly annex any signification to word as to make men know always certainly what they precisely stand for and because men in the improvement of their knowledge come to have ideas different from the vulgar and ordinary receive ones for which they must either make new word which men seldom venture to do for fear of be though guilty of affectation or novelty or else must use old ones in a new signification therefore after the observation of the forego rule it be sometimes necessary for the ascertain the signification of word to declare their mean where either common use have leave it uncertain and loose as it have in most name of very complex ideas or where the term be very material in the discourse and that upon which it chiefly turn be liable to any doubtfulness or mistake and that in three ways as the ideas mens word stand for be of different sort so the way of make know the ideas they stand for when there be occasion be also different for though define be think the proper way to make know the proper signification of word yet there be some word that will not be define as there be others whose precise mean can not be make know but by definition and perhaps a third which partake somewhat of both the other as we shall see in the name of simple ideas modes and substances i in simple ideas either by synonymous term or by show examples first when a man make use of the name of any simple idea which he perceive be not understand or be in danger to be mistake he be oblige by the laws of ingenuity and the end of speech to declare his mean and make know what idea he make it stand for this as have be show can not be do by definition and therefore when a synonymous word fail to do it there be but one of these ways leave first sometimes the name the subject wherein that simple idea be to be find will make its name to be understand by those who be acquaint with that subject and know it by that name so to make a countryman understand what feuillemorte colour signify it may suffice to tell him it be the colour of wither leave fall in autumn secondly but the only sure way of make know the signification of the name of any simple idea be by present to his sense that subject which may produce it in his mind and make him actually have the idea that word stand for ii in mix modes by definition secondly mix modes especially those belong to morality be most of them such combinations of ideas as the mind put together of its own choice and whereof there be not always stand pattern to be find exist the signification of their name can not be make know as those of simple ideas by any show but in recompense thereof may be perfectly and exactly define for they be combinations of several ideas that the mind of man have arbitrarily put together without reference to any archetypes men may if they please exactly know the ideas that go to each composition and so both use these word in a certain and undoubted signification and perfectly declare when there be occasion what they stand for this if well consider would lay great blame on those who make not their discourse about moral things very clear and distinct for since the precise signification of the name of mix modes or which be all one the real essence of each species be to be know they be not of natures but man make it be a great negligence and perverseness to discourse of moral things with uncertainty and obscurity which be more pardonable in treat of natural substances where doubtful term be hardly to be avoid for a quite contrary reason as we shall see by and by morality capable of demonstration upon this grind it be that i be bold to think that morality be capable of demonstration as well as mathematics since the precise real essence of the things moral word stand for may be perfectly know and so the congruity and incongruity of the things themselves be certainly discover in which consist perfect knowledge nor let any one object that the name of substances be often to be make use of in morality as well as those of modes from which will arise obscurity for as to substances when concern in moral discourse their divers natures be not so much inquire into as suppose vg when we say that man be subject to law we mean nothing by man but a corporeal rational creature what the real essence or other qualities of that creature be in this case be no way consider and therefore whether a child or changeling be a man in a physical sense may amongst the naturalists be as disputable as it will it concern not at all the moral man as i may call him which be this immovable unchangeable idea a corporeal rational be for be there a monkey or any other creature to be find that have the use of reason to such a degree as to be able to understand general sign and to deduce consequences about general ideas he would no doubt be subject to law and in that sense be a man how much soever he differ in shape from others of that name the name of substances if they be use in them as they should can no more disturb moral than they do mathematical discourse where if the mathematician speak of a cube or globe of gold or of any other body he have his clear settle idea which vary not though it may by mistake be apply to a particular body to which it belong not definitions can make moral discourse clear this i have here mention by the by to show of what consequence it be for men in their name of mix modes and consequently in all their moral discourse to define their word when there be occasion since thereby moral knowledge may be bring to so great clearness and certainty and it must be great want of ingenuousness to say no worse of it to refuse to do it since a definition be the only way whereby the precise mean of moral word can be know and yet a way whereby their mean may be know certainly and without leave any room for any contest about it and therefore the negligence or perverseness of mankind can not be excuse if their discourse in morality be not much more clear than those in natural philosophy since they be about ideas in the mind which be none of them false or disproportionate they have no external be for the archetypes which they be refer to and must correspond with it be far easier for men to frame in their mind an idea which shall be the standard to which they will give the name justice with which pattern so make all action that agree shall pass under that denomination than have see aristides to frame an idea that shall in all things be exactly like him who be as he be let men make what idea they please of him for the one they need but know the combination of ideas that be put together in their own mind for the other they must inquire into the whole nature and abstruse hide constitution and various qualities of a thing exist without them and be the only way in which the mean of mix modes can be make know another reason that make the define of mix modes so necessary especially of moral word be what i mention a little before viz that it be the only way whereby the signification of the most of them can be know with certainty for the ideas they stand for be for the most part such whose component part nowhere exist together but scatter and mingle with others it be the mind alone that collect them and give them the union of one idea and it be only by word enumerate the several simple ideas which the mind have unite that we can make know to others what their name stand for the assistance of the sense in this case not help us by the proposal of sensible object to show the ideas which our name of this kind stand for as it do often in the name of sensible simple ideas and also to some degree in those of substances iii in substances both by show and by define thirdly for the explain the signification of the name of substances as they stand for the ideas we have of their distinct species both the forementioned ways viz of show and define be requisite in many case to be make use of for there be ordinarily in each sort some lead qualities to which we suppose the other ideas which make up our complex idea of that species annex we forwardly give the specific name to that thing wherein that characteristical mark be find which we take to be the most distinguish idea of that species these lead or characteristical as i may call them ideas in the sort of animals and vegetables be as have be before remark ch vi ss and ch ix ss mostly figure and in inanimate body colour and in some both together now ideas of the lead qualities of substances be best get by show these lead sensible qualities be those which make the chief ingredients of our specific ideas and consequently the most observable and invariable part in the definitions of our specific name as attribute to sort of substances come under our knowledge for though the sound man in its own nature be as apt to signify a complex idea make up of animality and rationality unite in the same subject as to signify any other combination yet use as a mark to stand for a sort of creatures we count of our own kind perhaps the outward shape be as necessary to be take into our complex idea signify by the word man as any other we find in it and therefore why platos animal implume bipes latis unguibus should not be a good definition of the name man stand for that sort of creatures will not be easy to show for it be the shape as the lead quality that seem more to determine that species than a faculty of reason which appear not at first and in some never and if this be not allow to be so i do not know how they can be excuse from murder who kill monstrous birth as we call them because of an unordinary shape without know whether they have a rational soul or no which can be no more discern in a wellformed than illshaped infant as soon as bear and who be it have inform us that a rational soul can inhabit no tenement unless it have just such a sort of frontispiece or can join itself to and inform no sort of body but one that be just of such an outward structure and can hardly be make know otherwise now these lead qualities be best make know by show and can hardly be make know otherwise for the shape of a horse or cassowary will be but rudely and imperfectly imprint on the mind by word the sight of the animals doth it a thousand time better and the idea of the particular colour of gold be not to be get by any description of it but only by the frequent exercise of the eye about it as be evident in those who be use to this metal who will frequently distinguish true from counterfeit pure from adulterate by the sight where others who have as good eye but yet by use have not get the precise nice idea of that peculiar yellow shall not perceive any difference the like may be say of those other simple ideas peculiar in their kind to any substance for which precise ideas there be no peculiar name the particular ring sound there be in gold distinct from the sound of other body have no particular name annex to it no more than the particular yellow that belong to that metal the ideas of the power of substances be best know by definition but because many of the simple ideas that make up our specific ideas of substances be power which lie not obvious to our sense in the things as they ordinarily appear therefore in the signification of our name of substances some part of the signification will be better make know by enumerate those simple ideas than by show the substance itself for he that to the yellow shin colour of gold get by sight shall from my enumerate them have the ideas of great ductility fusibility fixedness and solubility in aqua regia will have a perfecter idea of gold than he can have by see a piece of gold and thereby imprint in his mind only its obvious qualities but if the formal constitution of this shin heavy ductile thing from whence all these its properties flow lay open to our sense as the formal constitution or essence of a triangle do the signification of the word gold might as easily be ascertain as that of triangle a reflection on the knowledge of corporeal things possess by spirit separate from body hence we may take notice how much the foundation of all our knowl edge of corporeal things lie in our sense for how spirit separate from body whose knowledge and ideas of these things be certainly much more perfect than ours know them we have no notion no idea at all the whole extent of our knowledge or imagination reach not beyond our own ideas limit to our ways of perception though yet it be not to be doubt that spirit of a higher rank than those immerse in flesh may have as clear ideas of the radical constitution of substances as we have of a triangle and so perceive how all their properties and operations flow from thence but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceed our conceptions iv ideas of substances must be conformable to things fourthly but though definitions will serve to explain the name of substances as they stand for our ideas yet they leave them not without great imperfection as they stand for things for our name of substances be not put barely for our ideas but be make use of ultimately to represent things and so be put in their place their signification must agree with the truth of things as well as with mens ideas and therefore in substances we be not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly receive as the signification of that word but must go a little further and inquire into the nature and properties of the things themselves and thereby perfect as much as we can our ideas of their distinct species or else learn them from such as be use to that sort of things and be experience in them for since it be intend their name should stand for such collections of simple ideas as do really exist in things themselves as well as for the complex idea in other mens mind which in their ordinary acceptation they stand for therefore to define their name right natural history be to be inquire into and their properties be with care and examination to be find out for it be not enough for the avoid inconvenience in discourse and argue about natural body and substantial things to have learn from the propriety of the language the common but confuse or very imperfect idea to which each word be apply and to keep them to that idea in our use of them but we must by acquaint ourselves with the history of that sort of things rectify and settle our complex idea belong to each specific name and in discourse with others if we find them mistake us we ought to tell what the complex idea be that we make such a name stand for this be the more necessary to be do by all those who search after knowledge and philosophical verity in that children be teach word whilst they have but imperfect notions of things apply them at random and without much think and seldom frame determine ideas to be signify by them which custom it be easy and serve well enough for the ordinary affairs of life and conversation they be apt to continue when they be men and so begin at the wrong end learn word first and perfectly but make the notions to which they apply those word afterwards very overtly by this mean it come to pass that men speak the language of their country ie accord to grammar rule of that language do yet speak very improperly of things themselves and by their argue one with another make but small progress in the discoveries of useful truths and the knowledge of things as they be to be find in themselves and not in our imaginations and it matter not much for the improvement of our knowledge how they be call not easy to be make so it be therefore to be wish that men verse in physical inquiries and acquaint with the several sort of natural body would set down those simple ideas wherein they observe the individuals of each sort constantly to agree this would remedy a great deal of that confusion which come from several persons apply the same name to a collection of a smaller or greater number of sensible qualities proportionably as they have be more or less acquaint with or accurate in examine the qualities of any sort of things which come under one denomination but a dictionary of this sort contain as it be a natural history require too many hand as well as too much time cost pain and sagacity ever to be hop for and till that be do we must content ourselves with such definitions of the name of substances as explain the sense men use them in and it would be well where there be occasion if they would afford us so much this yet be not usually do but men talk to one another and dispute in word whose mean be not agree between them out of a mistake that the significations of common word be certainly establish and the precise ideas they stand for perfectly know and that it be a shame to be ignorant of them both which suppositions be false no name of complex ideas have so settle determine significations that they be constantly use for the same precise ideas nor be it a shame for a man not to have a certain knowledge of anything but by the necessary ways of attain it and so it be no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stand for in another man mind without he declare it to me by some other way than barely use that sound there be no other way without such a declaration certainly to know it indeed the necessity of communication by language bring men to an agreement in the signification of common word within some tolerable latitude that may serve for ordinary conversation and so a man can not be suppose wholly ignorant of the ideas which be annex to word by common use in a language familiar to him but common use be but a very uncertain rule which reduce itself at last to the ideas of particular men prove often but a very variable standard but though such a dictionary as i have above mention will require too much time cost and pain to be hop for in this age yet methinks it be not unreasonable to propose that word stand for things which be know and distinguish by their outward shape should be express by little draught and print make of them a vocabulary make after this fashion would perhaps with more ease and in less time teach the true signification of many term especially in languages of remote countries or age and settle truer ideas in mens mind of several things whereof we read the name in ancient author than all the large and laborious comment of learn critics naturalists that treat of plant and animals have find the benefit of this way and he that have have occasion to consult them will have reason to confess that he have a clearer idea of apium or ibex from a little print of that herb or beast than he could have from a long definition of the name of either of them and so no doubt he would have of strigil and sistrum if instead of currycomb and cymbal which be the english name dictionaries render them by he could see stamp in the margin small picture of these instrument as they be in use amongst the ancients toga tunica pallium be word easily translate by gown coat and cloak but we have thereby no more true ideas of the fashion of those habit amongst the romans than we have of the face of the tailor who make them such things as these which the eye distinguish by their shape would be best let into the mind by draught make of them and more determine the signification of such word than any other word set for them or make use of to define them but this be only by the bye v fifth remedy to use the same word constantly in the same sense fifthly if men will not be at the pain to declare the mean of their word and definitions of their term be not to be have yet this be the least that can be expect that in all discourse wherein one man pretend to instruct or convince another he should use the same word constantly in the same sense if this be do which nobody can refuse without great disingenuity many of the book extant might be spar many of the controversies in dispute would be at an end several of those great volumes swell with ambiguous word now use in one sense and by and by in another would shrink into a very narrow compass and many of the philosophers to mention no other as well as poets work might be contain in a nutshell when not so use the variation be to he explain but after all the provision of word be so scanty in respect to that infinite variety of thoughts that men want term to suit their precise notions will notwithstanding their utmost caution be force often to use the same word in somewhat different sense and though in the continuation of a discourse or the pursuit of an argument there can be hardly room to digress into a particular definition as often as a man vary the signification of any term yet the import of the discourse will for the most part if there be no design fallacy sufficiently lead candid and intelligent readers into the true mean of it but where there be not sufficient to guide the reader there it concern the writer to explain his mean and show in what sense he there use that term of knowledge and probability of knowledge in general our knowledge conversant about our ideas only since the mind in all its thoughts and reason hath no other immediate object but its own ideas which it alone do or can contemplate it be evident that our knowledge be only conversant about them knowledge be the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas knowledge then seem to me to be nothing but the perception of the connexion of and agreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas in this alone it consist where this perception be there be knowledge and where it be not there though we may fancy guess or believe yet we always come short of knowledge for when we know that white be not black what do we else but perceive that these two ideas do not agree when we possess ourselves with the utmost security of the demonstration that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones what do we more but perceive that equality to two right ones do necessarily agree to and be inseparable from the three angle of a triangle this agreement or disagreement may be any of four sort but to understand a little more distinctly wherein this agreement or disagreement consist i think we may reduce it all to these four sort i identity or diversity ii relation iii coexistence or necessary connexion iv real existence of identity or diversity in ideas first as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement viz identity or diversity it be the first act of the mind when it have any sentiments or ideas at all to perceive its ideas and so far as it perceive them to know each what it be and thereby also to perceive their difference and that one be not another this be so absolutely necessary that without it there could be no knowledge no reason no imagination no distinct thoughts at all by this the mind clearly and infallibly perceive each idea to agree with itself and to be what it be and all distinct ideas to disagree ie the one not to be the other and this it do without pain labour or deduction but at first view by its natural power of perception and distinction and though men of art have reduce this into those general rule what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be for ready application in all case wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it yet it be certain that the first exercise of this faculty be about particular ideas a man infallibly know as soon as ever he have them in his mind that the ideas he call white and round be the very ideas they be and that they be not other ideas which he call red or square nor can any maxim or proposition in the world make him know it clearer or surer than he do before and without any such general rule this then be the first agreement or disagreement which the mind perceive in its ideas which it always perceive at first sight and if there ever happen any doubt about it it will always be find to be about the name and not the ideas themselves whose identity and diversity will always be perceive as soon and clearly as the ideas themselves be nor can it possibly be otherwise of abstract relations between ideas secondly the next sort of agreement or disagreement the mind perceive in any of its ideas may i think be call relative and be nothing but the perception of the relation between any two ideas of what kind soever whether substances modes or any other for since all distinct ideas must eternally be know not to be the same and so be universally and constantly deny one of another there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all if we could not perceive any relation between our ideas and find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with another in several ways the mind take of compare them of their necessary coexistence in substances thirdly the third sort of agreement or disagreement to be find in our ideas which the perception of the mind be employ about be coexistence or noncoexistence in the same subject and this belong particularly to substances thus when we pronounce concern gold that it be fix our knowledge of this truth amount to no more but this that fixedness or a power to remain in the fire unconsumed be an idea that always accompany and be join with that particular sort of yellowness weight fusibility malleableness and solubility in aqua regia which make our complex idea signify by the word gold of real existence agree to any idea fourthly the fourth and last sort be that of actual real existence agree to any idea within these four sort of agreement or disagreement be i suppose contain all the knowledge we have or be capable of for all the inquiries we can make concern any of our ideas all that we know or can affirm concern any of them be that it be or be not the same with some other that it do or do not always coexist with some other idea in the same subject that it have this or that relation with some other idea or that it have a real existence without the mind thus blue be not yellow be of identity two triangles upon equal base between two parallel be equal be of relation iron be susceptible of magnetical impressions be of coexistence god be be of real existence though identity and coexistence be truly nothing but relations yet they be such peculiar ways of agreement or disagreement of our ideas that they deserve well to be consider as distinct head and not under relation in general since they be so different ground of affirmation and negation as will easily appear to any one who will but reflect on what be say in several place of this essay i should now proceed to examine the several degrees of our knowledge but that it be necessary first to consider the different acceptations of the word knowledge knowledge be either actual or habitual there be several ways wherein the mind be possess of truth each of which be call knowledge i there be actual knowledge which be the present view the mind have of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas or of the relation they have one to another ii a man be say to know any proposition which have be once lay before his thoughts he evidently perceive the agreement or disagreement of the ideas whereof it consist and so lodge it in his memory that whenever that proposition come again to be reflect on he without doubt or hesitation embrace the right side assent to and be certain of the truth of it this i think one may call habitual knowledge and thus a man may be say to know all those truths which be lodge in his memory by a forego clear and full perception whereof the mind be assure past doubt as often as it have occasion to reflect on them for our finite understand be able to think clearly and distinctly but on one thing at once if men have no knowledge of any more than what they actually think on they would all be very ignorant and he that know most would know but one truth that be all he be able to think on at one time habitual knowledge be of two degrees of habitual knowledge there be also vulgarly speak two degrees first the one be of such truths lay up in the memory as whenever they occur to the mind it actually perceive the relation be between those ideas and this be in all those truths whereof we have an intuitive knowledge where the ideas themselves by an immediate view discover their agreement or disagreement one with another secondly the other be of such truths whereof the mind have be convince it retain the memory of the conviction without the proof thus a man that remember certainly that he once perceive the demonstration that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones be certain that he know it because he can not doubt the truth of it in his adherence to a truth where the demonstration by which it be at first know be forget though a man may be think rather to believe his memory than really to know and this way of entertain a truth seem formerly to me like something between opinion and knowledge a sort of assurance which exceed bare belief for that rely on the testimony of anotheryet upon a due examination i find it come not short of perfect certainty and be in effect true knowledge that which be apt to mislead our first thoughts into a mistake in this matter be that the agreement or disagreement of the ideas in this case be not perceive as it be at first by an actual view of all the intermediate ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement of those in the proposition be at first perceive but by other intermediate ideas that show the agreement or disagreement of the ideas contain in the proposition whose certainty we remember for example in this proposition that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones one who have see and clearly perceive the demonstration of this truth know it to be true when that demonstration be go out of his mind so that at present it be not actually in view and possibly can not be recollect but he know it in a different way from what he do before the agreement of the two ideas join in that proposition be perceive but it be by the intervention of other ideas than those which at first produce that perception he remember ie he know for remembrance be but the revive of some past knowledge that he be once certain of the truth of this proposition that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones the immutability of the same relations between the same immutable things be now the idea that show him that if the three angle of a triangle be once equal to two right ones they will always be equal to two right ones and hence he come to be certain that what be once true in the case be always true what ideas once agree will always agree and consequently what he once know to be true he will always know to be true as long as he can remember that he once know it upon this grind it be that particular demonstrations in mathematics afford general knowledge if then the perception that the same ideas will eternally have the same habitudes and relations be not a sufficient grind of knowledge there could be no knowledge of general proposition in mathematics for no mathematical demonstration would be any other than particular and when a man have demonstrate any proposition concern one triangle or circle his knowledge would not reach beyond that particular diagram if he would extend it further he must renew his demonstration in another instance before he could know it to be true in another like triangle and so on by which mean one could never come to the knowledge of any general proposition nobody i think can deny that mr newton certainly know any proposition that he now at any time read in his book to be true though he have not in actual view that admirable chain of intermediate ideas whereby he at first discover it to be true such a memory as that able to retain such a train of particulars may be well think beyond the reach of human faculties when the very discovery perception and lay together that wonderful connexion of ideas be find to surpass most readers comprehension but yet it be evident the author himself know the proposition to be true remember he once saw the connexion of those ideas as certainly as he know such a man wound another remember that he saw him run him through but because the memory be not always so clear as actual perception and do in all men more or less decay in length of time this amongst other differences be one which show that demonstrative knowledge be much more imperfect than intuitive as we shall see in the follow chapter of the degrees of our knowledge of the degrees or differences in clearness of our knowledge intuitive all our knowledge consist as i have say in the view the mind have of its own ideas which be the utmost light and greatest certainty we with our faculties and in our way of knowledge be capable of it may not be amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence the different clearness of our knowledge seem to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind have of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas for if we will reflect on our own ways of think we will find that sometimes the mind perceive the agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately by themselves without the intervention of any other and this i think we may call intuitive knowledge for in this the mind be at no pain of prove or examine but perceive the truth as the eye doth light only by be direct towards it thus the mind perceive that white be not black that a circle be not a triangle that three be more than two and equal to one and two such kinds of truths the mind perceive at the first sight of the ideas together by bare intuition without the intervention of any other idea and this kind of knowledge be the clearest and most certain that human frailty be capable of this part of knowledge be irresistible and like bright sunshine force itself immediately to be perceive as soon as ever the mind turn its view that way and leave no room for hesitation doubt or examination but the mind be presently fill with the clear light of it it be on this intuition that depend all the certainty and evidence of all our knowledge which certainty every one find to be so great that he can not imagine and therefore not require a greater for a man can not conceive himself capable of a greater certainty than to know that any idea in his mind be such as he perceive it to be and that two ideas wherein he perceive a difference be different and not precisely the same he that demand a greater certainty than this demand he know not what and show only that he have a mind to be a sceptic without be able to be so certainty depend so wholly on this intuition that in the next degree of knowledge which i call demonstrative this intuition be necessary in all the connexions of the intermediate ideas without which we can not attain knowledge and certainty ii demonstrative the next degree of knowledge be where the mind perceive the agreement or disagreement of any ideas but not immediately though wherever the mind perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas there be certain knowledge yet it do not always happen that the mind see that agreement or disagreement which there be between them even where it be discoverable and in that case remain in ignorance and at most get no further than a probable conjecture the reason why the mind can not always perceive presently the agreement or disagreement of two ideas be because those ideas concern whose agreement or disagreement the inquiry be make can not by the mind be so put together as to show it in this case then when the mind can not so bring its ideas together as by their immediate comparison and as it be juxtaposition or application one to another to perceive their agreement or disagreement it be fain by the intervention of other ideas one or more as it happen to discover the agreement or disagreement which it search and this be that which we call reason thus the mind be will to know the agreement or disagreement in bigness between the three angle of a triangle and two right ones can not by an immediate view and compare them do it because the three angle of a triangle can not be bring at once and be compare with any other one or two angle and so of this the mind have no immediate no intuitive knowledge in this case the mind be fain to find out some other angle to which the three angle of a triangle have an equality and find those equal to two right ones come to know their equality to two right ones demonstration depend on clearly perceive proof those intervene ideas which serve to show the agreement of any two others be call proof and where the agreement and disagreement be by this mean plainly and clearly perceive it be call demonstration it be show to the understand and the mind make to see that it be so a quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate ideas that shall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other and to apply them right be i suppose that which be call sagacity as certain but not so easy and ready as intuitive knowledge this knowledge by intervene proof though it be certain yet the evidence of it be not altogether so clear and bright nor the assent so ready as in intuitive knowledge for though in demonstration the mind do at last perceive the agreement or disagreement of the ideas it consider yet it be not without pain and attention there must be more than one transient view to find it a steady application and pursuit be require to this discovery and there must be a progression by step and degrees before the mind can in this way arrive at certainty and come to perceive the agreement or repugnancy between two ideas that need proof and the use of reason to show it the demonstrate conclusion not without doubt precedent to the demonstration another difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge be that though in the latter all doubt be remove when by the intervention of the intermediate ideas the agreement or disagreement be perceive yet before the demonstration there be a doubt which in intuitive knowledge can not happen to the mind that have its faculty of perception leave to a degree capable of distinct ideas no more than it can be a doubt to the eye that can distinctly see white and black whether this ink and this paper be all of a colour if there be sight in the eye it will at first glimpse without hesitation perceive the word print on this paper different from the colour of the paper and so if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception it will perceive the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that produce intuitive knowledge if the eye have lose the faculty of see or the mind of perceive we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one or clearness of perception in the other not so clear as intuitive knowledge it be true the perception produce by demonstration be also very clear yet it be often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance that always accompany that which i call intuitive like a face reflect by several mirror one to another where as long as it retain the similitude and agreement with the object it produce a knowledge but it be still in every successive reflection with a lessen of that perfect clearness and distinctness which be in the first till at last after many remove it have a great mixture of dimness and be not at first sight so knowable especially to weak eye thus it be with knowledge make out by a long train of proof each step in demonstrate knowledge must have intuitive evidence now in every step reason make in demonstrative knowledge there be an intuitive knowledge of that agreement or disagreement it seek with the next intermediate idea which it use as a proof for if it be not so that yet would need a proof since without the perception of such agreement or disagreement there be no knowledge produce if it be perceive by itself it be intuitive knowledge if it can not be perceive by itself there be need of some intervene idea as a common measure to show their agreement or disagreement by which it be plain that every step in reason that produce knowledge have intuitive certainty which when the mind perceive there be no more require but to remember it to make the agreement or disagreement of the ideas concern which we inquire visible and certain so that to make anything a demonstration it be necessary to perceive the immediate agreement of the intervene ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement of the two ideas under examination whereof the one be always the first and the other the last in the account be find this intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step and progression of the demonstration must also be carry exactly in the mind and a man must be sure that no part be leave out which because in long deductions and the use of many proof the memory do not always so readily and exactly retain therefore it come to pass that this be more imperfect than intuitive knowledge and men embrace often falsehood for demonstrations hence the mistake ex praecognitis et praeconcessis the necessity of this intuitive knowledge in each step of scientifical or demonstrative reason give occasion i imagine to that mistake axiom that all reason be ex pracognitis et praeconcessis which how far it be a mistake i shall have occasion to show more at large when i come to consider proposition and particularly those proposition which be call maxims and to show that it be by a mistake that they be suppose to be the foundations of all our knowledge and reason demonstration not limit to ideas of mathematical quantity it have be generally take for grant that mathematics alone be capable of demonstrative certainty but to have such an agreement or disagreement as may intuitively be perceive be as i imagine not the privilege of the ideas of number extension and figure alone it may possibly be the want of due method and application in us and not of sufficient evidence in things that demonstration have be think to have so little to do in other part of knowledge and be scarce so much as aim at by any but mathematicians for whatever ideas we have wherein the mind can perceive the immediate agreement or disagreement that be between them there the mind be capable of intuitive knowledge and where it can perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by an intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement they have with any intermediate ideas there the mind be capable of demonstration which be not limit to ideas of extension figure number and their modes why it have be think to be so limit the reason why it have be generally seek for and suppose to be only in those i imagine have be not only the general usefulness of those sciences but because in compare their equality or excess the modes of number have every the least difference very clear and perceivable and though in extension every the least excess be not so perceptible yet the mind have find out ways to examine and discover demonstratively the just equality of two angle or extensions or figure and both these ie number and figure can be set down by visible and last mark wherein the ideas under consideration be perfectly determine which for the most part they be not where they be mark only by name and word modes of qualities not demonstrable like modes of quantity but in other simple ideas whose modes and differences be make and count by degrees and not quantity we have not so nice and accurate a distinction of their differences as to perceive or find ways to measure their just equality or the least differences for those other simple ideas be appearances of sensations produce in us by the size figure number and motion of minute corpuscles singly insensible their different degrees also depend upon the variation of some or of all those cause which since it can not be observe by us in particles of matter whereof each be too subtile to be perceive it be impossible for us to have any exact measure of the different degrees of these simple ideas for suppose the sensation or idea we name whiten be produce in us by a certain number of globules which have a verticity about their own centre strike upon the retina of the eye with a certain degree of rotation as well as progressive swiftness it will hence easily follow that the more the superficial part of any body be so order as to reflect the greater number of globules of light and to give them the proper rotation which be fit to produce this sensation of white in us the more white will that body appear that from an equal space send to the retina the greater number of such corpuscles with that peculiar sort of motion i do not say that the nature of light consist in very small round globules nor of whiten in such a texture of part as give a certain rotation to these globules when it reflect them for i be not now treat physically of light or colour but this i think i may say that i can not and i would be glad any one would make intelligible that he do conceive how body without us can any ways affect our sense but by the immediate contact of the sensible body themselves as in taste and feel or the impulse of some sensible particles come from them as in see hear and smell by the different impulse of which part cause by their different size figure and motion the variety of sensations be produce in us particles of light and simple ideas of colour whether then they be globules or no or whether they have a verticity about their own centre that produce the idea of whiten in us this be certain that the more particles of light be reflect from a body fit to give them that peculiar motion which produce the sensation of whiten in us and possibly too the quicker that peculiar motion isthe whiter do the body appear from which the greatest number be reflect as be evident in the same piece of paper put in the sunbeams in the shade and in a dark hole in each of which it will produce in us the idea of whiten in far different degrees the secondary qualities of things not discover by demonstration not know therefore what number of particles nor what motion of them be fit to produce any precise degree of whiten we can not demonstrate the certain equality of any two degrees of whiten because we have no certain standard to measure them by nor mean to distinguish every the least real difference the only help we have be from our sense which in this point fail us but where the difference be so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct ideas whose differences can be perfectly retain there these ideas or colour as we see in different kinds as blue and red be as capable of demonstration as ideas of number and extension what i have here say of whiten and colour i think hold true in all secondary qualities and their modes sensitive knowledge of the particular existence of finite be without us these two viz intuition and demonstration be the degrees of our knowledge whatever come short of one of these with what assurance soever embrace be but faith or opinion but not knowledge at least in all general truths there be indeed another perception of the mind employ about the particular existence of finite be without us which go beyond bare probability and yet not reach perfectly to either of the forego degrees of certainty pass under the name of knowledge there can be nothing more certain than that the idea we receive from an external object be in our mind this be intuitive knowledge but whether there be anything more than barely that idea in our mind whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of anything without us which correspond to that idea be that whereof some men think there may be a question make because men may have such ideas in their mind when no such thing exist no such object affect their sense but yet here i think we be provide with an evidence that put us past doubt for i ask any one whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different perception when he look on the sun by day and think on it by night when he actually taste wormwood or smell a rise or only think on that savour or odour we as plainly find the difference there be between any idea revive in our mind by our own memory and actually come into our mind by our sense as we do between any two distinct ideas if any one say a dream may do the same thing and all these ideas may be produce in us with out any external object he may please to dream that i make him this answer that it be no great matter whether i remove his scruple or no where all be but dream reason and arguments be of no use truth and knowledge nothing that i believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dream of be in the fire and be actually in it but yet if he be resolve to appear so sceptical as to maintain that what i call be actually in the fire be nothing but a dream and that we can not thereby certainly know that any such thing as fire actually exist without us i answer that we certainly find that pleasure or pain follow upon the application of certain object to us whose existence we perceive or dream that we perceive by our sense this certainty be as great as our happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment to know or to be so that i think we may add to the two former sort of knowledge this also of the existence of particular external object by that perception and consciousness we have of the actual entrance of ideas from them and allow these three degrees of knowledge viz intuitive demonstrative and sensitive in each of which there be different degrees and ways of evidence and certainty knowledge not always clear where the ideas that enter into it be clear but since our knowledge be found on and employ about our ideas only will it not follow from thence that it be conformable to our ideas and that where our ideas be clear and distinct or obscure and confuse our knowledge will be so too to which i answer no for our knowledge consist in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas its clearness or obscurity consist in the clearness or obscurity of that perception and not in the clearness or obscurity of the ideas themselves vg a man that have as clear ideas of the angle of a triangle and of equality to two right ones as any mathematician in the world may yet have but a very obscure perception of their agreement and so have but a very obscure knowledge of it but ideas which by reason of their obscurity or otherwise be confuse can not produce any clear or distinct knowledge because as far as any ideas be confuse so far the mind can not perceive clearly whether they agree or disagree or to express the same thing in a way less apt to be misunderstand he that hath not determine ideas to the word he use can not make proposition of them of whose truth he can be certain of the extent of human knowledge extent of our knowledge knowledge as have be say lie in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas it follow from hence that it extend no further than we have ideas first we can have knowledge no further than we have ideas it extend no further than we can perceive their agreement or disagreement secondly that we can have no knowledge further than we can have perception of that agreement or disagreement which perception be either by intuition or the immediate compare any two ideas or by reason examine the agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of some others or by sensation perceive the existence of particular things hence it also follow intuitive knowledge extend itself not to all the relations of all our ideas thirdly that we can not have an intuitive knowledge that shall extend itself to all our ideas and all that we would know about them because we can not examine and perceive all the relations they have one to another by juxtaposition or an immediate comparison one with another thus have the ideas of an obtuse and an acute angle triangle both draw from equal base and between parallel i can by intuitive knowledge perceive the one not to be the other but can not that way know whether they be equal or no because their agreement or disagreement in equality can never be perceive by an immediate compare them the difference of figure make their part incapable of an exact immediate application and therefore there be need of some intervene qualities to measure them by which be demonstration or rational knowledge nor do demonstrative knowledge fourthly it follow also from what be above observe that our ratio nal knowledge can not reach to the whole extent of our ideas because between two different ideas we would examine we can not always find such mediums as we can connect one to another with an intuitive knowledge in all the part of the deduction and wherever that fail we come short of knowledge and demonstration sensitive knowledge narrower than either fifthly sensitive knowledge reach no further than the existence of things actually present to our sense be yet much narrower than either of the former our knowledge therefore narrower than our ideas sixthly from all which it be evident that the extent of our knowledge come not only short of the reality of things but even of the extent of our own ideas though our knowledge be limit to our ideas and can not exceed them either in extent or perfection and though these be very narrow bound in respect of the extent of allbeing and far short of what we may justly imagine to be in some even create understand not tie down to the dull and narrow information that be to be receive from some few and not very acute ways of perception such as be our sense yet it would be well with us if our knowledge be but as large as our ideas and there be not many doubt and inquiries concern the ideas we have whereof we be not nor i believe ever shall be in this world resolve nevertheless i do not question but that human knowledge under the present circumstances of our be and constitutions may be carry much further than it have hitherto be if men would sincerely and with freedom of mind employ all that industry and labour of think in improve the mean of discover truth which they do for the colour or support of falsehood to maintain a system interest or party they be once engage in but yet after all i think i may without injury to human perfection be confident that our knowledge would never reach to all we might desire to know concern those ideas we have nor be able to surmount all the difficulties and resolve all the question that might arise concern any of them we have the ideas of a square a circle and equality and yet perhaps shall never be able to find a circle equal to a square and certainly know that it be so we have the ideas of matter and think but possibly shall never be able to know whether any mere material be think or no it be impossible for us by the contemplation of our own ideas without revelation to discover whether omnipotency have not give to some systems of matter fitly dispose a power to perceive and think or else join and fix to matter so dispose a think immaterial substance it be in respect of our notions not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that god can if he please superadd to matter a faculty of think than that he should superadd to it another substance with a faculty of think since we know not wherein think consist nor to what sort of substances the almighty have be please to give that power which can not be in any create be but merely by the good pleasure and bounty of the creator whether matter may not be make by god to think be more than man can know for i see no contradiction in it that the first eternal think be or omnipotent spirit should if he please give to certain systems of create senseless matter put together as he think fit some degrees of sense perception and think though as i think i have prove bk iv ch ss c it be no less than a contradiction to suppose matter which be evidently in its own nature void of sense and think should be that eternal firstthinking be what certainty of knowledge can any one have that some perceptions such as vg pleasure and pain should not be in some body themselves after a certain manner modify and move as well as that they should be in an immaterial substance upon the motion of the part of body body as far as we can conceive be able only to strike and affect body and motion accord to the utmost reach of our ideas be able to produce nothing but motion so that when we allow it to produce pleasure or pain or the idea of a colour or sound we be fain to quit our reason go beyond our ideas and attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of our maker for since we must allow he have annex effect to motion which we can no way conceive motion able to pro duce what reason have we to conclude that he could not order them as well to be produce in a subject we can not conceive capable of them as well as in a subject we can not conceive the motion of matter can any way operate upon i say not this that i would any way lessen the belief of the souls immateriality i be not here speak of probability but knowledge and i think not only that it become the modesty of philosophy not to pronounce magisterially where we want that evidence that can produce knowledge but also that it be of use to us to discern how far our knowledge do reach for the state we be at present in not be that of vision we must in many things content ourselves with faith and probability and in the present question about the immateriality of the soul if our faculties can not arrive at demonstrative certainty we need not think it strange all the great end of morality and religion be well enough secure without philosophical proof of the souls immateriality since it be evident that he who make us at the begin to subsist here sensible intelligent be and for several years continue us in such a state can and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another world and make us capable there to receive the retribution he have design to men accord to their do in this life and therefore it be not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other as some overzealous for or against the immateriality of the soul have be forward to make the world believe who either on the one side indulge too much their thoughts immerse altogether in matter can allow no existence to what be not material or who on the other side find not cogitation within the natural power of matter examine over and over again by the utmost intention of mind have the confidence to conclude that omnipotency itself can not give perception and think to a substance which have the modification of solidity he that consider how hardly sensation be in our thoughts reconcilable to extend matter or existence to anything that have no extension at all will confess that he be very far from certainly know what his soul be it be a point which seem to me to be put out of the reach of our knowledge and he who will give him self leave to consider freely and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the souls materiality since on which side soever he view it either as an unextended substance or as a think extend matter the difficulty to conceive either will whilst either alone be in his thoughts still drive him to the contrary side an unfair way which some men take with themselves who because of the inconceivableness of something they find in one throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis though altogether as unintelligible to an unbiassed understand this serve not only to show the weakness and the scantiness of our knowledge but the insignificant triumph of such sort of arguments which draw from our own view may satisfy us that we can find no certainty on one side of the question but do not at all thereby help us to truth by run into the opposite opinion which on examination will be find clog with equal difficulties for what safety what advantage to any one be it for the avoid the seem absurdities and to him unsurmountable rub he meet with in one opinion to take refuge in the contrary which be build on something altogether as inexplicable and as far remote from his comprehension it be past controversy that we have in us something that think our very doubt about what it be confirm the certainty of its be though we must content ourselves in the ignorance of what kind of be it be and it be in vain to go about to be sceptical in this as it be unreasonable in most other case to be positive against the be of anything because we can not comprehend its nature for i would fain know what substance exist that have not something in it which manifestly baffle our understand other spirit who see and know the nature and inward constitution of things how much must they exceed us in knowledge to which if we add larger comprehension which enable them at one glance to see the connexion and agreement of very many ideas and readily supply to them the intermediate proof which we by single and slow step and long pore in the dark hardly at last find out and be often ready to forget one before we have hunt out another we may guess at some part of the happiness of superior rank of spirit who have a quicker and more penetrate sight as well as a larger field of knowledge but to return to the argument in hand our knowledge i say be not only limit to the paucity and imperfections of the ideas we have and which we employ it about but even come short of that too but how far it reach let us now inquire how far our knowledge reach the affirmations or negations we make concern the ideas we have may as i have before intimate in general be reduce to these four sort viz identity coexistence relation and real existence i shall examine how far our knowledge extend in each of these our knowledge of identity and diversity in ideas extend as far as our ideas themselves first as to identity and diversity in this way of agreement or disagreement of our ideas our intuitive knowledge be as far extend as our ideas themselves and there can be no idea in the mind which it do not presently by an intuitive knowledge perceive to be what it be and to be different from any other of their coexistence extend only a very little way secondly as to the second sort which be the agreement or disagreement of our ideas in coexistence in this our knowledge be very short though in this consist the greatest and most material part of our knowledge concern substances for our ideas of the species of substances be as i have show nothing but certain collections of simple ideas unite in one subject and so coexist together vg our idea of flame be a body hot luminous and move upward of gold a body heavy to a certain degree yellow malleable and fusible for these or some such complex ideas as these in mens mind do these two name of the different substances flame and gold stand for when we would know anything further concern these or any other sort of substances what do we inquire but what other qualities or power these substances have or have not which be nothing else but to know what other simple ideas do or do not coexist with those that make up that complex idea because the connexion between simple ideas in substances be for the most part unknown this how weighty and considerable a part soever of human science be yet very narrow and scarce any at all the reason whereof be that the simple ideas whereof our complex ideas of substances be make up be for the most part such as carry with them in their own nature no visible necessary connexion or inconsistency with any other simple ideas whose coexistence with them we would inform ourselves about especially of the secondary qualities of body the ideas that our complex ones of substances be make up of and about which our knowledge concern substances be most employ be those of their secondary qualities which depend all as have be show upon the primary qualities of their minute and insensible part or if not upon them upon something yet more remote from our comprehension it be impossible we should know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another for not know the root they spring from not know what size figure and texture of part they be on which depend and from which result those qualities which make our complex idea of gold it be impossible we should know what other qualities result from or be incompatible with the same constitution of the insensible part of gold and so consequently must always coexist with that complex idea we have of it or else be inconsistent with it because necessary connexion between any secondary and the primary qualities be undiscoverable by us besides this ignorance of the primary qualities of the insensible part of body on which depend all their secondary qualities there be yet another and more incurable part of ignorance which set us more remote from a certain knowledge of the coexistence or incoexistence if i may so say of different ideas in the same subject and that be that there be no discoverable connexion between any secondary quality and those primary qualities which it depend on we have no perfect knowledge of their primary qualities that the size figure and motion of one body should cause a change in the size figure and motion of an other body be not beyond our conception the separation of the part of one body upon the intrusion of another and the change from rest to motion upon impulse these and the like seem to have some connexion one with another and if we know these primary qualities of body we might have reason to hope we might be able to know a great deal more of these operations of them one upon another but our mind not be able to discover any connexion betwixt these primary qualities of body and the sensations that be produce in us by them we can never be able to establish certain and undoubted rule of the consequence or coexistence of any secondary qualities though we could discover the size figure or motion of those invisible part which immediately produce them we be so far from know what figure size or motion of part produce a yellow colour a sweet taste or a sharp sound that we can by no mean conceive how any size figure or motion of any particles can possibly produce in us the idea of any colour taste or sound whatsoever there be no conceivable connexion between the one and the other and seek in vain for certain and universal knowledge of unperceived qualities in substances in vain therefore shall we endeavour to discover by our ideas the only true way of certain and universal knowledge what other ideas be to be find constantly join with that of our complex idea of any substance since we neither know the real constitution of the minute part on which their qualities do depend nor do we know them could we discover any necessary connexion between them and any of the secondary qualities which be necessary to be do before we can certainly know their necessary coexistence so that let our complex idea of any species of substances be what it will we can hardly from the simple ideas contain in it certainly determine the necessary coexistence of any other quality whatsoever our knowledge in all these inquiries reach very little further than our experience indeed some few of the primary qualities have a necessary dependence and visible connexion one with another as figure necessarily suppose extension receive or communicate motion by impulse suppose solidity but though these and perhaps some others of our ideas have yet there be so few of them that have a visible connexion one with another that we can by intuition or demonstration discover the coexistence of very few of the qualities that be to be find unite in substances and we be leave only to the assistance of our sense to make know to us what qualities they contain for of all the qualities that be coexistent in any subject without this dependence and evident connexion of their ideas one with another we can not know certainly any two to coexist any further than experience by our sense inform us thus though we see the yellow colour and upon trial find the weight malleableness fusibility and fixedness that be unite in a piece of gold yet because no one of these ideas have any evident dependence or necessary connexion with the other we can not certainly know that where any four of these be the fifth will be there also how highly probable soever it may be because the highest probability amount not to certainty without which there can be no true knowledge for this coexistence can be no further know than it be perceive and it can not be perceive but either in particular subject by the observation of our sense or in general by the necessary connexion of the ideas themselves of repugnancy to coexist our knowledge be larger as to the incompatibility or repugnancy to coexistence we may know that any subject may have of each sort of primary qualities but one particular at once vg each particular extension figure number of part motion exclude all other of each kind the like also be certain of all sensible ideas peculiar to each sense for whatever of each kind be present in any subject exclude all other of that sort vg no one subject can have two smell or two colour at the same time to this perhaps will be say have not an opal or the infusion of lignum nephriticum two colour at the same time to which i answer that these body to eye differently place may at the same time afford different colour but i take liberty also to say to eye differently place it be different part of the object that reflect the particles of light and therefore it be not the same part of the object and so not the very same subject which at the same time appear both yellow and azure for it be as impossible that the very same particle of any body should at the same time differently modify or reflect the ray of light as that it should have two different figure and textures at the same time our knowledge of the coexistence of power in body extend but a very little way but as to the power of substances to change the sensible qualities of other body which make a great part of our inquiries about them and be no inconsiderable branch of our knowledge i doubt as to these whether our knowledge reach much further than our experience or whether we can come to the discovery of most of these power and be certain that they be in any subject by the connexion with any of those ideas which to us make its essence because the active and passive power of body and their ways of operate consist in a texture and motion of part which we can not by any mean come to discover it be but in very few case we can be able to perceive their dependence on or repugnance to any of those ideas which make our complex one of that sort of things i have here instance in the corpuscularian hypothesis as that which be think to go furthest in an intelligible explication of those qualities of body and i fear the weakness of human understand be scarce able to substitute another which will afford us a fuller and clearer discovery of the necessary connexion and coexistence of the power which be to be observe unite in several sort of them this at least be certain that whichever hypothesis be clearest and truest for of that it be not my business to determine our knowledge concern corporeal substances will be very little advance by any of them till we be make to see what qualities and power of body have a necessary connexion or repugnancy one with another which in the present state of philosophy i think we know but to a very small degree and i doubt whether with those faculties we have we shall ever be able to carry our general knowledge i say not particular experience in this part much further experience be that which in this part we must depend on and it be to be wish that it be more improve we find the advantage some mens generous pain have this way bring to the stock of natural knowledge and if others especially the philosophers by fire who pretend to it have be so wary in their observations and sincere in their report as those who call themselves philosophers ought to have be our acquaintance with the body here about us and our insight into their power and operations have be yet much greater of the power that coexist in spirit yet narrower if we be at a loss in respect of the power and operations of body i think it be easy to conclude we be much more in the dark in reference to spirit whereof we naturally have no ideas but what we draw from that of our own by reflect on the operations of our own souls within us as far as they can come within our observation but how inconsiderable a rank the spirit that inhabit our body hold amongst those various and possibly innumerable kinds of nobler be and how far short they come of the endowments and perfections of cherubim and seraphim and infinite sort of spirit above us be what by a transient hint in another place i have offer to my readers consideration of relations between abstract ideas it be not easy to say how far our knowledge extend thirdly as to the third sort of our knowledge viz the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas in any other relation this as it be the largest field of our knowledge so it be hard to determine how far it may extend because the advance that be make in this part of knowledge depend on our sagacity in find intermediate ideas that may show the relations and habitudes of ideas whose coexistence be not consider it be a hard matter to tell when we be at an end of such discoveries and when reason have all the help it be capable of for the find of proof or examine the agreement or disagreement of remote ideas they that be ignorant of algebra can not imagine the wonder in this kind be to be do by it and what further improvements and help advantageous to other part of knowledge the sagacious mind of man may yet find out it be not easy to determine this at least i believe that the ideas of quantity be not those alone that be capable of demonstration and knowledge and that other and perhaps more useful part of contemplation would afford us certainty if vices passions and domineer interest do not oppose or menace such endeavour morality capable of demonstration the idea of a supreme be infinite in power goodness and wisdom whose workmanship we be and on whom we depend and the idea of ourselves as understand rational creatures be such as be clear in us would i suppose if duly consider and pursue afford such foundations of our duty and rule of action as might place morality amongst the sciences capable of demonstration wherein i doubt not but from selfevident proposition by necessary consequences as incontestible as those in mathematics the measure of right and wrong might be make out to any one that will apply himself with the same indifferency and attention to the one as he do to the other of these sciences the relation of other modes may certainly be perceive as well as those of number and extension and i can not see why they should not also be capable of demonstration if due methods be think on to examine or pursue their agreement or disagreement where there be no property there be no injustice be a proposition as certain as any demonstration in euclid for the idea of property be a right to anything and the idea to which the name injustice be give be the invasion or violation of that right it be evident that these ideas be thus establish and these name annex to them i can as certainly know this proposition to be true as that a triangle have three angle equal to two right ones again no government allow absolute liberty the idea of government be the establishment of society upon certain rule or laws which require conformity to them and the idea of absolute liberty be for any one to do whatever he please i be as capable of be certain of the truth of this proposition as of any in the mathematics two things have make moral ideas to be think incapable of demonstration their unfitness for sensible representation and their complexedness that which in this respect have give the advantage to the ideas of quantity and make them think more capable of certainty and demonstration be first that they can be set down and represent by sensible mark which have a greater and nearer correspondence with them than any word or sound whatsoever diagram draw on paper be copy of the ideas in the mind and not liable to the uncertainty that word carry in their signification an angle circle or square draw in line lie open to the view and can not be mistake it remain unchangeable and may at leisure be consider and examine and the demonstration be revise and all the part of it may be go over more than once without any danger of the least change in the ideas this can not be thus do in moral ideas we have no sensible mark that resemble them whereby we can set them down we have nothing but word to express them by which though when write they remain the same yet the ideas they stand for may change in the same man and it be very seldom that they be not different in different persons secondly another thing that make the greater difficulty in ethics be that moral ideas be commonly more complex than those of the figure ordinarily consider in mathematics from whence these two inconvenience followfirst that their name be of more uncertain signification the precise collection of simple ideas they stand for not be so easily agree on and so the sign that be use for them in communication always and in think often do not steadily carry with it the same idea upon which the same disorder confusion and error follow as would if a man go to demonstrate something of an heptagon should in the diagram he take to do it leave out one of the angle or by oversight make the figure with one angle more than the name ordinarily import or he intend it should when at first he think of his demonstration this often happen and be hardly avoidable in very complex moral ideas where the same name be retain one angle ie one simple idea be leave out or put in the complex one still call by the same name more at one time than another secondly from the complexedness of these moral ideas there follow another inconvenience viz that the mind can not easily retain those precise combinations so exactly and perfectly as be necessary in the examination of the habitudes and correspondences agreements or disagreements of several of them one with another especially where it be to be judge of by long deductions and the intervention of several other complex ideas to show the agreement or disagreement of two remote ones the great help against this which mathematicians find in diagram and figure which remain unalterable in their draught be very apparent and the memory would often have great difficulty otherwise to retain them so exactly whilst the mind go over the part of them step by step to examine their several correspondences and though in cast up a long sum either in addition multiplication or division every part be only a progression of the mind take a view of its own ideas and consider their agreement or disagreement and the resolution of the question be nothing but the result of the whole make up of such particulars whereof the mind have a clear perception yet without set down the several part by mark whose precise significations be know and by mark that last and remain in view when the memory have let them go it would be almost impossible to carry so many different ideas in the mind without confound or let slip some part of the reckon and thereby make all our reason about it useless in which case the cypher or mark help not the mind at all to perceive the agreement of any two or more number their equalities or proportion that the mind have only by intuition of its own ideas of the number themselves but the numerical character be help to the memory to record and retain the several ideas about which the demonstration be make whereby a man may know how far his intuitive knowledge in survey several of the particulars have proceed that so he may without confusion go on to what be yet unknown and at last have in one view before him the result of all his perceptions and reason remedy of our difficulties in deal demonstratively with moral ideas one part of these disadvantage in moral ideas which have make them be think not capable of demonstration may in a good measure be remedied by definitions set down that collection of simple ideas which every term shall stand for and then use the term steadily and constantly for that precise collection and what methods algebra or something of that kind may hereafter suggest to remove the other difficulties it be not easy to foretell confident i be that if men would in the same method and with the same indifferency search after moral as they do mathematical truths they would find them have a stronger connexion one with another and a more necessary consequence from our clear and distinct ideas and to come nearer perfect demonstration than be commonly imagine but much of this be not to be expect whilst the desire of esteem riches or power make men espouse the wellendowed opinions in fashion and then seek arguments either to make good their beauty or varnish over and cover their deformity nothing be so beautiful to the eye as truth be to the mind nothing so deform and irreconcilable to the understand as a lie for though many a man can with satisfaction enough own a no very handsome wife to in his bosom yet who be bold enough openly to avow that he have espouse a falsehood and receive into his breast so ugly a thing as a lie whilst the party of men cram their tenets down all mens throats whom they can get into their power without permit them to examine their truth or falsehood and will not let truth have fair play in the world nor men the liberty to search after it what improvements can be expect of this kind what greater light can be hop for in the moral sciences the subject part of mankind in most place might instead thereof with egyptian bondage expect egyptian darkness be not the candle of the lord set up by himself in mens mind which it be impossible for the breath or power of man wholly to extinguish of the three real existences of which we have certain knowledge fourthly as to the fourth sort of our knowledge viz of the real actual existence of things we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and a demonstrative knowledge of the existence of a god of the existence of anything else we have no other but a sensitive knowledge which extend not beyond the object present to our sense our ignorance great our knowledge be so narrow as i have show it will perhaps give us some light into the present state of our mind if we look a little into the dark side and take a view of our ignorance which be infinitely larger than our knowledge may serve much to the quiet of dispute and improvement of useful knowledge if discover how far we have clear and distinct ideas we confine our thoughts within the contemplation of those things that be within the reach of our understand and launch not out into that aby of darkness where we have not eye to see nor faculties to perceive anything out of a presumption that nothing be beyond our comprehension but to be satisfy of the folly of such a conceit we need not go far he that know anything know this in the first place that he need not seek long for instance of his ignorance the meanest and most obvious things that come in our way have dark side that the quickest sight can not penetrate into the clearest and most enlarge understand of think men find themselves puzzle and at a loss in every particle of matter we shall the less wonder to find it so when we consider the cause of our ignorance which from what have be say i suppose will be find to be these three its cause first want of ideas secondly want of a discoverable connexion between the ideas we have thirdly want of trace and examine our ideas one cause of our ignorance want of ideas first there be some things and those not a few that we be ignorant of for want of ideas i want of simple ideas that other creatures in other part of the universe may have first all the simple ideas we have be confine as i have show to those we receive from corporeal object by sensation and from the operations of our own mind as the object of reflection but how much these few and narrow inlets be disproportionate to the vast whole extent of all be will not be hard to persuade those who be not so foolish as to think their span the measure of all things what other simple ideas it be possible the creatures in other part of the universe may have by the assistance of sense and faculties more or perfecter than we have or different from ours it be not for us to determine but to say or think there be no such because we conceive nothing of them be no better an argument than if a blind man should be positive in it that there be no such thing as sight and colour because he have no manner of idea of any such thing nor could by any mean frame to himself any notions about see the ignorance and darkness that be in us no more hinder nor confine the knowledge that be in others than the blindness of a mole be an argument against the quicksightedness of an eagle he that will consider the infinite power wisdom and goodness of the creator of all things will find reason to think it be not all lay out upon so inconsiderable mean and impotent a creature as he will find man to be who in all probability be one of the lowest of all intellectual be what faculties therefore other species of creatures have to penetrate into the nature and inmost constitutions of things what ideas they may receive of them far different from ours we know not this we know and certainly find that we want several other view of them besides those we have to make discoveries of them more perfect and we may be convince that the ideas we can attain to by our faculties be very disproportionate to things themselves when a positive clear distinct one of substance itself which be the foundation of all the rest be conceal from us but want of ideas of this kind be a part as well as cause of our ignorance can not be describe only this i think i may confidently say of it that the intellectual and sensible world be in this perfectly alike that that part which we see of either of them hold no proportion with what we see not and whatsoever we can reach with our eye or our thoughts of either of them be but a point almost nothing in comparison of the rest want of simple ideas that men be capable of have but have not because of their remoteness secondly another great cause of ignorance be the want of ideas we be capable of as the want of ideas which our faculties be not able to give us shut us wholly from those view of things which it be reasonable to think other be perfecter than we have of which we know nothing so the want of ideas i now speak of keep us in ignorance of things we conceive capable of be know to us bulk figure and motion we have ideas of but though we be not without ideas of these primary qualities of body in general yet not know what be the particular bulk figure and motion of the greatest part of the body of the universe we be ignorant of the several power efficacies and ways of operation whereby the effect which we daily see be produce these be hide from us in some things by be too remote and in others by be too minute when we consider the vast distance of the know and visible part of the world and the reason we have to think that what lie within our ken be but a small part of the universe we shall then discover a huge aby of ignorance what be the particular fabrics of the great mass of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of corporeal be how far they be extend what be their motion and how continue or communicate and what influence they have one upon another be contemplations that at first glimpse our thoughts lose themselves in if we narrow our contemplations and confine our thoughts to this little cantoni mean this system of our sun and the grosser mass of matter that visibly move about it what several sort of vegetables animals and intellectual corporeal be infinitely different from those of our little spot of earth may there probably be in the other planets to the knowledge of which even of their outward figure and part we can no way attain whilst we be confine to this earth there be no natural mean either by sensation or reflection to convey their certain ideas into our mind they be out of the reach of those inlets of all our knowledge and what sort of furniture and inhabitants those mansions contain in them we can not so much as guess much less have clear and distinct ideas of them because of their minuteness if a great nay far the greatest part of the several rank of body in the universe escape our notice by their remoteness there be others that be no less conceal from us by their minuteness these insensible corpuscles be the active part of matter and the great instrument of nature on which depend not only all their secondary qualities but also most of their natural operations our want of precise distinct ideas of their primary qualities keep us in an incurable ignorance of what we desire to know about them i doubt not but if we could discover the figure size texture and motion of the minute constituent part of any two body we should know without trial several of their operations one upon another as we do now the properties of a square or a triangle do we know the mechanical affections of the particles of rhubarb hemlock opium and a man as a watchmaker do those of a watch whereby it perform its operations and of a file which by rub on them will alter the figure of any of the wheel we should be able to tell beforehand that rhubarb will purge hemlock kill and opium make a man sleep as well as a watchmaker can that a little piece of paper lay on the balance will keep the watch from go till it be remove or that some small part of it be rub by a file the machine would quite lose its motion and the watch go no more the dissolve of silver in aqua fortis and gold in aqua regia and not vice versa would be then perhaps no more difficult to know than it be to a smith to understand why the turn of one key will open a lock and not the turn of another but whilst we be destitute of sense acute enough to discover the minute particles of body and to give us ideas of their mechanical affections we must be content to be ignorant of their properties and ways of operation nor can we be assure about them any further than some few trials we make be able to reach but whether they will succeed again another time we can not be certain this hinder our certain knowledge of universal truths concern natural body and our reason carry us herein very little beyond particular matter of fact hence no science of body within our reach and therefore i be apt to doubt that how far soever human industry may advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical things scientifical will still be out of our reach because we want perfect and adequate ideas of those very body which be nearest to us and most under our command those which we have rank into class under name and we think ourselves best acquaint with we have but very imperfect and incomplete ideas of distinct ideas of the several sort of body that fall under the examination of our sense perhaps we may have but adequate ideas i suspect we have not of any one amongst them and though the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse yet whilst we want the latter we be not capable of scientifical knowledge nor shall ever be able to discover general instructive unquestionable truths concern them certainty and demonstration be things we must not in these matter pretend to by the colour figure taste and smell and other sensible qualities we have as clear and distinct ideas of sage and hemlock as we have of a circle and a triangle but have no ideas of the particular primary qualities of the minute part of either of these plant nor of other body which we would apply them to we can not tell what effect they will produce nor when we see those effect can we so much as guess much less know their manner of production thus have no ideas of the particular mechanical affections of the minute part of body that be within our view and reach we be ignorant of their constitutions power and operations and of body more remote we be yet more ignorant not know so much as their very outward shape or the sensible and grosser part of their constitutions much less a science of unembodied spirit this at first will show us how disproportionate our knowledge be to the whole extent even of material be to which if we add the consideration of that infinite number of spirit that may be and probably be which be yet more remote from our knowledge whereof we have no cognizance nor can frame to ourselves any distinct ideas of their several rank and sort we shall find this cause of ignorance conceal from us in an impenetrable obscurity almost the whole intellectual world a greater certainty and more beautiful world than the material for bat some very few and those if i may so call them superficial ideas of spirit which by reflection we get of our own and from thence the best we can collect of the father of all spirit the eternal independent author of them and us and all things we have no certain information so much as of the existence of other spirit but by revelation angels of all sort be naturally beyond our discovery and all those intelligences whereof it be likely there be more order than of corporeal substances be things whereof our natural faculties give us no certain account at all that there be mind and think be in other men as well as himself every man have a reason from their word and action to be satisfy and the knowledge of his own mind can not suffer a man that consider to be ignorant that there be a god but that there be degrees of spiritual be between us and the great god who be there that by his own search and ability can come to know much less have we distinct ideas of their different natures condition state power and several constitutions wherein they agree or differ from one another and from us and therefore in what concern their different species and properties we be in absolute ignorance another cause want of a discoverable connexion between ideas we have secondly what a small part of the substantial be that be in the universe the want of ideas leave open to our knowledge we have see in the next place another cause of ignorance of no less moment be a want of a discoverable connexion between those ideas we have for wherever we want that we be utterly incapable of universal and certain knowledge and be in the former case leave only to observation and experiment which how narrow and confine it be how far from general knowledge we need not be tell i shall give some few instance of this cause of our ignorance and so leave it it be evident that the bulk figure and motion of several body about us produce in us several sensations as of colour sound taste smell pleasure and pain c these mechanical affections of body have no affinity at all with those ideas they produce in us there be no conceivable connexion between any impulse of any sort of body and any perception of a colour or smell which we find in our mind we can have no distinct knowledge of such operations beyond our experience and can reason no otherwise about them than as effect produce by the appointment of an infinitely wise agent which perfectly surpass our comprehensions as the ideas of sensible secondary qualities which we have in our mind can by us be no way deduce from bodily cause nor any correspondence or connexion be find between them and those primary qualities which experience show us produce them in us so on the other side the operation of our mind upon our body be as inconceivable how any think should produce a motion in body be as remote from the nature of our ideas as how any body should produce any think in the mind that it be so if experience do not convince us the consideration of the things themselves would never be able in the least to discover to us these and the like though they have a constant and regular connexion in the ordinary course of things yet that connexion be not discoverable in the ideas themselves which appear to have no necessary dependence one on another we can attribute their connexion to nothing else but the arbitrary determination of that allwise agent who have make them to be and to operate as they do in a way wholly above our weak understand to conceive instance in some of our ideas there be certain relations habitudes and connexions so visibly include in the nature of the ideas themselves that we can not conceive them separable from them by any power whatsoever and in these only we be capable of certain and universal knowledge thus the idea of a rightlined triangle necessarily carry with it an equality of its angle to two right ones nor can we conceive this relation this connexion of these two ideas to be possibly mutable or to depend on any arbitrary power which of choice make it thus or could make it otherwise but the coherence and continuity of the part of matter the production of sensation in us of colour and sound c by impulse and motion nay the original rule and communication of motion be such wherein we can discover no natural connexion with any ideas we have we can not but ascribe them to the arbitrary will and good pleasure of the wise architect i need not i think here mention the resurrection of the dead the future state of this globe of earth and such other things which be by every one acknowledge to depend wholly on the determination of a free agent the things that as far as our observation reach we constantly find to proceed regularly we may conclude do act by a law set them but yet by a law that we know not whereby though cause work steadily and effect constantly flow from them yet their connexions and dependencies be not discoverable in our ideas we can have but an experimental knowledge of them from all which it be easy to perceive what a darkness we be involve in how little it be of be and the things that be that we be capable to know and therefore we shall do no injury to our knowledge when we modestly think with ourselves that we be so far from be able to comprehend the whole nature of the universe and all the things contain in it that we be not capable of a philosophical knowledge of the body that be about us and make a part of us concern their secondary qualities power and operations we can have no universal certainty several effect come every day within the notice of our sense of which we have so far sensitive knowledge but the cause manner and certainty of their production for the two forego reason we must be content to be very ignorant of in these we can go no further than particular experience inform us matter of fact and by analogy to guess what effect the like body be upon other trials like to produce but as to a perfect science of natural body not to mention spiritual be we be i think so far from be capable of any such thing that i conclude it lose labour to seek after it a third cause want of trace our ideas thirdly where we have adequate ideas and where there be a certain and discoverable connexion between them yet we be often ignorant for want of trace those ideas which we have or may have and for want of find out those intermediate ideas which may show us what habitude of agreement or disagreement they have one with another and thus many be ignorant of mathematical truths not out of any imperfection of their faculties or uncertainty in the things themselves but for want of application in acquire examine and by due ways compare those ideas that which have most contribute to hinder the due trace of our ideas and find out their relations and agreements or disagreements one with another have be i suppose the ill use of word it be impossible that men should ever truly seek or certainly discover the agreement or disagreement of ideas themselves whilst their thoughts flutter about or stick only in sound of doubtful and uncertain significations mathematicians abstract their thoughts from name and accustom themselves to set before their mind the ideas themselves that they would consider and not sound instead of them have avoid thereby a great part of that perplexity puddering and confusion which have so much hinder mens progress in other part of knowledge for whilst they stick in word of undetermined and uncertain signification they be unable to distinguish true from false certain from probable consistent from inconsistent in their own opinions this have be the fate or misfortune of a great part of men of letter the increase bring into the stock of real knowledge have be very little in proportion to the school dispute and write the world have be fill with whilst students be lose in the great wood of word know not whereabouts they be how far their discoveries be advance or what be want in their own or the general stock of knowledge have men in the discoveries of the material do as they have in those of the intellectual world involve all in the obscurity of uncertain and doubtful ways of talk volumes writ of navigation and voyage theories and stories of zone and tide multiply and dispute nay ship build and fleet send out would never have teach us the way beyond the line and the antipodes would be still as much unknown as when it be declare heresy to hold there be any but have speak sufficiently of word and the ill or careless use that be commonly make of them i shall not say anything more of it here extent of human knowledge in respect to its universality hitherto we have examine the extent of our knowledge in respect of the several sort of be that be there be another extent of it in respect of universality which will also deserve to be consider and in this regard our knowledge follow the nature of our ideas if the ideas be abstract whose agreement or disagreement we perceive our knowledge be universal for what be know of such general ideas will be true of every particular thing in whom that essence ie that abstract idea be to be find and what be once know of such ideas will be perpetually and for ever true so that as to all general knowledge we must search and find it only in our mind and it be only the examine of our own ideas that furnisheth us with that truths belong to essences of things that be to abstract ideas be eternal and be to be find out by the contemplation only of those essences as the existence of things be to be know only from experience but have more to say of this in the chapters where i shall speak of general and real knowledge this may here suffice as to the universality of our knowledge in general of the reality of knowledge objection knowledge place in our ideas may be all unreal or chimerical i doubt not but my reader by this time may be apt to think that i have be all this while only build a castle in the air and be ready to say to me to what purpose all this stir knowledge say you be only the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas but who know what those ideas may be be there anything so extravagant as the imaginations of mens brain where be the head that have no chimeras in it or if there be a sober and a wise man what difference will there be by your rule between his knowledge and that of the most extravagant fancy in the world they both have their ideas and perceive their agreement and disagreement one with another if there be any difference between them the advantage will be on the warmheaded man side as have the more ideas and the more lively and so by your rule he will be the more know if it be true that all knowledge lie only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas the visions of an enthusiast and the reason of a sober man will be equally certain it be no matter how things be so a man observe but the agreement of his own imaginations and talk conformably it be all truth all certainty such castle in the air will be as strongholds of truth as the demonstrations of euclid that an harpy be not a centaur be by this way as certain knowledge and as much a truth as that a square be not a circle but of what use be all this fine knowledge of mens own imaginations to a man that inquire after the reality of things it matter not what mens fancy be it be the knowledge of things that be only to be prize it be this alone give a value to our reason and preference to one man knowledge over anothers that it be of things as they really be and not of dream and fancy answer not so where ideas agree with things to which i answer that if our knowledge of our ideas terminate in them and reach no further where there be something further intend our most serious thoughts will be of little more use than the reveries of a crazy brain and the truths build thereon of no more weight than the discourse of a man who see things clearly in a dream and with great assurance utter them but i hope before i have do to make it evident that this way of certainty by the knowledge of our own ideas go a little further than bare imagination and i believe it will appear that all the certainty of general truths a man have lie in nothing else but what shall be the criterion of this agreement it be evident the mind know not things immediately but only by the intervention of the ideas it have of them our knowledge therefore be real only so far as there be a conformity between our ideas and the reality of things but what shall be here the criterion how shall the mind when it perceive nothing but its own ideas know that they agree with things themselves this though it seem not to want difficulty yet i think there be two sort of ideas that we may be assure agree with things as all simple ideas be really conform to things first the first be simple ideas which since the mind as have be show can by no mean make to itself must necessarily be the product of things operate on the mind in a natural way and produce therein those perceptions which by the wisdom and will of our maker they be ordain and adapt to from whence it follow that simple ideas be not fictions of our fancy but the natural and regular productions of things without us really operate upon us and so carry with them all the conformity which be intend or which our state require for they represent to us things under those appearances which they be fit to produce in us whereby we be enable to distinguish the sort of particular substances to discern the state they be in and so to take them for our necessities and apply them to our use thus the idea of whiten or bitterness as it be in the mind exactly answer that power which be in any body to produce it there have all the real conformity it can or ought to have with things without us and this conformity between our simple ideas and the existence of things be sufficient for real knowledge all complex ideas except ideas of substances be their own archetypes secondly all our complex ideas except those of substances be archetypes of the mind own make not intend to be the copy of anything nor refer to the existence of anything as to their originals can not want any conformity necessary to real knowledge for that which be not design to represent anything but itself can never be capable of a wrong representation nor mislead us from the true apprehension of anything by its dislikeness to it and such except those of substances be all our complex ideas which as i have show in another place be combinations of ideas which the mind by its free choice put together without consider any connexion they have in nature and hence it be that in all these sort the ideas themselves be consider as the archetypes and things no otherwise regard but as they be conformable to them so that we can not but be infallibly certain that all the knowledge we attain concern these ideas be real and reach things themselves because in all our thoughts reason and discourse of this kind we intend things no further than as they be conformable to our ideas so that in these we can not miss of a certain and undoubted reality hence the reality of mathematical knowledge i doubt not but it will be easily grant that the knowledge we have of mathematical truths be not only certain but real knowledge and not the bare empty vision of vain insignificant chimeras of the brain and yet if we will consider we shall find that it be only of our own ideas the mathematician consider the truth and properties belong to a rectangle or circle only as they be in idea in his own mind for it be possible he never find either of them exist mathematically ie precisely true in his life but yet the knowledge he have of any truths or properties belong to a circle or any other mathematical figure be nevertheless true and certain even of real things exist because real things be no further concern nor intend to be mean by any such proposition than as things really agree to those archetypes in his mind be it true of the idea of a triangle that its three angle be equal to two right ones it be true also of a triangle wherever it really exist whatever other figure exist that it be not exactly answerable to that idea of a triangle in his mind be not at all concern in that proposition and therefore he be certain all his knowledge concern such ideas be real knowledge because intend things no further than they agree with those his ideas he be sure what he know concern those figure when they have barely an ideal existence in his mind will hold true of them also when they have a real existence in matter his consideration be barely of those figure which be the same wherever or however they exist and of moral and hence it follow that moral knowledge be as capable of real certainty as mathematics for certainty be but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas and demonstration nothing but the perception of such agreement by the intervention of other ideas or mediums our moral ideas as well as mathematical be archetypes themselves and so adequate and complete ideas all the agreement or disagreement which we shall find in them will produce real knowledge as well as in mathematical figure existence not require to make abstract knowledge real for the attain of knowledge and certainty it be requisite that we have determine ideas and to make our knowledge real it be requisite that the ideas answer their archetypes nor let it be wonder that i place the certainty of our knowledge in the consideration of our ideas with so little care and regard as it may seem to the real existence of things since most of those discourse which take up the thoughts and engage the dispute of those who pretend to make it their business to inquire after truth and certainty will i presume upon examination be find to be general proposition and notions in which existence be not at all concern all the discourse of the mathematicians about the square of a circle conic section or any other part of mathematics concern not the existence of any of those figure but their demonstrations which depend on their ideas be the same whether there be any square or circle exist in the world or no in the same manner the truth and certainty of moral discourse abstract from the live of men and the existence of those virtues in the world whereof they treat nor be tullys offices less true because there be nobody in the world that exactly practise his rule and live up to that pattern of a virtuous man which he have give us and which exist nowhere when he writ but in idea if it be true in speculation ie in idea that murder deserve death it will also be true in reality of any action that exist conformable to that idea of murder as for other action the truth of that proposition concern them not and thus it be of all other species of things which have no other essences but those ideas which be in the mind of men nor will it be less true or certain because moral ideas be of our own make and name but it will here be say that if moral knowledge be place in the contemplation of our own moral ideas and those as other modes be of our own make what strange notions will there be of justice and temperance what confusion of virtues and vice if every one may make what ideas of them he please no confusion or disorder in the things themselves nor the reason about them no more than in mathematics there would be a disturbance in the demonstration or a change in the properties of figure and their relations one to another if a man should make a triangle with four corner or a trapezium with four right angle that be in plain english change the name of the figure and call that by one name which mathematicians call ordinarily by another for let a man make to himself the idea of a figure with three angle whereof one be a right one and call it if he please equilaterum or trapezium or anything else the properties of and demonstrations about that idea will be the same as if he call it a rectangular triangle i confess the change of the name by the impropriety of speech will at first disturb him who know not what idea it stand for but as soon as the figure be draw the consequences and demonstrations be plain and clear just the same be it in moral knowledge let a man have the idea of take from others without their consent what their honest industry have possess them of and call this justice if he please he that take the name here without the idea put to it will be mistake by join another idea of his own to that name but strip the idea of that name or take it such as it be in the speakers mind and the same things will agree to it as if you call it injustice indeed wrong name in moral discourse breed usually more disorder because they be not so easily rectify as in mathematics where the figure once draw and see make the name useless and of no force for what need of a sign when the thing signify be present and in view but in moral name that can not be so easily and shortly do because of the many decompositions that go to the make up the complex ideas of those modes but yet for all this the miscall of any of those ideas contrary to the usual signification of the word of that language hinder not but that we may have certain and demonstrative knowledge of their several agreements and disagreements if we will carefully as in mathematics keep to the same precise ideas and trace them in their several relations one to another without be lead away by their name if we but separate the idea under consideration from the sign that stand for it our knowledge go equally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty whatever sound we make use of misname disturb not the certainty of the knowledge one thing more we be to take notice of that where god or any other lawmaker hath define any moral name there they have make the essence of that species to which that name belong and there it be not safe to apply or use them otherwise but in other case it be bare impropriety of speech to apply them contrary to the common usage of the country but yet even this too disturb not the certainty of that knowledge which be still to be have by a due contemplation and compare of those even nickname ideas our complex ideas of substances have their archetypes without us and here knowledge come short thirdly there be another sort of complex ideas which be refer to archetypes without us may differ from them and so our knowledge about them may come short of be real such be our ideas of substances which consist of a collection of simple ideas suppose take from the work of nature may yet vary from them by have more or different ideas unite in them than be to be find unite in the things themselves from whence it come to pass that they may and often do fail of be exactly conformable to things themselves so far as our complex ideas agree with those archetypes without us so far our knowledge concern substances be real i say then that to have ideas of substances which by be conformable to things may afford us real knowledge it be not enough as in modes to put together such ideas as have no inconsistence though they do never before so exist vg the ideas of sacrilege or perjury c be as real and true ideas before as after the existence of any such fact but our ideas of substances be suppose copy and refer to archetypes without us must still be take from something that do or have exist they must not consist of ideas put together at the pleasure of our thoughts without any real pattern they be take from though we can perceive no inconsistence in such a combination the reason whereof be because we know not what real constitution it be of substances whereon our simple ideas depend and which really be the cause of the strict union of some of them one with another and the exclusion of others there be very few of them that we can be sure be or be not inconsistent in nature any further than experience and sensible observation reach herein therefore be found the reality of our knowledge concern substancesthat all our complex ideas of them must be such and such only as be make up of such simple ones as have be discover to coexist in nature and our ideas be thus true though not perhaps very exact copy be yet the subject of real as far as we have any knowledge of them which as have be already show will not be find to reach very far but so far as it do it will still be real knowledge whatever ideas we have the agreement we find they have with others will still be knowledge if those ideas be abstract it will be general knowledge but to make it real concern substances the ideas must be take from the real existence of things whatever simple ideas have be find to coexist in any substance these we may with confidence join together again and so make abstract ideas of substances for whatever have once have an union in nature may be unite again in our inquiries about substances we must consider ideas and not confine our thoughts to name or species suppose set out by name this if we rightly consider and confine not our thoughts and abstract ideas to name as if there be or could be no other sort of things than what know name have already determine and as it be set out we should think of things with greater freedom and less confusion than perhaps we do it would possibly be think a bold paradox if not a very dangerous falsehood if i should say that some changelings who have live forty years together without any appearance of reason be something between a man and a beast which prejudice be found upon nothing else but a false supposition that these two name man and beast stand for distinct species so set out by real essences that there can come no other species between them whereas if we will abstract from those name and the supposition of such specific essences make by nature wherein all things of the same denominations do exactly and equally partake if we would not fancy that there be a certain number of these essences wherein all things as in mould be cast and form we should find that the idea of the shape motion and life of a man without reason be as much a distinct idea and make as much a distinct sort of things from man and beast as the idea of the shape of an ass with reason would be different from either that of man or beast and be a species of an animal between or distinct from both objection against a changeling be something between a man and beast answer here everybody will be ready to ask if changelings may be suppose something between man and beast pray what be they i answer changelings which be as good a word to signify something different from the signification of man or beast as the name man and beast be to have significations different one from the other this well consider would resolve this matter and show my mean without any more ado but i be not so unacquainted with the zeal of some men which enable them to spin consequences and to see religion threaten whenever any one venture to quit their form of speak as not to foresee what name such a proposition as this be like to be charge with and without doubt it will be ask if changelings be something between man and beast what will become of them in the other world to which i answer i it concern me not to know or inquire to their own master they stand or fall it will make their state neither better nor worse whether we determine anything of it or no they be in the hand of a faithful creator and a bountiful father who dispose not of his creatures accord to our narrow thoughts or opinions nor distinguish them accord to name and species of our contrivance and we that know so little of this present world we be in may i think content ourselves without be peremptory in define the different state which creatures shall come into when they go off this stage it may suffice us that he hath make know to all those who be capable of instruction discourse and reason that they shall come to an account and receive accord to what they have do in this body what will become of changelings in a future state but secondly i answer the force of these mens question viz will you deprive changelings of a future state be found on one of these two suppositions which be both false the first be that all things that have the outward shape and appearance of a man must necessarily be design to an immortal future be after this life or secondly that whatever be of human birth must be so take away these imaginations and such question will be groundless and ridiculous i desire then those who think there be no more but an accidental difference between themselves and changelings the essence in both be exactly the same to consider whether they can imagine immortality annex to any outward shape of the body the very propose it be i suppose enough to make them disown it no one yet that ever i hear of how much soever immerse in matter allow that excellency to any figure of the gross sensible outward part as to affirm eternal life due to it or a necessary consequence of it or that any mass of matter should after its dissolution here be again restore hereafter to an everlasting state of sense perception and knowledge only because it be mould into this or that figure and have such a particular frame of its visible part such an opinion as this place immortality in a certain superficial figure turn out of doors all consideration of soul or spirit upon whose account alone some corporeal be have hitherto be conclude immortal and others not this be to attribute more to the outside than inside of things and to place the excellency of a man more in the external shape of his body than internal perfections of his soul which be but little better than to annex the great and inestimable advantage of immortality and life everlasting which he have above other material be to annex it i say to the cut of his beard or the fashion of his coat for this or that outward mark of our body no more carry with it the hope of an eternal duration than the fashion of a man suit give him reasonable ground to imagine it will never wear out or that it will make him immortal it will perhaps be say that nobody think that the shape make anything immortal but it be the shape be the sign of a rational soul within which be immortal i wonder who make it the sign of any such thing for barely say it will not make it so it would require some proof to persuade one of it no figure that i know speak any such language for it may as rationally be conclude that the dead body of a man wherein there be to be find no more appearance or action of life than there be in a statue have yet nevertheless a live soul in it because of its shape as that there be a rational soul in a changeling because he have the outside of a rational creature when his action carry far less mark of reason with them in the whole course of his life than what be to be find in many a beast monsters but it be the issue of rational parent and must therefore be conclude to have a rational soul i know not by what logic you must so conclude i be sure this be a conclusion that men nowhere allow of for if they do they would not make bold as everywhere they do to destroy illformed and misshaped productions ay but these be monsters let them be so what will your drivel unintelligent intractable changeling be shall a defect in the body make a monster a defect in the mind the far more noble and in the common phrase the far more essential part not shall the want of a nose or a neck make a monster and put such issue out of the rank of men the want of reason and understand not this be to bring all back again to what be explode just now this be to place all in the shape and to take the measure of a man only by his outside to show that accord to the ordinary way of reason in this matter people do lay the whole stress on the figure and resolve the whole essence of the species of man as they make it into the outward shape how unreasonable soever it be and how much soever they disown it we need but trace their thoughts and practice a little further and then it will plainly appear the wellshaped changeling be a man have a rational soul though it appear not this be past doubt say you make the ears a little longer and more point and the nose a little flatter than ordinary and then you begin to boggle make the face yet narrower flatter and longer and then you be at a stand add still more and more of the liken of a brute to it and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal then presently it be a monster and it be demonstration with you that it hath no rational soul and must be destroy where now i ask shall be the just measure which the utmost bound of that shape that carry with it a rational soul for since there have be human foetuses produce half beast and half man and others three part one and one part the other and so it be possible they may be in all the variety of approach to the one or the other shape and may have several degrees of mixture of the liken of a man or a brutei would gladly know what be those precise lineaments which accord to this hypothesis be or be not capable of a rational soul to be join to them what sort of outside be the certain sign that there be or be not such an inhabitant within for till that be do we talk at random of man and shall always i fear do so as long as we give ourselves up to certain sound and the imaginations of settle and fix species in nature we know not what but after all i desire it may be consider that those who think they have answer the difficulty by tell us that a misshaped foetus be a monster run into the same fault they be argue against by constitute a species between man and beast for what else i pray be their monster in the case if the word monster signify anything at all but something neither man nor beast but partake somewhat of either and just so be the changeling before mention so necessary be it to quit the common notion of species and essences if we will truly look into the nature of things and examine them by what our faculties can discover in them as they exist and not by groundless fancy that have be take up about them word and species i have mention this here because i think we can not be too cautious that word and species in the ordinary notions which we have be use to of them impose not on us for i be apt to think therein lie one great obstacle to our clear and distinct knowledge especially in reference to substances and from thence have rise a great part of the difficulties about truth and certainty would we accustom ourselves to separate our contemplations and reason from word we might in a great measure remedy this inconvenience within our own thoughts but yet it would still disturb us in our discourse with others as long as we retain the opinion that species and their essences be anything else but our abstract ideas such as they be with name annex to them to be the sign of them recapitulation wherever we perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas there be certain knowledge and wherever we be sure those ideas agree with the reality of things there be certain real knowledge of which agreement of our ideas with the reality of things have here give the mark i think i have show wherein it be that certainty real certainty consist which whatever it be to others be i confess to me heretofore one of those desiderata which i find great want of of truth in general what truth be what be truth be an inquiry many age since and it be that which all mankind either do or pretend to search after it can not but be worth our while carefully to examine wherein it consist and so acquaint ourselves with the nature of it as to observe how the mind distinguish it from falsehood a right join or separate of sign ie either ideas or word truth then seem to me in the proper import of the word to signify nothing but the join or separate of sign as the things signify by them do agree or disagree one with another the join or separate of sign here mean be what by another name we call proposition so that truth properly belong only to proposition whereof there be two sort viz mental and verbal as there be two sort of sign commonly make use of viz ideas and word which make mental or verbal proposition to form a clear notion of truth it be very necessary to consider truth of think and truth of word distinctly one from another but yet it be very difficult to treat of them asunder because it be unavoidable in treat of mental proposition to make use of word and then the instance give of mental proposition cease immediately to be barely mental and become verbal for a mental proposition be nothing but a bare consideration of the ideas as they be in our mind strip of name they lose the nature of purely mental proposition as soon as they be put into word mental proposition be very hard to he treat of and that which make it yet harder to treat of mental and verbal proposition separately be that most men if not all in their think and reason within themselves make use of word instead of ideas at least when the subject of their meditation contain in it complex ideas which be a great evidence of the imperfection and uncertainty of our ideas of that kind and may if attentively make use of serve for a mark to show us what be those things we have clear and perfect establish ideas of and what not for if we will curiously observe the way our mind take in think and reason we shall find i suppose that when we make any proposition within our own thoughts about white or black sweet or bitter a triangle or a circle we can and often do frame in our mind the ideas themselves without reflect on the name but when we would consider or make proposition about the more complex ideas as of a man vitriol fortitude glory we usually put the name for the idea because the ideas these name stand for be for the most part imperfect confuse and undetermined we reflect on the name themselves because they be more clear certain and distinct and readier occur to our thoughts than the pure ideas and so we make use of these word instead of the ideas themselves even when we would meditate and reason within ourselves and make tacit mental proposition in substances as have be already notice this be occasion by the imperfections of our ideas we make the name stand for the real essence of which we have no idea at all in modes it be occasion by the great number of simple ideas that go to the make them up for many of them be compound the name occur much easier than the complex idea itself which require time and attention to be recollect and exactly represent to the mind even in those men who have formerly be at the pain to do it and be utterly impossible to be do by those who though they have ready in their memory the greatest part of the common word of that language yet perhaps never trouble themselves in all their live to consider what precise ideas the most of them stand for some confuse or obscure notions have serve their turn and many who talk very much of religion and conscience of church and faith of power and right of obstructions and humour melancholy and choler would perhaps have little leave in their thoughts and meditations if one should desire them to think only of the things themselves and lay by those word with which they so often confound others and not seldom themselves also mental and verbal proposition contrast but to return to the consideration of truth we must i say observe two sort of proposition that we be capable of make first mental wherein the ideas in our understand be without the use of word put together or separate by the mind perceive or judge of their agreement or disagreement secondly verbal proposition which be word the sign of our ideas put together or separate in affirmative or negative sentence by which way of affirm or deny these sign make by sound be as it be put together or separate one from another so that proposition consist in join or separate sign and truth consist in the put together or separate those sign accord as the things which they stand for agree or disagree when mental proposition contain real truth and when verbal every ones experience will satisfy him that the mind either by perceive or suppose the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas do tacitly within itself put them into a kind of proposition affirmative or negative which i have endeavour to express by the term put together and separate but this action of the mind which be so familiar to ev ery think and reason man be easier to be conceive by reflect on what pass in us when we affirm or deny than to be explain by word when a man have in his head the idea of two line viz the side and diagonal of a square whereof the diagonal be an inch long he may have the idea also of the division of that line into a certain number of equal part vg into five ten a hundred a thousand or any other number and may have the idea of that inch line be divisible or not divisible into such equal part as a certain number of them will be equal to the sideline now whenever he perceive believe or suppose such a kind of divisibility to agree or disagree to his idea of that line he as it be join or separate those two ideas viz the idea of that line and the idea of that kind of divisibility and so make a mental proposition which be true or false accord as such a kind of divisibility a divisibility into such aliquot part do really agree to that line or no when ideas be so put together or separate in the mind as they or the things they stand for do agree or not that be as i may call it mental truth but truth of word be something more and that be the affirm or deny of word one of another as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree and this again be twofold either purely verbal and trifle which i shall speak of chap viii or real and instructive which be the object of that real knowledge which we have speak of already objection against verbal truth that thus it may all be chimerical but here again will be apt to occur the same doubt about truth that do about knowledge and it will be object that if truth be nothing but the join and separate of word in proposition as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree in mens mind the knowledge of truth be not so valuable a thing as it be take to be nor worth the pain and time men employ in the search of it since by this account it amount to no more than the conformity of word to the chimeras of mens brain who know not what odd notions many mens head be fill with and what strange ideas all mens brain be capable of but if we rest here we know the truth of nothing by this rule but of the visionary word in our own imaginations nor have other truth but what as much concern harpies and centaurs as men and horse for those and the like may be ideas in our head and have their agreement or disagreement there as well as the ideas of real be and so have as true proposition make about them and it will be altogether as true a proposition to say all centaurs be animals as that all men be animals and the certainty of one as great as the other for in both the proposition the word be put together accord to the agreement of the ideas in our mind and the agreement of the idea of animal with that of centaur be as clear and visible to the mind as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of man and so these two proposition be equally true equally certain but of what use be all such truth to us answer real truth be about ideas agree to things though what have be say in the forego chapter to distinguish real from imaginary knowledge might suffice here in answer to this doubt to distinguish real truth from chimerical or if you please barely nominal they depend both on the same foundation yet it may not be amiss here again to consider that though our word signify nothing but our ideas yet be design by them to signify things the truth they contain when put into proposition will be only verbal when they stand for ideas in the mind that have not an agreement with the reality of things and therefore truth as well as knowledge may well come under the distinction of verbal and real that be only verbal truth wherein term be join accord to the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for without regard whether our ideas be such as really have or be capable of have an existence in nature but then it be they contain real truth when these sign be join as our ideas agree and when our ideas be such as we know be capable of have an existence in nature which in substances we can not know but by know that such have exist truth and falsehood in general truth be the mark down in word the agreement or disagreement of ideas as it be falsehood be the mark down in word the agreement or disagreement of ideas otherwise than it be and so far as these ideas thus mark by sound agree to their archetypes so far only be the truth real the knowledge of this truth consist in know what ideas the word stand for and the perception of the agreement or disagreement of those ideas accord as it be mark by those word general proposition to be treat of more at large but because word be look on as the great conduits of truth and knowledge and that in convey and receive of truth and commonly in reason about it we make use of word and proposition i shall more at large inquire wherein the certainty of real truths contain in proposition consist and where it be to be have and endeavour to show in what sort of universal proposition we be capable of be certain of their real truth or falsehood i shall begin with general proposition as those which most employ our thoughts and exercise our contemplation general truths be most look after by the mind as those that most enlarge our knowledge and by their comprehensiveness satisfy us at once of many particulars enlarge our view and shorten our way to knowledge moral and metaphysical truth besides truth take in the strict sense before mention there be other sort of truths as moral truth which be speak of things accord to the persuasion of our own mind though the proposition we speak agree not to the reality of things metaphysical truth which be nothing but the real existence of things conformable to the ideas to which we have annex their name this though it seem to consist in the very be of things yet when consider a little nearly will appear to include a tacit proposition whereby the mind join that particular thing to the idea it have before settle with the name to it but these considerations of truth either have be before take notice of or not be much to our present purpose it may suffice here only to have mention them i of universal proposition their truth and certainty treat of word necessary to knowledge though the examine and judge of ideas by themselves their name be quite lay aside be the best and surest way to clear and distinct knowledge yet through the prevail custom of use sound for ideas i think it be very seldom practise every one may observe how common it be for name to be make use of instead of the ideas themselves even when men think and reason within their own breast especially if the ideas be very complex and make up of a great collection of simple ones this make the consideration of word and proposition so necessary a part of the treatise of knowledge that it be very hard to speak intelligibly of the one without explain the other general truths hardly to be understand but in verbal proposition all the knowledge we have be only of particular or general truths it be evident that whatever may be do in the former of these the latter which be that which with reason be most seek after can never be well make know and be very seldom apprehend but as conceive and express in word it be not therefore out of our way in the examination of our knowledge to inquire into the truth and certainty of universal proposition certainty twofoldof truth and of knowledge but that we may not be mislead in this case by that which be the danger everywhere i mean by the doubtfulness of term it be fit to observe that certainty be twofold certainty of truth and certainty of knowledge certainty of truth be when word be so put together in proposition as exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for as really it be certainty of knowledge be to perceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas as express in any proposition this we usually call know or be certain of the truth of any proposition no proposition can be certainly know to be true where the real essence of each species mention be not know now because we can not be certain of the truth of any general proposition unless we know the precise bound and extent of the species its term stand for it be necessary we should know the essence of each species which be that which constitute and bound it this in all simple ideas and modes be not hard to do for in these the real and nominal essence be the same or which be all one the abstract idea which the general term stand for be the sole essence and boundary that be or can be suppose of the species there can be no doubt how far the species extend or what things be comprehend under each term which it be evident be all that have an exact conformity with the idea it stand for and no other but in substances wherein a real essence distinct from the nominal be suppose to constitute determine and bind the species the extent of the general word be very uncertain because not know this real essence we can not know what be or what be not of that species and consequently what may or may not with certainty be affirm of it and thus speak of a man or gold or any other species of natural substances as suppose constitute by a precise and real essence which nature regularly impart to every individual of that kind whereby it be make to be of that species we can not be certain of the truth of any affirmation or negation make of it for man or gold take in this sense and use for species of things constitute by real essences different from the complex idea in the mind of the speaker stand for we know not what and the extent of these species with such boundaries be so unknown and undetermined that it be impossible with any certainty to affirm that all men be rational or that all gold be yellow but where the nominal essence be keep to as the boundary of each species and men extend the application of any general term no further than to the particular things in which the complex idea it stand for be to be find there they be in no danger to mistake the bound of each species nor can be in doubt on this account whether any proposition be true or not i have choose to explain this uncertainty of proposition in this scholastic way and have make use of the term of essences and species on purpose to show the absurdity and inconvenience there be to think of them as of any other sort of realities than barely abstract ideas with name to them to suppose that the species of things be anything but the sort of them under general name accord as they agree to several abstract ideas of which we make those name the sign be to confound truth and introduce uncertainty into all general proposition that can be make about them though therefore these things might to people not possess with scholastic learn be treat of in a better and clearer way yet those wrong notions of essences or species have get root in most people mind who have receive any tincture from the learn which have prevail in this part of the world be to be discover and remove to make way for that use of word which should convey certainty with it this more particularly concern substances the name of substances then whenever make to stand for species which be suppose to be constitute by real essences which we know not be not capable to convey certainty to the understand of the truth of general proposition make up of such term we can not be sure the reason whereof be plain for how can we be sure that this or that quality be in gold when we know not what be or be not gold since in this way of speak nothing be gold but what partake of an essence which we not know can not know where it be or be not and so can not be sure that any parcel of matter in the world be or be not in this sense gold be incurably ignorant whether it have or have not that which make anything to be call gold ie that real essence of gold whereof we have no idea at all this be as impossible for us to know as it be for a blind man to tell in what flower the colour of a pansy be or be not to be find whilst he have no idea of the colour of a pansy at an or if we could which be impossible certainly know where a real essence which we know not be vg in what parcel of matter the real essence of gold be yet could we not be sure that this or that quality could with truth be affirm of gold since it be impossible for us to know that this or that quality or idea have a necessary connexion with a real essence of which we have no idea at all whatever species that suppose real essence may be imagine to constitute the truth of few universal proposition concern substances be to be know on the other side the name of substances when make use of as they should be for the ideas men have in their mind though they carry a clear and determinate signification with them will not yet serve us to make many universal proposition of whose truth we can be certain not because in this use of them we be uncertain what things be signify by them but because the complex ideas they stand for be such combinations of simple ones as carry not with them any discoverable connexion or repugnancy but with a very few other ideas because necessary coexistence of simple ideas in substances can in few case be know the complex ideas that our name of the species of substances properly stand for be collections of such qualities as have be observe to coexist in an unknown substratum which we call substance but what other qualities necessarily coexist with such combinations we can not certainly know unless we can discover their natural dependence which in their primary qualities we can go but a very little way in and in all their secondary qualities we can discover no connexion at all for the reason mention chap iii viz because we know not the real constitutions of substances on which each secondary quality particularly depend do we know that it would serve us only for experimental not universal knowledge and reach with certainty no further than that bare instance because our understand can discover no conceivable connexion between any secondary quality and any modification whatsoever of any of the primary ones and therefore there be very few general proposition to be make concern substances which can carry with them undoubted certainty instance in gold all gold be fix be a proposition whose truth we can not be certain of how universally soever it be believe for if accord to the useless imagination of the school any one suppose the term gold to stand for a species of things set out by nature by a real essence belong to it it be evident he know not what particular substances be of that species and so can not with certainty affirm anything universally of gold but if he make gold stand for a species determine by its nominal essence let the nominal essence for example be the complex idea of a body of a certain yellow colour malleable fusible and heavier than any other knownin this proper use of the word gold there be no difficulty to know what be or be not gold but yet no other quality can with certainty be universally affirm or deny of gold but what hath a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with that nominal essence fixedness for example have no necessary connexion that we can discover with the colour weight or any other simple idea of our complex one or with the whole combination together it be impossible that we should certainly know the truth of this proposition that all gold be fix no discoverable necessary connexion between nominal essence of gold and other simple ideas as there be no discoverable connexion between fixedness and the colour weight and other simple ideas of that nominal essence of gold so if we make our complex idea of gold a body yellow fusible ductile weighty and fix we shall be at the same uncertainty concern solubility in aqua regia and for the same reason since we can never from consideration of the ideas themselves with certainty affirm or deny of a body whose complex idea be make up of yellow very weighty ductile fusible and fix that it be soluble in aqua regia and so on of the rest of its qualities i would gladly meet with one general affirmation concern any quality of gold that any one can certainly know be true it will no doubt be presently object be not this an universal proposition all gold be malleable to which i answer it be a very certain proposition if malleableness be a part of the complex idea the word gold stand for but then here be nothing affirm of gold but that that sound stand for an idea in which malleableness be contain and such a sort of truth and certainty as this it be to say a centaur be fourfooted but if malleableness make not a part of the specific essence the name of gold stand for it be plain all gold be malleable be not a certain proposition because let the complex idea of gold be make up of whichsoever of its other qualities you please malleableness will not appear to depend on that complex idea nor follow from any simple one contain in it the connexion that malleableness have if it have any with those other qualities be only by the intervention of the real constitution of its insensible part which since we know not it be impossible we should perceive that connexion unless we could discover that which tie them together as far as any such coexistence can be know so far universal proposition may be certain but this will go but a little way the more indeed of these coexist qualities we unite into one complex idea under one name the more precise and determinate we make the signification of that word but never yet make it thereby more capable of universal certainty in respect of other qualities not contain in our complex idea since we perceive not their connexion or dependence on one another be ignorant both of that real constitution in which they be all found and also how they flow from it for the chief part of our knowledge concern substances be not as in other things barely of the relation of two ideas that may exist separately but be of the necessary connexion and coexistence of several distinct ideas in the same subject or of their repugnancy so to coexist could we begin at the other end and discover what it be wherein that colour consist what make a body lighter or heavier what texture of part make it malleable fusible and fix and fit to be dissolve in this sort of liquor and not in anotherif i say we have such an idea as this of body and could perceive wherein all sensible qualities originally consist and how they be produce we might frame such abstract ideas of them as would furnish us with matter of more general knowledge and enable us to make universal proposition that should carry general truth and certainty with them but whilst our complex ideas of the sort of substances be so remote from that internal real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend and be make up of nothing but an imperfect collection of those apparent qualities our sense can discover there can be few general proposition concern substances of whose real truth we can be certainly assure since there be but few simple ideas of whose connexion and necessary coexistence we can have certain and undoubted knowledge i imagine amongst all the secondary qualities of substances and the power relate to them there can not any two be name whose necessary coexistence or repugnance to coexist can certainly be know unless in those of the same sense which necessarily exclude one another as i have elsewhere show no one i think by the colour that be in any body can certainly know what smell taste sound or tangible qualities it have nor what alterations it be capable to make or receive on or from other body the same may be say of the sound or taste c our specific name of substances stand for any collections of such ideas it be not to be wonder that we can with them make very few general proposition of undoubted real certainty but yet so far as any complex idea of any sort of substances contain in it any simple idea whose necessary existence with any other may be discover so far universal proposition may with certainty be make concern it vg could any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and the colour or weight of gold or any other part of the complex idea signify by that name he might make a certain universal proposition concern gold in this respect and the real truth of this proposition that all gold be malleable would be as certain as of this the three angle of all rightlined triangles be all equal to two right ones the qualities which make our complex ideas of substances depend mostly on external remote and unperceived cause have we such ideas of substances as to know what real constitutions produce those sensible qualities we find in them and how those qualities flow from thence we could by the specific ideas of their real essences in our own mind more certainly find out their properties and discover what qualities they have or have not than we can now by our sense and to know the properties of gold it would be no more necessary that gold should exist and that we should make experiment upon it than it be necessary for the know the prop erties of a triangle that a triangle should exist in any matter the idea in our mind would serve for the one as well as the other but we be so far from be admit into the secrets of nature that we scarce so much as ever approach the first entrance towards them for we be wont to consider the substances we meet with each of them as an entire thing by itself have all its qualities in itself and independent of other things overlook for the most part the operations of those invisible fluids they be encompass with and upon whose motion and operations depend the greatest part of those qualities which be take notice of in them and be make by us the inherent mark of distinction whereby we know and denominate them put a piece of gold anywhere by itself separate from the reach and influence of all other body it will immediately lose all its colour and weight and perhaps malleableness too which for aught i know would be change into a perfect friability water in which to us fluidity be an essential quality leave to itself would cease to be fluid but if inanimate body owe so much of their present state to other body without them that they would not be what they appear to us be those body that environ them remove it be yet more so in vegetables which be nourish grow and produce leave flower and seed in a constant succession and if we look a little nearer into the state of animals we shall find that their dependence as to life motion and the most considerable qualities to be observe in them be so wholly on extrinsical cause and qualities of other body that make no part of them that they can not subsist a moment without them though yet those body on which they depend be little take notice of and make no part of the complex ideas we frame of those animals take the air but for a minute from the greatest part of live creatures and they presently lose sense life and motion this the necessity of breathe have force into our knowledge but how many other extrinsical and possibly very remote body do the spring of these admirable machine depend on which be not vulgarly observe or so much as think on and how many be there which the severest inquiry can never discover the inhabitants of this spot of the universe though remove so many millions of miles from the sun yet depend so much on the duly temper motion of particles come from or agitate by it that be this earth remove but a small part of the distance out of its present situation and place a little further or nearer that source of heat it be more than probable that the greatest part of the animals in it would immediately perish since we find them so often destroy by an excess or defect of the sun warmth which an accidental position in some part of this our little globe expose them to the qualities observe in a loadstone must need have their source far beyond the confine of that body and the ravage make often on several sort of animals by invisible cause the certain death as we be tell of some of them by barely pass the line or as it be certain of other by be remove into a neighbour country evidently show that the concurrence and operations of several body with which they be seldom think to have anything to do be absolutely necessary to make them be what they appear to us and to preserve those qualities by which we know and distinguish them we be then quite out of the way when we think that things contain within themselves the qualities that appear to us in them and we in vain search for that constitution within the body of a fly or an elephant upon which depend those qualities and power we observe in them for which perhaps to understand them aright we ought to look not only beyond this our earth and atmosphere but even beyond the sun or remotest star our eye have yet discover for how much the be and operation of particular substances in this our globe depend on cause utterly beyond our view be impossible for us to determine we see and perceive some of the motion and grosser operations of things here about us but whence the stream come that keep all these curious machine in motion and repair how convey and modify be beyond our notice and apprehension and the great part and wheel as i may say so of this stupendous structure of the universe may for aught we know have such a connexion and dependence in their influence and operations one upon another that perhaps things in this our mansion would put on quite another face and cease to be what they be if some one of the star or great body incomprehensibly remote from us should cease to be or move as it do this be certain things however absolute and entire they seem in themselves be but retainers to other part of nature for that which they be most take notice of by us their observable qualities action and power be owe to something without them and there be not so complete and perfect a part that we know of nature which do not owe the be it have and the excellences of it to its neighbour and we must not confine our thoughts within the surface of any body but look a great deal further to comprehend perfectly those qualities that be in it our nominal essences of substances furnish few universal proposition about them that be certain if this be so it be not to be wonder that we have very imperfect ideas of substances and that the real essences on which depend their properties and operations be unknown to us we can not discover so much as that size figure and texture of their minute and active part which be really in them much less the different motion and impulses make in and upon them by body from without upon which depend and by which be form the greatest and most remarkable part of those qualities we observe in them and of which our complex ideas of them be make up this consideration alone be enough to put an end to all our hop of ever have the ideas of their real essences which whilst we want the nominal essences we make use of instead of them will be able to furnish us but very sparingly with any general knowledge or universal proposition capable of real certainty judgment of probability concern substances may reach further but that be not knowledge we be not therefore to wonder if certainty be to be find in very few general proposition make concern substances our knowledge of their qualities and properties go very seldom further than our sense reach and inform us possibly inquisitive and observe men may by strength of judgment penetrate further and on probabilities take from wary observation and hint well lay together often guess right at what experience have not yet discov ered to them but this be but guess still it amount only to opinion and have not that certainty which be requisite to knowledge for all general knowledge lie only in our own thoughts and consist barely in the contemplation of our own abstract ideas wherever we perceive any agreement or disagreement amongst them there we have general knowledge and by put the name of those ideas together accordingly in proposition can with certainty pronounce general truths but because the abstract ideas of substances for which their specific name stand whenever they have any distinct and determinate signification have a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with but a very few other ideas the certainty of universal proposition concern substances be very narrow and scanty in that part which be our principal inquiry concern them and there be scarce any of the name of substances let the idea it be apply to be what it will of which we can generally and with certainty pronounce that it have or have not this or that other quality belong to it and constantly coexist or inconsistent with that idea wherever it be to be find what be requisite for our knowledge of substances before we can have any tolerable knowledge of this kind we must first know what change the primary qualities of one body do regularly produce in the primary qualities of another and how secondly we must know what primary qualities of any body produce certain sensations or ideas in us this be in truth no less than to know all the effect of matter under its divers modifications of bulk figure cohesion of part motion and rest which i think every body will allow be utterly impossible to be know by us without revelation nor if it be reveal to us what sort of figure bulk and motion of corpuscles would produce in us the sensation of a yellow colour and what sort of figure bulk and texture of part in the superficies of any body be fit to give such corpuscles their due motion to produce that colour would that be enough to make universal proposition with certainty concern the several sort of them unless we have faculties acute enough to perceive the precise bulk figure texture and motion of body in those minute part by which they operate on our sense so that we might by those frame our abstract ideas of them i have mention here only corporeal substances whose operations seem to lie more level to our understand for as to the operations of spirit both their think and move of body we at first sight find ourselves at a loss though perhaps when we have apply our thoughts a little nearer to the consideration of body and their operations and examine how far our notions even in these reach with any clearness beyond sensible matter of fact we shall be bind to confess that even in these too our discoveries amount to very little beyond perfect ignorance and incapacity whilst our complex ideas of substances contain not ideas of their real constitutions we can make but few general certain proposition concern them this be evident the abstract complex ideas of substances for which their general name stand not comprehend their real constitutions can afford us very little universal certainty because our ideas of them be not make up of that on which those qualities we observe in them and would inform ourselves about do depend or with which they have any certain connexion vg let the ideas to which we give the name man be as it commonly be a body of the ordinary shape with sense voluntary motion and reason join to it this be the abstract idea and consequently the essence of our species man we can make but very few general certain proposition concern man stand for such an idea because not know the real constitution on which sensation power of motion and reason with that peculiar shape depend and whereby they be unite together in the same subject there be very few other qualities with which we can perceive them to have a necessary connexion and therefore we can not with certainty affirm that all men sleep by intervals that no man can be nourish by wood or stone that all men will be poison by hemlock because these ideas have no connexion nor repugnancy with this our nominal essence of man with this abstract idea that name stand for we must in these and the like appeal to trial in particular subject which can reach but a little way we must content ourselves with probability in the rest but can have no general certainty whilst our specific idea of man contain not that real constitution which be the root wherein all his inseparable qualities be unite and from whence they flow whilst our idea the word man stand for be only an imperfect collection of some sensible qualities and power in him there be no discernible connexion or repugnance between our specific idea and the operation of either the part of hemlock or stone upon his constitution there be animals that safely eat hemlock and others that be nourish by wood and stone but as long as we want ideas of those real constitutions of different sort of animals whereon these and the like qualities and power depend we must not hope to reach certainty in universal proposition concern them those few ideas only which have a discernible connexion with our nominal essence or any part of it can afford us such proposition but these be so few and of so little moment that we may justly look on our certain general knowledge of substances as almost none at all wherein lie the general certainty of proposition to conclude general proposition of what kind soever be then only capable of certainty when the term use in them stand for such ideas whose agreement or disagreement as there express be capable to be discover by us and we be then certain of their truth or falsehood when we perceive the ideas the term stand for to agree or not agree accord as they be affirm or deny one of another whence we may take notice that general certainty be never to be find but in our ideas whenever we go to seek it elsewhere in experiment or observations without us our knowledge go not beyond particulars it be the contemplation of our own abstract ideas that alone be able to afford us general knowledge ii of maxims maxims or axioms be selfevident proposition there be a sort of proposition which under the name of maxims and axioms have pass for principles of science and because they be selfevident have be suppose in nate without that anybody that i know ever go about to show the reason and foundation of their clearness or cogency it may however be worth while to inquire into the reason of their evidence and see whether it be peculiar to them alone and also to examine how far they influence and govern our other knowledge wherein that selfevidence consist knowledge as have be show consist in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas now where that agreement or disagreement be perceive immediately by itself without the intervention or help of any other there our knowledge be selfevident this will appear to be so to any who will but consider any of those proposition which without any proof he assent to at first sight for in all of them he will find that the reason of his assent be from that agreement or disagreement which the mind by an immediate compare them find in those ideas answer the affirmation or negation in the proposition selfevidence not peculiar to receive axioms this be so in the next place let us consider whether this selfevidence be peculiar only to those proposition which commonly pass under the name of maxims and have the dignity of axioms allow them and here it be plain that several other truths not allow to be axioms partake equally with them in this selfevidence this we shall see if we go over these several sort of agreement or disagreement of ideas which i have above mention viz identity relation coexistence and real existence which will discover to us that not only those few proposition which have have the credit of maxims be selfevident but a great many even almost an infinite number of other proposition be such i as to identity and diversity all proposition be equally selfevident for first the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of identity be found in the mind have distinct ideas this afford us as many selfevident proposition as we have distinct ideas every one that have any knowledge at all have as the foundation of it various and distinct ideas and it be the first act of the mind without which it can never be capable of any knowledge to know every one of its ideas by itself and distinguish it from others every one find in himself that he know the ideas he have that he know also when any one be in his understand and what it be and that when more than one be there he know them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another which always be so it be impossible but that he should perceive what he perceive he can never be in doubt when any idea be in his mind that it be there and be that idea it be and that two distinct ideas when they be in his mind be there and be not one and the same idea so that all such affirmations and negations be make without any possibility of doubt uncertainty or hesitation and must necessarily be assent to as soon as understand that be as soon as we have in our mind determine ideas which the term in the proposition stand for and therefore whenever the mind with attention consider any proposition so as to perceive the two ideas signify by the term and affirm or deny one of the other to be the same or different it be presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition and this equally whether these proposition be in term stand for more general ideas or such as be less so vg whether the general idea of be be affirm of itself as in this proposition whatsoever be be or a more particular idea be affirm of itself as a man be a man or whatsoever be white be white or whether the idea of be in general be deny of notbeing which be the only if i may so call it idea different from it as in this other proposition it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be or any idea of any particular be be deny of another different from it as a man be not a horse red be not blue the difference of the ideas as soon as the term be understand make the truth of the proposition presently visible and that with an equal certainty and easiness in the less as well as the more general proposition and all for the same reason viz because the mind perceive in any ideas that it have the same idea to be the same with itself and two different ideas to be different and not the same and this it be equally certain of whether these ideas be more or less general abstract and comprehensive it be not therefore alone to these two general propositionswhatsoever be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that this sort of selfevidence belong by any peculiar right the perception of be or not be belong no more to these vague ideas signify by the term whatsoever and thing than it do to any other ideas these two general maxims amount to no more in short but this that the same be the same and the same be not different be truths know in more particular instance as well as in those general maxims and know also in particular instance before these general maxims be ever think on and draw all their force from the discernment of the mind employ about particular ideas there be nothing more visible than that the mind without the help of any proof or reflection on either of these general proposition perceive so clearly and know so certainly that the idea of white be the idea of white and not the idea of blue and that the idea of white when it be in the mind be there and be not absent that the consideration of these axioms can add nothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge just so it be as every one may experiment in himself in all the ideas a man have in his mind he know each to be itself and not to be another and to be in his mind and not away when it be there with a certainty that can not be greater and therefore the truth of no general proposition can be know with a greater certainty nor add anything to this so that in respect of identity our intuitive knowledge reach as far as our ideas and we be capable of make as many selfevident proposition as we have name for distinct ideas and i appeal to every ones own mind whether this proposition a circle be a circle be not as selfevident a proposition as that consist of more general term whatsoever be be and again whether this proposition blue be not red be not a proposition that the mind can no more doubt of as soon as it understand the word than it do of that axiom it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and so of all the like ii in coexistence we have few selfevident proposition secondly as to coexistence or such a necessary connexion between two ideas that in the subject where one of them be suppose there the other must necessarily be also of such agreement or disagreement as this the mind have an immediate perception but in very few of them and therefore in this sort we have but very little intuitive knowledge nor be there to be find very many proposition that be selfevident though some there be vg the idea of fill a place equal to the content of its superficies be annex to our idea of body i think it be a selfevident proposition that two body can not be in the same place iii in other relations we may have many thirdly as to the relations of modes mathematicians have frame many axioms concern that one relation of equality as equal take from equal the remainder will be equal which with the rest of that kind however they be receive for maxims by the mathematicians and be unquestionable truths yet i think that any one who consider them will not find that they have a clearer selfevidence than thesethat one and one be equal to two that if you take from the five finger of one hand two and from the five finger of the other hand two the remain number will be equal these and a thousand other such proposition may be find in number which at the very first hear force the assent and carry with them an equal if not greater clearness than those mathematical axioms iv concern real existence we have none fourthly as to real existence since that have no connexion with any other of our ideas but that of ourselves and of a first be we have in that concern the real existence of all other be not so much as demonstrative much less a selfevident knowledge and therefore concern those there be no maxims these axioms do not much influence our other knowledge in the next place let us consider what influence these receive maxims have upon the other part of our knowledge the rule establish in the school that all reason be ex praeognitis et praeconcessis seem to lay the foundation of all other knowledge in these maxims and to suppose them to be praecognita whereby i think be mean these two things first that these axioms be those truths that be first know to the mind and secondly that upon them the other part of our knowledge depend because maxims or axioms be not the truths we first know first that they be not the truths first know to the mind be evident to experience as we have show in another place bk i chap i who perceive not that a child certainly know that a stranger be not its mother that its suckingbottle be not the rod long before he know that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and how many truths be there about number which it be obvious to observe that the mind be perfectly acquaint with and fully convince of before it ever think on these general maxims to which mathematicians in their argue do sometimes refer them whereof the reason be very plain for that which make the mind assent to such proposition be nothing else but the perception it have of the agreement or disagreement of its ideas accord as it find them affirm or deny one of another in word it understand and every idea be know to be what it be and every two distinct ideas be know not to be the same it must necessarily follow that such selfevident truths must be first know which consist of ideas that be first in the mind and the ideas first in the mind it be evident be those of particular things from whence by slow degrees the understand proceed to some few general ones which be take from the ordinary and familiar object of sense be settle in the mind with general name to them thus particular ideas be first receive and distinguish and so knowledge get about them and next to them the less general or specific which be next to particular for abstract ideas be not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grow men it be only because by constant and familiar use they be make so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas be fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we be apt to imagine for example do it not require some pain and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which be yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it be something imperfect that can not exist an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistent ideas be put together it be true the mind in this imperfect state have need of such ideas and make all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it be naturally very much incline but yet one have reason to suspect such ideas be mark of our imperfection at least this be enough to show that the most abstract and general ideas be not those that the mind be first and most easily acquaint with nor such as its earliest knowledge be conversant about because on perception of them the other part of our knowledge do not depend secondly from what have be say it plainly follow that these magnify maxims be not the principles and foundations of all our other knowledge for if there be a great many other truths which have as much selfevidence as they and a great many that we know before them it be impossible they should be the principles from which we deduce all other truths be it impossible to know that one and two be equal to three but by virtue of this or some such axiom viz the whole be equal to all its part take together many a one know that one and two be equal to three without have hear or think on that or any other axiom by which it might be prove and know it as certainly as any other man know that the whole be equal to all its part or any other maxim and all from the same reason of selfevidence the equality of those ideas be as visible and certain to him without that or any other axiom as with it it need no proof to make it perceive nor after the knowledge that the whole be equal to all its part do he know that one and two be equal to three better or more certainly than he do before for if there be any odds in those ideas the whole and part be more obscure or at least more difficult to be settle in the mind than those of one two and three and indeed i think i may ask these men who will need have all knowledge besides those general principles themselves to depend on general innate and selfevident principles what principle be requisite to prove that one and one be two that two and two be four that three time two be six which be know without any proof do evince that either all knowledge do not depend on certain praecognita or general maxims call principles or else that these be principles and if these be to be count principles a great part of numeration will be so to which if we add all the selfevident proposition which may be make about all our distinct ideas principles will be almost infinite at least innumerable which men arrive to the knowledge of at different age and a great many of these innate principles they never come to know all their live but whether they come in view of the mind earlier or later this be true of them that they be all know by their native evidence be wholly independent receive no light nor be capable of any proof one from another much less the more particular from the more general or the more simple from the more compound the more simple and less abstract be the most familiar and the easier and earlier apprehend but whichever be the clearest ideas the evidence and certainty of all such proposition be in this that a man see the same idea to be the same idea and infallibly perceive two different ideas to be different ideas for when a man have in his understand the ideas of one and of two the idea of yellow and the idea of blue he can not but certainly know that the idea of one be the idea of one and not the idea of two and that the idea of yellow be the idea of yellow and not the idea of blue for a man can not confound the ideas in his mind which he have distinct that would be to have them confuse and distinct at the same time which be a contradiction and to have none distinct be to have no use of our faculties to have no knowledge at all and therefore what idea soever be affirm of itself or whatsoever two entire distinct ideas be deny one of another the mind can not but assent to such a proposition as infallibly true as soon as it understand the term without hesitation or need of proof or regard those make in more general term and call maxims what use these general maxims or axioms have what shall we then say be these general maxims of no use by no mean though perhaps their use be not that which it be commonly take to be but since doubt in the least of what hath be by some men ascribe to these maxims may be apt to be cry out against as overturn the foundations of all the sciences it may be worth while to consider them with respect to other part of our knowledge and examine more particularly to what purpose they serve and to what not it be evident from what have be already say that they be of no use to prove or confirm less general selfevident proposition it be as plain that they be not nor have be the foundations whereon any science hath be build there be i know a great deal of talk propagate from scholastic men of sciences and the maxims on which they be build but it have be my illluck never to meet with any such sciences much less any one build upon these two maxims what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and i would be glad to be show where any such science erect upon these or any other general axioms be to be find and should be oblige to any one who would lay before me the frame and system of any science so build on these or any such like maxims that could not be show to stand as firm without any consideration of them i ask whether these general maxims have not the same use in the study of divinity and in theological question that they have in other sciences they serve here too to silence wranglers and put an end to dispute but i think that nobody will therefore say that the christian religion be build upon these maxims or that the knowledge we have of it be derive from these principals it be from revelation we have receive it and without revelation these maxims have never be able to help us to it when we find out an idea by whose intervention we discover the connexion of two others this be a revelation from god to us by the voice of reason for we then come to know a truth that we do not know before when god declare any truth to us this be a revelation to us by the voice of his spirit and we be advance in our knowledge but in neither of these do we receive our light or knowledge from maxims but in the one the things themselves afford it and we see the truth in them by perceive their agreement or disagreement in the other god himself afford it immediately to us and we see the truth of what he say in his unerring veracity they be not of use to help men forward in the advancement of sciences or new discoveries of yet unknown truths mr newton in his never enough to be admire book have demonstrate several proposition which be so many new truths before unknown to the world and be further advance in mathematical knowledge but for the discovery of these it be not the general maxims what be be or the whole be bigger than a part or the like that help him these be not the clue that lead him into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those proposition nor be it by them that he get the knowledge of those demonstrations but by find out intermediate ideas that show the agreement or disagreement of the ideas as express in the proposition he demonstrate this be the greatest exercise and improvement of human understand in the enlarge of knowledge and advance the sciences wherein they be far enough from receive any help from the contemplation of these or the like magnify maxims would those who have this traditional admiration of these proposition that they think no step can be make in knowledge without the support of an axiom no stone lay in the build of the sciences without a general maxim but distinguish between the method of acquire knowledge and of communicate it between the method of raise any science and that of teach it to others as far as it be advancedthey would see that those general maxims be not the foundations on which the first discoverers raise their admirable structure not the key that unlock and open those secrets of knowledge though afterwards when school be erect and sciences have their professors to teach what others have find out they often make use of maxims ie lay down certain proposition which be selfevident or to be receive for true which be settle in the mind of their scholars as unquestionable verities they on occasion make use of to convince them of truths in particular instance that be not so familiar to their mind as those general axioms which have before be inculcate to them and carefully settle in their mind though these particular instance when well reflect on be no less selfevident to the understand than the general maxims bring to confirm them and it be in those particular instance that the first discoverer find the truth without the help of the general maxims and so may any one else do who with attention consider them maxims of use in the exposition of what have be discover and in silence obstinate wranglers to come therefore to the use that be make of maxims they be of use as have be observe in the ordinary methods of teach sciences as far as they be advance but of little or none in advance them further they be of use in dispute for the silence of obstinate wranglers and bring those contest to some conclusion whether a need of them to that end come not in the manner follow i crave leave to inquire the school have make disputation the touchstone of mens abilities and the criterion of knowledge adjudge victory to him that keep the field and he that have the last word be conclude to have the better of the argument if not of the cause but because by this mean there be like to be no decision between skilful combatants whilst one never fail of a medius terminus to prove any proposition and the other could as constantly without or with a distinction deny the major or minor to prevent as much as could be run out of dispute into an endless train of syllogisms certain general propositionsmost of them indeed selfevidentwere introduce into the school which be such as all men allow and agree in be look on as general measure of truth and serve instead of principles where the disputants have not lie down any other between them beyond which there be no go and which must not be recede from by either side and thus these maxims get the name of principles beyond which men in dispute could not retreat be by mistake take to be the originals and source from whence all knowledge begin and the foundations whereon the sciences be build because when in their dispute they come to any of these they stop there and go no further the matter be determine but how much this be a mistake hath be already show how maxims come to be so much in vogue this method of the school which have be think the fountains of knowledge introduce as i suppose the like use of these maxims into a great part of conversation out of the school to stop the mouth of cavillers whom any one be excuse from argue any longer with when they deny these general selfevident principles receive by all reasonable men who have once think of them but yet their use herein be but to put an end to wrangle they in truth when urge in such case teach nothing that be already do by the intermediate ideas make use of in the debate whose connexion may be see without the help of those maxims and so the truth know before the maxim be produce and the argument bring to a first principle men would give off a wrong argument before it come to that if in their dispute they propose to themselves the find and embrace of truth and not a contest for victory and thus maxims have their use to put a stop to their perverseness whose ingenuity should have yield sooner but the method of the school have allow and encourage men to oppose and resist evident truth till they be baffle ie till they be reduce to contradict themselves or some establish principles it be no wonder that they should not in civil conversation be ashamed of that which in the school be count a virtue and a glory viz obstinately to maintain that side of the question they have choose whether true or false to the last extremity even after conviction a strange way to attain truth and knowledge and that which i think the rational part of mankind not corrupt by education could scarce believe should ever be admit amongst the lovers of truth and students of religion or nature or introduce into the seminaries of those who be to propagate the truths of religion or philosophy amongst the ignorant and unconvinced how much such a way of learn be like to turn young mens mind from the sincere search and love of truth nay and to make them doubt whether there be any such thing or at least worth the adhere to i shall not now inquire this i think that bat those place which bring the peripatetick philosophy into their school where it continue many age without teach the world anything but the art of wrangle these maxims be nowhere think the foundations on which the sciences be build nor the great help to the advancement of knowledge of great use to stop wranglers in dispute but of little use to the discovery of truths as to these general maxims therefore they be as i have say of great use in dispute to stop the mouth of wranglers but not of much use to the discovery of unknown truths or to help the mind forward in its search after knowledge for who ever begin to build his knowledge on the general proposition what be be or it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and from either of these as from a principle of science deduce a system of useful knowledge wrong opinions often involve contradictions one of these maxims as a touchstone may serve well to show whither they lead but yet however fit to lay open the absurdity or mistake of a man reason or opinion they be of very little use for enlighten the understand and it will not be find that the mind receive much help from them in its progress in knowledge which would be neither less nor less certain be these two general proposition never think on it be true as i have say they sometimes serve in argumentation to stop a wranglers mouth by show the absurdity of what he saith and by expose him to the shame of contradict what all the world know and he himself can not but own to be true but it be one thing to show a man that he be in an error and another to put him in possession of truth and i would fain know what truths these two proposition be able to teach and by their influence make us know which we do not know before or could not know without them let us reason from them as well as we can they be only about identical predications and influence if any at all none but such each particular proposition concern identity or diversity be as clearly and certainly know in itself if attend to as either of these general ones only these general ones as serve in all case be therefore more inculcate and insist on as to other less general maxims many of them be no more than bare verbal proposition and teach us nothing but the respect and import of name one to another the whole be equal to all its part what real truth i beseech you do it teach us what more be contain in that maxim than what the signification of the word totum or the whole do of itself import and he that know that the word whole stand for what be make up of all its part know very little less than that the whole be equal to all its part and upon the same grind i think that this proposition a hill be higher than a valley and several the like may also pass for maxims but yet master of mathematics when they would as teachers of what they know initiate others in that science do not without reason place this and some other such maxims at the entrance of their systems that their scholars have in the begin perfectly acquaint their thoughts with these proposition make in such general term may be use to make such reflections and have these more general proposition as form rule and say ready to apply to all particular case not that if they be equally weigh they be more clear and evident than the particular instance they be bring to confirm but that be more familiar to the mind the very name them be enough to satisfy the understand but this i say be more from our custom of use them and the establishment they have get in our mind by our often think of them than from the different evidence of the things but before custom have settle methods of think and reason in our mind i be apt to imagine it be quite otherwise and that the child when a part of his apple be take away know it better in that particular instance than by this general proposition the whole be equal to all its part and that if one of these have need to be confirm to him by the other the general have more need to be let into his mind by the particular than the par ticular by the general for in particulars our knowledge begin and so spread itself by degrees to general though afterwards the mind take the quite contrary course and have draw its knowledge into as general proposition as it can make those familiar to its thoughts and accustom itself to have recourse to them as to the standards of truth and falsehood by which familiar use of them as rule to measure the truth of other proposition it come in time to be think that more particular proposition have their truth and evidence from their conformity to these more general ones which in discourse and argumentation be so frequently urge and constantly admit and this i think to be the reason why amongst so many selfevident proposition the most general only have have the title of maxims maxims if care he not take in the use of word may prove contradictions one thing further i think it may not be amiss to observe concern these general maxims that they be so far from improve or establish our mind in true knowledge that if our notions be wrong loose or unsteady and we resign up our thoughts to the sound of word rather than fix them on settle determine ideas of things i say these general maxims will serve to confirm us in mistake and in such a way of use of word which be most common will serve to prove contradictions vg he that with descartes shall frame in his mind an idea of what he call body to be nothing but extension may easily demonstrate that there be no vacuum ie no space void of body by this maxim what be be for the idea to which he annex the name body be bare extension his knowledge that space can not be without body be certain for he know his own idea of extension clearly and distinctly and know that it be what it be and not another idea though it be call by these three namesextension body space which three word stand for one and the same idea may no doubt with the same evidence and certainty be affirm one of another as each of itself and it be as certain that whilst i use them all to stand for one and the same idea this predication be as true and identical in its signification that space be body as this predication be true and identical that body be body both in signification and sound instance in vacuum but if another should come and make to himself another idea different from descartess of the thing which yet with descartes he call by the same name body and make his idea which he express by the word body to be of a thing that hath both extension and solidity together he will as easily demonstrate that there may be a vacuum or space without a body as descartes demonstrate the contrary because the idea to which he give the name space be barely the simple one of extension and the idea to which he give the name body be the complex idea of extension and resistibility or solidity together in the same subject these two ideas be not exactly one and the same but in the understand as distinct as the ideas of one and two white and black or as of corporeity and humanity if i may use those barbarous term and therefore the predication of them in our mind or in word stand for them be not identical but the negation of them one of another viz this proposition extension or space be not body be as true and evidently certain as this maxim it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be can make any proposition but they prove not the existence of things without us but yet though both these proposition as you see may be equally demonstrate viz that there may be a vacuum and that there can not be a vacuum by these two certain principles viz what be be and the same thing can not be and not be yet neither of these principles will serve to prove to us that any or what body do exist for that we be leave to our sense to discover to us as far as they can those universal and selfevident principles be only our constant clear and distinct knowledge of our own ideas more general or comprehensive can assure us of nothing that pass without the mind their certainty be found only upon the knowledge we have of each idea by itself and of its distinction from others about which we can not be mistake whilst they be in our mind though we may be and often be mistake when we retain the name without the ideas or use them confusedly sometimes for one and sometimes for another idea in which case the force of these axioms reach only to the sound and not the signification of the word serve only to lead us into confusion mistake and error it be to show men that these maxims however cry up for the great guard of truth will not secure them from error in a careless loose use of their word that i have make this remark in all that be here suggest concern their little use for the improvement of knowledge or dangerous use in undetermined ideas i have be far enough from say or intend they should be lay aside as some have be too forward to charge me i affirm them to be truths selfevident truths and so can not be lay aside as far as their influence will reach it be in vain to endeavour nor will i attempt to abridge it but yet without any injury to truth or knowledge i may have reason to think their use be not answerable to the great stress which seem to be lay on them and i may warn men not to make an ill use of them for the confirm themselves in errors they can not add to our knowledge of substances and their application to complex ideas be dangerous but let them be of what use they will in verbal proposition they can not discover or prove to us the least knowledge of the nature of substances as they be find and exist without us any further than ground on experience and though the consequence of these two proposition call principles be very clear and their use not dangerous or hurtful in the probation of such things wherein there be no need at all of them for proof but such as be clear by themselves without them viz where our ideas be determine and know by the name that stand for them yet when these principles viz what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be make use of in the probation of proposition wherein be word stand for complex ideas vg man horse gold virtue there they be of infinite danger and most commonly make men receive and retain falsehood for manifest truth and uncertainty for demonstration upon which follow error obstinacy and all the mischiefs that can happen from wrong reason the reason whereof be not that these principles be less true or of less force in prove proposition make of term stand for complex ideas than where the proposition be about simple ideas but because men mistake generallythinking that where the same term be preserve the proposition be about the same things though the ideas they stand for be in truth different therefore these maxims be make use of to support those which in sound and appearance be contradictory proposition and be clear in the demonstrations above mention about a vacuum so that whilst men take word for things as usually they do these maxims may and do commonly serve to prove contradictory proposition as shall yet be further make manifest instance in demonstrations about man which can only be verbal for instance let man be that concern which you would by these first principles demonstrate anything and we shall see that so far as demonstration be by these principles it be only verbal and give us no certain universal true proposition or knowledge of any be exist without us first a child have frame the idea of a man it be probable that his idea be just like that picture which the painter make of the visible appearances join together and such a complication of ideas together in his understand make up the single complex idea which he call man whereof white or fleshcolour in england be one the child can demonstrate to you that a negro be not a man because white colour be one of the constant simple ideas of the complex idea he call man and therefore he can demonstrate by the principle it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that a negro be not a man the foundation of his certainty be not that universal proposition which perhaps he never hear nor think of but the clear distinct perception he hath of his own simple ideas of black and white which he can not be persuade to take nor can ever mistake one for another whether he know that maxim or no and to this child or any one who hath such an idea which he call man can you never demonstrate that a man hath a soul because his idea of man include no such notion or idea in it and therefore to him the principle of what be be prove not this matter but it depend upon collection and observation by which he be to make his complex idea call man another instance secondly another that hath go further in frame and collect the idea he call man and to the outward shape add laughter and rational discourse may demonstrate that infants and changelings be no men by this maxim it be impossible for the same thing to he and not to be and i have discourse with very rational men who have actually deny that they be men a third instance thirdly perhaps another make up the complex idea which he call man only out of the ideas of body in general and the power of language and reason and leave out the shape wholly this man be able to demonstrate that a man may have no hand but be quadrupes neither of those be include in his idea of man and in whatever body or shape he find speech and reason join that be a man because have a clear knowledge of such a complex idea it be certain that what be be little use of these maxims in proof where we have clear and distinct ideas so that if rightly consider i think we may say that where our ideas be determine in our mind and have annex to them by us know and steady name under those settle determinations there be little need or no use at all of these maxims to prove the agreement or disagreement of any of them he that can not discern the truth or falsehood of such proposition without the help of these and the like maxims will not be help by these maxims to do it since he can not be suppose to know the truth of these maxims themselves without proof if he can not know the truth of others without proof which be as selfevident as these upon this grind it be that intuitive knowledge neither require nor admit any proof one part of it more than another he that will suppose it do take away the foundation of all knowledge and certainty and he that need any proof to make him certain and give his assent to this proposition that two be equal to two will also have need of a proof to make him admit that what be be he that need a probation to convince him that two be not three that white be not black that a triangle be not a circle c or any other two determine distinct ideas be not one and the same will need also a demonstration to convince him that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be their use dangerous where our ideas be not determine and as these maxims be of little use where we have determine ideas so they be as i have show of dangerous use where our ideas be not determine and where we use word that be not annex to determine ideas but such as be of a loose and wander signification sometimes stand for one and sometimes for another idea from which follow mistake and error which these maxims bring as proof to establish proposition wherein the term stand for undetermined ideas do by their authority confirm and rivet iii of trifle proposition some proposition bring no increase to our knowledge whether the maxims treat of in the forego chapter be of that use to real knowledge as be generally suppose i leave to be consider this i think may confidently be affirm that there be universal proposition which though they be certainly true yet they add no light to our understand bring no increase to our knowledge such be i as identical proposition first all purely identical proposition these obviously and at first blush appear to contain no instruction in them for when we affirm the say term of itself whether it be barely verbal or whether it contain any clear and real idea it show us nothing but what we must certainly know before whether such a proposition be either make by or propose to us indeed that most general one what be be may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he be guilty of when by circumlocution or equivocal term he would in particular instance deny the same thing of itself because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense as to affirm visible and direct contradictions in plain word or if he do a man be excuse if he break off any further discourse with him but yet i think i may say that neither that receive maxim nor any other identical proposition teach us anything and though in such kind of proposition this great and magnify maxim boast to be the foundation of demonstration may be and often be make use of to confirm them yet all it prove amount to no more than this that the same word may with great certainty be affirm of itself without any doubt of the truth of any such proposition and let me add also without any real knowledge examples for at this rate any very ignorant person who can but make a proposition and know what he mean when he say ay or no may make a million of proposition of whose truth he may be infallibly certain and yet not know one thing in the world thereby vg what be a soul be a soul or a soul be a soul a spirit be a spirit a fetiche be a fetiche c these all be equivalent to this proposition viz what be be ie what hath existence hath existence or who hath a soul hath a soul what be this more than trifle with word it be but like a monkey shift his oyster from one hand to the other and have he but word might no doubt have say oyster in right hand be subject and oyster in leave hand be predicate and so might have make a selfevident proposition of oyster ie oyster be oyster and yet with all this not have be one whit the wiser or more know and that way of handle the matter would much at once have satisfy the monkey hunger or a man understand and they would have improve in knowledge and bulk together how identical proposition be trifle i know there be some who because identical proposition be selfevident show a great concern for them and think they do great service to philosophy by cry them up as if in them be contain all knowledge and the understand be lead into all truth by them only i grant as forwardly as any one that they be all true and selfevident i grant further that the foundation of all our knowledge lie in the faculty we have of perceive the same idea to be the same and of discern it from those that be different as i have show in the forego chapter but how that vindicate the make use of identical proposition for the improvement of knowl edge from the imputation of trifle i do not see let any one repeat as often as he please that the will be the will or lay what stress on it he think fit of what use be this and an infinite the like proposition for the enlarge our knowledge let a man abound as much as the plenty of word which he have will permit in such proposition as these a law be a law and obligation be obligation right be right and wrong be wrong will these and the like ever help him to an acquaintance with ethics or instruct him or others in the knowledge of morality those who know not nor perhaps ever will know what be right and what be wrong nor the measure of them can with as much assurance make and infallibly know the truth of these and all such proposition as he that be best instruct in morality can do but what advance do such proposition give in the knowledge of anything necessary or useful for their conduct he would be think to do little less than trifle who for the enlighten the understand in any part of knowledge should be busy with identical proposition and insist on such maxims as these substance be substance and body be body a vacuum be a vacuum and a vortex be a vortex a centaur be a centaur and a chimera be a chimera c for these and all such be equally true equally certain and equally selfevident but yet they can not but be count trifle when make use of as principles of instruction and stress lay on them as help to knowledge since they teach nothing but what every one who be capable of discourse know without be tell viz that the same term be the same term and the same idea the same idea and upon this account it be that i formerly do and do still think the offer and inculcate such proposition in order to give the understand any new light or inlet into the knowledge of things no better than trifle instruction lie in something very different and he that would enlarge his own or anothers mind to truths he do not yet know must find out intermediate ideas and then lay them in such order one by another that the understand may see the agreement or disagreement of those in question proposition that do this be instructive but they be far from such as affirm the same term of itself which be no way to advance ones self or others in any sort of knowledge it no more help to that than it would help any one in his learn to read to have such proposition as these inculcate to himan a be an a and a b be a b which a man may know as well as any schoolmaster and yet never be able to read a word as long as he live nor do these or any such identical proposition help him one jot forward in the skill of read let him make what use of them he can if those who blame my call them trifle proposition have but read and be at the pain to understand what i have above writ in very plain english they could not but have see that by identical proposition i mean only such wherein the same term import the same idea be affirm of itself which i take to be the proper signification of identical proposition and concern all such i think i may continue safely to say that to propose them as instructive be no better than trifle for no one who have the use of reason can miss them where it be necessary they should be take notice of nor doubt of their truth when he do take notice of them but if men will call proposition identical wherein the same term be not affirm of itself whether they speak more properly than i others must judge this be certain all that they say of proposition that be not identical in my sense concern not me nor what i have say all that i have say relate to those proposition wherein the same term be affirm of itself and i would fain see an instance wherein any such can be make use of to the advantage and improvement of any ones knowledge instance of other kinds whatever use may be make of them concern not me as not be such as i call identical ii secondly proposition in which a part of any complex idea be predicate of the whole another sort of trifle proposition be when a part of the complex idea be predicate of the name of the whole a part of the definition of the word define such be all proposition wherein the genus be predicate of the species or more comprehensive of less comprehensive term for what information what knowledge carry this proposition in it viz lead be a metal to a man who know the complex idea the name lead stand for all the simple ideas that go to the complex one signify by the term metal be nothing but what he before comprehend and signify by the name lead indeed to a man that know the signification of the word metal and not of the word lead it be a shorter way to explain the signification of the word lead by say it be a metal which at once express several of its simple ideas than to enumerate them one by one tell him it be a body very heavy fusible and malleable as part of the definition of the term define alike trifle it be to predicate any other part of the definition of the term define or to affirm any one of the simple ideas of a complex one of the name of the whole complex idea as all gold be fusible for fusibility be one of the simple ideas that go to the make up the complex one the sound gold stand for what can it be but play with sound to affirm that of the name gold which be comprehend in its receive signification it would be think little better than ridiculous to affirm gravely as a truth of moment that gold be yellow and i see not how it be any jot more material to say it be fusible unless that quality be leave out of the complex idea of which the sound gold be the mark in ordinary speech what instruction can it carry with it to tell one that which he hath be tell already or he be suppose to know before for i be suppose to know the signification of the word another use to me or else he be to tell me and if i know that the name gold stand for this complex idea of body yellow heavy fusible malleable it will not much instruct me to put it solemnly afterwards in a proposition and gravely say all gold be fusible such proposition can only serve to show the disingenuity of one who will go from the definition of his own term by remind him sometimes of it but carry no knowledge with them but of the signification of word however certain they be instance man and palfrey every man be an animal or live body be as certain a proposition as can be but no more conduce to the knowledge of things than to say a palfrey be an amble horse or a neigh amble animal both be only about the signification of word and make me know but thisthat body sense and motion or power of sensation and move be three of those ideas that i always comprehend and signify by the word man and where they be not to be find together the name man belong not to that thing and so of the otherthat body sense and a certain way of go with a certain kind of voice be some of those ideas which i always comprehend and signify by the word palfrey and when they be not to be find together the name palfrey belong not to that thing it be just the same and to the same purpose when any term stand for any one or more of the simple ideas that altogether make up that complex idea which be call man be affirm of the term manvg suppose a roman signify by the word homo all these distinct ideas unite in one subject corporietas sensibilitas potentia se movendi rationalitas risibilitas he might no doubt with great certainty universally affirm one more or all of these together of the word homo but do no more than say that the word homo in his country comprehend in its signification all these ideas much like a romance knight who by the word palfrey signify these ideasbody of a certain figure fourlegged with sense motion amble neigh white use to have a woman on his backmight with the same certainty universally affirm also any or all of these of the word palfrey but do thereby teach no more but that the word palfrey in his or romance language stand for all these and be not to be apply to anything where any of these be want but he that shall tell me that in whatever thing sense motion reason and laughter be unite that thing have actually a notion of god or would be cast into a sleep by opium make indeed an instructive proposition because neither have the notion of god nor be cast into sleep by opium be contain in the idea signify by the word man we be by such proposition teach something more than barely what the word man stand for and therefore the knowledge contain in it be more than verbal for this teach but the signification of word before a man make any proposition he be suppose to understand the term he use in it or else he talk like a parrot only make a noise by imitation and frame certain sound which he have learn of others but not as a rational creature use them for sign of ideas which he have in his mind the hearer also be suppose to understand the term as the speaker use them or else he talk jargon and make an unintelligible noise and therefore he trifle with word who make such a proposition which when it be make contain no more than one of the term do and which a man be suppose to know before vg a triangle hath three side or saffron be yellow and this be no further tolerable than where a man go to explain his term to one who be suppose or declare himself not to understand him and then it teach only the signification of that word and the use of that sign but add no real knowledge we can know then the truth of two sort of proposition with perfect certainty the one be of those trifle proposition which have a certainty in them but it be only a verbal certainty but not instructive and secondly we can know the truth and so may be certain in proposition which affirm something of another which be a necessary consequence of its precise complex idea but not contain in it as that the external angle of all triangles be bigger than either of the opposite internal angle which relation of the outward angle to either of the opposite internal angle make no part of the complex idea signify by the name triangle this be a real truth and convey with it instructive real knowledge general proposition concern substances be often trifle we have little or no knowledge of what combinations there be of simple ideas exist together in substances but by our sense we can not make any universal certain proposition concern them any further than our nominal essences lead us which be to a very few and inconsiderable truths in respect of those which depend on their real constitutions the general proposition that be make about substances if they be certain be for the most part but trifle and if they be instructive be uncertain and such as we can have no knowledge of their real truth how much soever constant observation and analogy may assist our judgment in guess hence it come to pass that one may often meet with very clear and coherent discourse that amount yet to nothing for it be plain that name of substantial be as well as others as far as they have relative significations affix to them may with great truth be join negatively and affirmatively in proposition as their relative definitions make them fit to be so join and proposition consist of such term may with the same clearness be deduce one from another as those that convey the most real truths and all this without any knowledge of the nature or reality of things exist without us by this method one may make demonstrations and undoubted proposition in word and yet thereby advance not one jot in the knowledge of the truth of things vg he that have learn these follow word with their ordinary mutual relative acceptations annex to them vg substance man animal form soul vegetative sensitive rational may make several undoubted proposition about the soul without know at all what the soul really be and of this sort a man may find an infinite number of proposition reason and conclusions in book of metaphysics schooldivinity and some sort of natural philosophy and after all know as little of god spirit or body as he do before he set out and why he that hath liberty to define ie to determine the signification of his name of substances as certainly every one do in effect who make them stand for his own ideas and make their significations at a venture take them from his own or other mens fancy and not from an examination or inquiry into the nature of things themselves may with little trouble demonstrate them one of another accord to those several respect and mutual relations he have give them one to another wherein however things agree or disagree in their own nature he need mind nothing but his own notions with the name he hath bestow upon them but thereby no more increase in his own knowledge than he do his riches who take a bag of counter call one in a certain place a pound another in another place a shill and a third in a third place a penny and so proceed may undoubtedly reckon right and cast up a great sum accord to his counter so place and stand for more or less as he please without be one jot the richer or without even know how much a pound shill or penny be but only that one be contain in the other twenty time and contain the other twelve which a man may also do in the signification of word by make them in respect of one another more or less or equally comprehensive thirdly use word variously be trifle with them though yet concern most word use in discourse equally argumentative and controversial there be this more to be complain of which be the worst sort of trifle and which set us yet further from the certainty of knowledge we hope to attain by them or find in them viz that most writers be so far from instruct us in the nature and knowledge of things that they use their word loosely and uncertainly and do not by use them constantly and steadily in the same significations make plain and clear deductions of word one from another and make their discourse coherent and clear how little soever they be instructive which be not difficult to do do they not find it convenient to shelter their ignorance or obstinacy under the obscurity and perplexedness of their term to which perhaps inadvertency and ill custom do in many men much contribute mark of verbal proposition to conclude barely verbal proposition may be know by these follow mark predication in abstract first all proposition wherein two abstract term be affirm one of another be barely about the signification of sound for since no abstract idea can be the same with any other but itself when its abstract name be affirm of any other term it can signify no more but this that it may or ought to be call by that name or that these two name signify the same idea thus should any one say that parsimony be frugality that gratitude be justice that this or that action be or be not temperate however specious these and the like proposition may at first sight seem yet when we come to press them and examine nicely what they contain we shall find that it all amount to nothing but the signification of those term a part of the definition predicate of any term secondly all proposition wherein a part of the complex idea which any term stand for be predicate of that term be only verbal vg to say that gold be a metal or heavy and thus all proposition wherein more comprehensive word call genera be affirm of subordinate or less comprehensive call species or individuals be barely verbal when by these two rule we have examine the proposition that make up the discourse we ordinarily meet with both in and out of book we shall perhaps find that a greater part of them than be usually suspect be purely about the signification of word and contain nothing in them but the use and application of these sign this i think i may lay down for an infallible rule that wherever the distinct idea any word stand for be not know and consider and something not contain in the idea be not affirm or deny of it there our thoughts stick wholly in sound and be able to attain no real truth or falsehood this perhaps if well heed might save us a great deal of useless amusement and dispute and very much shorten our trouble and wander in the search of real and true knowledge of our threefold knowledge of existence general proposition that be certain concern not existence hitherto we have only consider the essences of things which be only abstract ideas and thereby remove in our thoughts from particular existence that be the proper operation of the mind in abstraction to consider an idea under no other existence but what it have in the understand give us no knowledge of real existence at all where by the way we may take notice that universal proposition of whose truth or falsehood we can have certain knowledge concern not existence and further that all particular affirmations or negations that would not be certain if they be make general be only concern existence they declare only the accidental union or separation of ideas in things exist which in their abstract natures have no know necessary union or repugnancy a threefold knowledge of existence but leave the nature of proposition and different ways of predication to be consider more at large in another place let us proceed now to inquire concern our knowledge of the existence of things and how we come by it i say then that we have the knowledge of our own existence by intuition of the existence of god by demonstration and of other things by sensation our knowledge of our own existence be intuitive as for our own existence we perceive it so plainly and so certainly that it neither need nor be capable of any proof for nothing can be more evident to us than our own existence i think i reason i feel pleasure and pain can any of these be more evident to me than my own existence if i doubt of all other things that very doubt make me perceive my own existence and will not suffer me to doubt of that for if i know i feel pain it be evident i have as certain perception of my own existence as of the existence of the pain i feel or if i know i doubt i have as certain perception of the existence of the thing doubt as of that think which i call doubt experience then convince us that we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and an internal infallible perception that we be in every act of sensation reason or think we be conscious to ourselves of our own be and in this matter come not short of the highest degree of certainty of our knowledge of the existence of a god we be capable of know certainly that there be a god though god have give us no innate ideas of himself though he have stamp no original character on our mind wherein we may read his be yet have furnish us with those faculties our mind be endow with he hath not leave himself without witness since we have sense perception and reason and can not want a clear proof of him as long as we carry ourselves about us nor can we justly complain of our ignorance in this great point since he have so plentifully provide us with the mean to discover and know him so far as be necessary to the end of our be and the great concernment of our happiness but though this be the most obvious truth that reason discover and though its evidence be if i mistake not equal to mathematical certainty yet it require think and attention and the mind must apply itself to a regular deduction of it from some part of our intuitive knowledge or else we shall be as uncertain and ignorant of this as of other proposition which be in themselves capable of clear demonstration to show therefore that we be capable of know ie be certain that there be a god and how we may come by this certainty i think we need go no further than ourselves and that undoubted knowledge we have of our own existence for man know that he himself exist i think it be beyond question that man have a clear idea of his own be he know certainly he exist and that he be something he that can doubt whether he be anything or no i speak not to no more than i would argue with pure nothing or endeavour to convince nonentity that it be something if any one pretend to be so sceptical as to deny his own existence for really to doubt of it be manifestly impossible let him for me enjoy his beloved happiness of be nothing until hunger or some other pain convince him of the contrary this then i think i may take for a truth which every ones certain knowledge assure him of beyond the liberty of doubt viz that he be something that actually exist he know also that nothing can not produce a be therefore something must have exist from eternity in the next place man know by an intuitive certainty that bare nothing can no more produce any real be than it can be equal to two right angle if a man know not that nonentity or the absence of all be can not be equal to two right angle it be impossible he should know any demonstration in euclid if therefore we know there be some real be and that nonentity can not produce any real be it be an evident demonstration that from eternity there have be something since what be not from eternity have a begin and what have a begin must be produce by something else and that eternal be must be most powerful next it be evident that what have its be and begin from another must also have all that which be in and belong to its be from another too all the power it have must be owe to and receive from the same source this eternal source then of all be must also be the source and original of all power and so this eternal be must be also the most powerful and most know again a man find in himself perception and knowledge we have then get one step further and we be certain now that there be not only some be but some know intelligent be in the world there be a time then when there be no know be and when knowledge begin to be or else there have be also a know be from eternity if it be say there be a time when no be have any knowledge when that eternal be be void of all understand i reply that then it be impossible there should ever have be any knowledge it be as impossible that things wholly void of knowledge and operate blindly and without any perception should produce a know be as it be impossible that a triangle should make itself three angle bigger than two right ones for it be as repugnant to the idea of senseless matter that it should put into itself sense perception and knowledge as it be repugnant to the idea of a triangle that it should put into itself greater angle than two right ones and therefore god thus from the consideration of ourselves and what we infallibly find in our own constitutions our reason lead us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truththat there be an eternal most powerful and most know be which whether any one will please to call god it matter not the thing be evident and from this idea duly consider will easily be deduce all those other attribute which we ought to ascribe to this eternal be if nevertheless any one should be find so senselessly arrogant as to suppose man alone know and wise but yet the product of mere ignorance and chance and that all the rest of the universe act only by that blind haphazard i shall leave with him that very rational and emphatical rebuke of tully i ii de leg to be consider at his leisure what can be more sillily arrogant and misbecoming than for a man to think that he have a mind and understand in him but yet in all the universe beside there be no such thing or that those things which with the utmost stretch of his reason he can scarce comprehend should be move and manage without any reason at all quid est enim verius quam neminem esse oportere tam stulte arrogantem ut in se mentem et rationem putet inesse in caelo mundoque non putet aut ea quae vix summa ingenii ratione comprehendat nulla ratione moveri putet from what have be say it be plain to me we have a more certain knowledge of the existence of a god than of anything our sense have not immediately discover to us nay i presume i may say that we more certainly know that there be a god than that there be anything else without us when i say we know i mean there be such a knowledge within our reach which we can not miss if we will but apply our mind to that as we do to several other inquiries our idea of a most perfect be not the sole proof of a god how far the idea of a most perfect be which a man may frame in his mind do or do not prove the existence of a god i will not here examine for in the different make of mens temper and application of their thoughts some arguments prevail more on one and some on another for the confirmation of the same truth but yet i think this i may say that it be an ill way of establish this truth and silence atheists to lay the whole stress of so important a point as this upon that sole foundation and take some mens have that idea of god in their mind for it be evident some men have none and some worse than none and the most very different for the only proof of a deity and out of an over fondness of that darling invention cashier or at least endeavour to invalidate all other arguments and forbid us to hearken to those proof as be weak or fallacious which our own existence and the sensible part of the universe offer so clearly and cogently to our thoughts that i deem it impossible for a consider man to withstand them for i judge it as certain and clear a truth as can anywhere be deliver that the invisible things of god be clearly see from the creation of the world be understand by the things that be make even his eternal power and godhead though our own be furnish us as i have show with an evident and incontestable proof of a deity and i believe nobody can avoid the cogency of it who will but as carefully attend to it as to any other demonstration of so many part yet this be so fundamental a truth and of that consequence that all religion and genuine morality depend thereon i doubt not but i shall be forgive by my reader if i go over some part of this argument again and enlarge a little more upon them recapitulationsomething from eternity there be no truth more evident than that something must be from eternity i never yet hear of any one so unreasonable or that could suppose so manifest a contradiction as a time wherein there be perfectly nothing this be of all absurdities the greatest to imagine that pure nothing the perfect negation and absence of all be should ever produce any real existence it be then unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude that something have exist from eternity let us next see what kind of thing that must be two sort of be cogitative and incogitative there be but two sort of be in the world that man know or conceive first such as be purely material without sense perception or think as the clippings of our beard and par of our nail secondly sensible think perceive be such as we find ourselves to be which if you please we will hereafter call cogitative and incogitative be which to our present purpose if for nothing else be perhaps better term than material and immaterial incogitative be can not produce a cogitative be if then there must be something eternal let us see what sort of be it must be and to that it be very obvious to reason that it must necessarily be a cogitative be for it be as impossible to conceive that ever bare incogitative matter should produce a think intelligent be as that nothing should of itself produce matter let us suppose any parcel of matter eternal great or small we shall find it in itself able to produce nothing for example let us suppose the matter of the next pebble we meet with eternal closely unite and the part firmly at rest together if there be no other be in the world must it not eternally remain so a dead inactive lump be it possible to conceive it can add motion to itself be purely matter or produce anything matter then by its own strength can not produce in itself so much as motion the motion it have must also be from eternity or else be produce and add to matter by some other be more powerful than matter matter as be evident have not power to produce motion in itself but let us suppose motion eternal too yet matter incogitative matter and motion whatever change it might produce of figure and bulk could never produce think knowledge will still be as far beyond the power of motion and matter to produce as matter be beyond the power of nothing or nonentity to produce and i appeal to every ones own thoughts whether he can not as easily conceive matter produce by nothing as think to be produce by pure matter when before there be no such thing as think or an intelligent be exist divide matter into as many part as you will which we be apt to imagine a sort of spiritualize or make a think thing of it vary the figure and motion of it as much as you pleasea globe cube cone prism cylinder c whose diameters be but th part of a gry will operate no otherwise upon other body of proportionable bulk than those of an inch or foot diameter and you may as rationally expect to produce sense think and knowledge by put together in a certain figure and motion gross particles of matter as by those that be the very minutest that do anywhere exist they knock impel and resist one another just as the greater do and that be all they can do so that if we will suppose nothing first or eternal matter can never begin to be if we suppose bare matter without motion eternal motion can never begin to be if we suppose only matter and motion first or eternal think can never begin to be for it be impossible to conceive that matter either with or without motion could have originally in and from itself sense perception and knowledge as be evident from hence that then sense perception and knowledge must be a property eternally inseparable from matter and every particle of it not to add that though our general or specific conception of matter make us speak of it as one thing yet really all matter be not one individual thing neither be there any such thing exist as one material be or one single body that we know or can conceive and therefore if matter be the eternal first cogitative be there would not be one eternal infinite cogitative be but an infinite number of eternal finite cogitative be independent one of another of limit force and distinct thoughts which could never produce that order harmony and beauty which be to be find in nature since therefore whatsoever be the first eternal be must necessarily be cogitative and whatsoever be first of all things must necessarily contain in it and actually have at least all the perfections that can ever after exist nor can it ever give to another any perfection that it hath not either actually in itself or at least in a higher degree it necessarily follow that the first eternal be can not be matter therefore there have be an eternal cogitative be if therefore it be evident that something necessarily must exist from eternity it be also as evident that that something must necessarily be a cogitative be for it be as impossible that incogitative matter should produce a cogitative be as that nothing or the negation of all be should produce a positive be or matter the attribute of the eternal cogitative be though this discovery of the necessary existence of an eternal mind do sufficiently lead us into the knowledge of god since it will hence follow that all other know be that have a begin must depend on him and have no other ways of knowledge or extent of power than what he give them and therefore if he make those he make also the less excellent piece of this universeall inanimate be whereby his omniscience power and providence will be establish and all his other attribute necessarily follow yet to clear up this a little further we will see what doubt can be raise against it whether the eternal mind may he also material or no first perhaps it will be say that though it be as clear as demonstration can make it that there must be an eternal be and that be must also be know yet it do not follow but that think be may also be material let it be so it equally still follow that there be a god for if there be an eternal omniscient omnipotent be it be certain that there be a god whether you imagine that be to be material or no but herein i suppose lie the danger and deceit of that suppositionthere be no way to avoid the demonstration that there be an eternal know be men devote to matter would willingly have it grant that this know be be material and then let slide out of their mind or the discourse the demonstration whereby an eternal know be be prove necessarily to exist would argue all to be matter and so deny a god that be an eternal cogitative be whereby they be so far from establish that they destroy their own hypothesis for if there can be in their opinion eternal matter without any eternal cogitative be they manifestly separate matter and think and suppose no necessary connexion of the one with the other and so establish the necessity of an eternal spirit but not of matter since it have be prove already that an eternal cogitative be be unavoidably to be grant now if think and matter may be separate the eternal existence of matter will not follow from the eternal existence of a cogitative be and they suppose it to no purpose not material first because each particle of matter be not cogitative but now let us see how they can satisfy themselves or others that this eternal think be be material i i would ask them whether they imagine that all matter every particle of matter think this i suppose they will scarce say since then there would be as many eternal think be as there be particles of matter and so an infinity of gods and yet if they will not allow matter as matter that be every particle of matter to be as well cogitative as extend they will have as hard a task to make out to their own reason a cogitative be out of incogitative particles as an extend be out of unextended part if i may so speak ii secondly because one particle alone of matter can not be cogitative if all matter do not think i next ask whether it be only one atom that do so this have as many absurdities as the other for then this atom of matter must be alone eternal or not if this alone be eternal then this alone by its powerful think or will make all the rest of matter and so we have the creation of matter by a powerful think which be that the materialists stick at for if they suppose one single think atom to have produce all the rest of matter they can not ascribe that preeminency to it upon any other account than that of its think the only suppose difference but allow it to be by some other way which be above our conception it must still be creation and these men must give up their great maxim ex nihilo nil fit if it be say that all the rest of matter be equally eternal as that think atom it will be to say anything at pleasure though ever so absurd for to suppose all matter eternal and yet one small particle in knowledge and power infinitely above all the rest be without any the least appearance of reason to frame an hypothesis every particle of matter as matter be capable of all the same figure and motion of any other and i challenge any one in his thoughts to add anything else to one above another iii thirdly because a system of incogitative matter can not be cogitative if then neither one peculiar atom alone can be this eternal think be nor all matter as matter ie every particle of matter can be it it only remain that it be some certain system of matter duly put together that be this think eternal be this be that which i imagine be that notion which men be aptest to have of god who would have him a material be as most readily suggest to them by the ordinary conceit they have of themselves and other men which they take to be material think be but this imagination however more natural be no less absurd than the other for to suppose the eternal think ing be to be nothing else but a composition of particles of matter each whereof be incogitative be to ascribe all the wisdom and knowledge of that eternal be only to the juxtaposition of part than which nothing can be more absurd for unthinking particles of matter however put together can have nothing thereby add to them but a new relation of position which it be impossible should give think and knowledge to them and that whether this corporeal system be in motion or at rest but further this corporeal system either have all its part at rest or it be a certain motion of the part wherein its think consist if it be perfectly at rest it be but one lump and so can have no privilege above one atom if it be the motion of its part on which its think depend all the thoughts there must be unavoidably accidental and limit since all the particles that by motion cause think be each of them in itself without any think can not regulate its own motion much less be regulate by the think of the whole since that think be not the cause of motion for then it must be antecedent to it and so without it but the consequence of it whereby freedom power choice and all rational and wise think or act will be quite take away so that such a think be will be no better nor wiser than pure blind matter since to resolve all into the accidental unguided motion of blind matter or into think depend on unguided motion of blind matter be the same thing not to mention the narrowness of such thoughts and knowledge that must depend on the motion of such part but there need no enumeration of any more absurdities and impossibilities in this hypothesis however full of them it be than that before mention since let this think system be all or a part of the matter of the universe it be impossible that any one particle should either know its own or the motion of any other particle or the whole know the motion of every particle and so regulate its own thoughts or motion or indeed have any think result from such motion matter not coeternal with an eternal mind secondly others would have matter to be eternal not withstand that they allow an eternal cogitative immaterial be this though it take not away the be of a god yet since it deny one and the first great piece of his workmanship the creation let us consider it a little matter must be allow eternal why because you can not conceive how it can be make out of nothing why do you not also think yourself eternal you will answer perhaps because about twenty or forty years since you begin to be but if i ask you what that you be which begin then to be you can scarce tell me the matter whereof you be make begin not then to be for if it do then it be not eternal but it begin to be put together in such a fashion and frame as make up your body but yet that frame of particles be not you it make not that think thing you be for i have now to do with one who allow an eternal immaterial think be but would have unthinking matter eternal too therefore when do that think thing begin to be if it do never begin to be then have you always be a think thing from eternity the absurdity whereof i need not confute till i meet with one who be so void of understand as to own it if therefore you can allow a think thing to be make out of nothing as all things that be not eternal must be why also can you not allow it possible for a material be to be make out of nothing by an equal power but that you have the experience of the one in view and not of the other though when well consider creation of a spirit will be find to require no less power than the creation of matter nay possibly if we would emancipate ourselves from vulgar notions and raise our thoughts as far as they would reach to a closer contemplation of things we might be able to aim at some dim and seem conception how matter might at first be make and begin to exist by the power of that eternal first be but to give begin and be to a spirit would be find a more inconceivable effect of omnipotent power but this be what would perhaps lead us too far from the notions on which the philosophy now in the world be build it would not be pardonable to deviate so far from them or to inquire so far as grammar itself would authorize if the common settle opinion oppose it especially in this place where the receive doctrine serve well enough to our present purpose and leave this past doubt that the creation or begin of any one substance out of nothing be once admit the creation of all other but the creator himself may with the same ease be suppose objection creation out of nothing but you will say be it not impossible to admit of the make anything out of nothing since we can not possibly conceive it i answer no because it be not reasonable to deny the power of an infinite be because we can not comprehend its operations we do not deny other effect upon this grind because we can not possibly conceive the manner of their production we can not conceive how anything but impulse of body can move body and yet that be not a reason sufficient to make us deny it possible against the constant experience we have of it in ourselves in all our voluntary motion which be produce in us only by the free action or think of our own mind and be not nor can be the effect of the impulse or determination of the motion of blind matter in or upon our own body for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter it for example my right hand write whilst my leave hand be still what cause rest in one and motion in the other nothing but my willa think of my mind my think only change the right hand rest and the leave hand move this be matter of fact which can not be deny explain this and make it intelligible and then the next step will be to understand creation for the give a new determination to the motion of the animal spirit which some make use of to explain voluntary motion clear not the difficulty one jot to alter the determination of motion be in this case no easier nor less than to give motion itself since the new determination give to the animal spirit must be either immediately by think or by some other body put in their way by think which be not in their way before and so must owe its motion to think either of which leave voluntary motion as unintelligible as it be before in the meantime it be an overvalue ourselves to reduce all to the narrow measure of our capacities and to conclude all things impos sible to be do whose manner of do exceed our comprehension this be to make our comprehension infinite or god finite when what he can do be limit to what we can conceive of it if you do not understand the operations of your own finite mind that think thing within you do not deem it strange that you can not comprehend the operations of that eternal infinite mind who make and govern all things and whom the heaven of heavens can not contain of our knowledge of the existence of other things knowledge of the existence of other finite be be to be have only by actual sensation the knowledge of our own be we have by intuition the existence of a god reason clearly make know to us as have be show the knowledge of the existence of any other thing we can have only by sensation for there be no necessary connexion of real existence with any idea a man hath in his memory nor of any other existence but that of god with the existence of any particular man no particular man can know the existence of any other be but only when by actual operate upon him it make itself perceive by him for the have the idea of anything in our mind no more prove the existence of that thing than the picture of a man evidence his be in the world or the visions of a dream make thereby a true history instance whiten of this paper it be therefore the actual receive of ideas from without that give us notice of the existence of other things and make us know that something doth exist at that time without us which cause that idea in us though perhaps we neither know nor consider how it do it for it take not from the certainty of our sense and the ideas we receive by them that we know not the manner wherein they be produce vg whilst i write this i have by the paper affect my eye that idea produce in my mind which whatever object cause i call white by which i know that that quality or accident ie whose appearance before my eye always cause that idea doth really exist and hath a be without me and of this the greatest assurance i can possibly have and to which my faculties can attain be the testimony of my eye which be the proper and sole judge of this thing whose testimony i have reason to rely on as so certain that i can no more doubt whilst i write this that i see white and black and that something really exist that cause that sensation in me than that i write or move my hand which be a certainty as great as human nature be capable of concern the existence of anything but a man self alone and of god this notice by our sense though not so certain as demonstration yet may be call knowledge and prove the existence of things without us the notice we have by our sense of the exist of things without us though it be not altogether so certain as our intuitive knowledge or the deductions of our reason employ about the clear abstract ideas of our own mind yet it be an assurance that deserve the name of knowledge if we persuade ourselves that our faculties act and inform us right concern the existence of those object that affect them it can not pass for an illgrounded confidence for i think nobody can in earnest be so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those things which he see and feel at least he that can doubt so far whatever he may have with his own thoughts will never have any controversy with me since he can never be sure i say anything contrary to his own opinion as to myself i think god have give me assurance enough of the existence of things without me since by their different application i can produce in myself both pleasure and pain which be one great concernment of my present state this be certain the confidence that our faculties do not herein deceive us be the greatest assurance we be capable of concern the existence of material be for we can not act anything but by our faculties nor talk of knowledge itself but by the help of those faculties which be fit to apprehend even what knowledge be but besides the assurance we have from our sense themselves that they do not err in the information they give us of the existence of things without us when they be affect by them we be further confirm in this assurance by other concurrent reason i confirm by concurrent reasonsfirst because we can not have ideas of sensation but by the inlet of the sense it be plain those perceptions be produce in us by exterior cause affect our sense because those that want the organs of any sense never can have the ideas belong to that sense produce in their mind this be too evident to be doubt and therefore we can not but be assure that they come in by the organs of that sense and no other way the organs themselves it be plain do not produce them for then the eye of a man in the dark would produce colour and his nose smell roses in the winter but we see nobody get the relish of a pineapple till he go to the indies where it be and taste it ii secondly because we find that an idea from actual sensation and another from memory be very distinct perceptions because sometimes i find that i can not avoid the have those ideas produce in my mind for though when my eye be shut or windows fast i can at pleasure recall to my mind the ideas of light or the sun which former sensations have lodge in my memory so i can at pleasure lay by that idea and take into my view that of the smell of a rise or taste of sugar but if i turn my eye at noon towards the sun i can not avoid the ideas which the light or sun then produce in me so that there be a manifest difference between the ideas lay up in my memory over which if they be there only i should have constantly the same power to dispose of them and lay them by at pleasure and those which force themselves upon me and i can not avoid have and therefore it must need be some exterior cause and the brisk act of some object without me whose efficacy i can not resist that produce those ideas in my mind whether i will or no besides there be nobody who doth not perceive the difference in himself between contemplate the sun as he hath the idea of it in his memory and actually look upon it of which two his perception be so distinct that few of his ideas be more distinguishable one from another and therefore he hath certain knowledge that they be not both memory or the action of his mind and fancy only within him but that actual see hath a cause without iii thirdly because pleasure or pain which accompany actual sensation accompany not the return of those ideas without the external object add to this that many of those ideas be produce in us with pain which afterwards we remember without the least offence thus the pain of heat or cold when the idea of it be revive in our mind give us no disturbance which when felt be very troublesome and be again when actually repeat which be occasion by the disorder the external object cause in our body when apply to them and we remember the pain of hunger thirst or the headache without any pain at all which would either never disturb us or else constantly do it as often as we think of it be there nothing more but ideas float in our mind and appearances entertain our fancy without the real existence of things affect us from abroad the same may be say of pleasure accompany several actual sensations and though mathematical demonstration depend not upon sense yet the examine them by diagram give great credit to the evidence of our sight and seem to give it a certainty approach to that of demonstration itself for it would be very strange that a man should allow it for an undeniable truth that two angle of a figure which he measure by line and angle of a diagram should be bigger one than the other and yet doubt of the existence of those line and angle which by look on he make use of to measure that by iv fourthly because our sense assist one anothers testimony of the existence of outward things and enable us to predict our sense in many case bear witness to the truth of each others report concern the existence of sensible things without us he that see a fire may if he doubt whether it be anything more than a bare fancy feel it too and be convince by put his hand in it which certainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or phantom unless that the pain be a fancy too which yet he can not when the burn be well by raise the idea of it bring upon himself again thus i see whilst i write this i can change the appearance of the paper and by design the letter tell beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment by barely draw my pen over it which will neither appear let me fancy as much as i will if my hand stand still or though i move my pen if my eye be shut nor when those character be once make on the paper can i choose afterwards but see them as they be that be have the ideas of such letter as i have make whence it be manifest that they be not barely the sport and play of my own imagination when i find that the character that be make at the pleasure of my own thoughts do not obey them nor yet cease to be whenever i shall fancy it but continue to affect my sense constantly and regularly accord to the figure i make them to which if we will add that the sight of those shall from another man draw such sound as i beforehand design they shall stand for there will be little reason leave to doubt that those word i write do really exist without me when they cause a long series of regular sound to affect my ears which could not be the effect of my imagination nor could my memory retain them in that order this certainty be as great as our condition need but yet if after all this any one will be so sceptical as to distrust his sense and to affirm that all we see and hear feel and taste think and do during our whole be be but the series and delude appearances of a long dream whereof there be no reality and therefore will question the existence of all things or our knowledge of anything i must desire him to consider that if all be a dream then he doth but dream that he make the question and so it be not much matter that a wake man should answer him but yet if he please he may dream that i make him this answer that the certainty of things exist in rerum natura when we have the testimony of our sense for it be not only as great as our frame can attain to but as our condition need for our faculties be suit not to the full extent of be nor to a perfect clear comprehensive knowledge of things free from all doubt and scruple but to the preservation of us in whom they be and accommodate to the use of life they serve to our purpose wen enough if they will but give us certain notice of those things which be convenient or inconvenient to us for he that see a candle burn and hath experiment the force of its flame by put his finger in it will little doubt that this be something exist without him which do him harm and put him to great pain which be assurance enough when no man require greater certainty to govern his action by than what be as certain as his action themselves and if our dreamer please to try whether the glow heat of a glass furnace be barely a wander imagination in a drowsy man fancy by put his hand into it he may perhaps be waken into a certainty greater than he could wish that it be something more than bare imagination so that this evidence be as great as we can desire be as certain to us as our pleasure or pain ie happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment either of know or be such an assurance of the existence of things without us be sufficient to direct us in the attain the good and avoid the evil which be cause by them which be the important concernment we have of be make acquaint with them but reach no further than actual sensation in fine then when our sense do actually convey into our understand any idea we can not but be satisfy that there doth something at that time really exist without us which doth affect our sense and by them give notice of itself to our apprehensive faculties and actually produce that idea which we then perceive and we can not so far distrust their testimony as to doubt that such collections of simple ideas as we have observe by our sense to be unite together do really exist together but this knowledge extend as far as the present testimony of our sense employ about particular object that do then affect them and no further for if i saw such a collection of simple ideas as be wont to be call man exist together one minute since and be now alone i can not be certain that the same man exist now since there be no necessary connexion of his exist ence a minute since with his existence now by a thousand ways he may cease to be since i have the testimony of my sense for his existence and if i can not be certain that the man i saw last today be now in be i can less be certain that he be so who hath be longer remove from my sense and i have not see since yesterday or since the last year and much less can i be certain of the existence of men that i never saw and therefore though it be highly probable that millions of men do now exist yet whilst i be alone write this i have not that certainty of it which we strictly call knowledge though the great likelihood of it put me past doubt and it be reasonable for me to do several things upon the confidence that there be men and men also of my acquaintance with whom i have to do now in the world but this be but probability not knowledge folly to expect demonstration in everything whereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it be for a man of a narrow knowledge who have reason give him to judge of the different evidence and probability of things and to be sway accordingly how vain i say it be to expect demonstration and certainty in things not capable of it and refuse assent to very rational proposition and act contrary to very plain and clear truths because they can not be make out so evident as to surmount every the least i will not say reason but pretence of doubt he that in the ordinary affairs of life would admit of nothing but direct plain demonstration would be sure of nothing in this world but of perish quickly the wholesomeness of his meat or drink would not give him reason to venture on it and i would fain know what it be he could do upon such ground as be capable of no doubt no objection past existence of other things be know by memory as when our sense be actually employ about any object we do know that it do exist so by our memory we may be assure that heretofore things that affect our sense have exist and thus we have knowledge of the past existence of several things whereof our sense have inform us our memories still retain the ideas and of this we be past all doubt so long as we remember well but this knowledge also reach no further than our sense have formerly assure us thus see water at this instant it be an unquestionable truth to me that water doth exist and remember that i saw it yesterday it will also be always true and as long as my memory retain it always an undoubted proposition to me that water do exist the th of july as it will also be equally true that a certain number of very fine colour do exist which at the same time i saw upon a bubble of that water but be now quite out of sight both of the water and bubble too it be no more certainly know to me that the water doth now exist than that the bubble or colour therein do so it be no more necessary that water should exist today because it exist yesterday than that the colour or bubble exist today because they exist yesterday though it be exceedingly much more probable because water hath be observe to continue long in existence but bubble and the colour on them quickly cease to be the existence of other finite spirit not knowable and rest on faith what ideas we have of spirit and how we come by them i have already show but though we have those ideas in our mind and know we have them there the have the ideas of spirit do not make us know that any such things do exist without us or that there be any finite spirit or any other spiritual be but the eternal god we have grind from revelation and several other reason to believe with assurance that there be such creatures but our sense not be able to discover them we want the mean of know their particular existences for we can no more know that there be finite spirit really exist by the idea we have of such be in our mind than by the ideas any one have of fairies or centaurs he can come to know that things answer those ideas do really exist and therefore concern the existence of finite spirit as well as several other things we must content ourselves with the evidence of faith but universal certain proposition concern this matter be beyond our reach for however true it may be vg that all the intelligent spirit that god ever create do still exist yet it can never make a part of our certain knowledge these and the like proposition we may assent to as highly probable but be not i fear in this state capable of know we be not then to put others upon demonstrate nor ourselves upon search of universal certainty in all those matter wherein we be not capable of any other knowledge but what our sense give us in this or that particular only particular proposition concern concrete existences be knowable by which it appear that there be two sort of proposition there be one sort of proposition concern the existence of anything answerable to such an idea as have the idea of an elephant phoenix motion or an angel in my mind the first and natural inquiry be whether such a thing do anywhere exist and this knowledge be only of particulars no existence of anything without us but only of god can certainly be know further than our sense inform us there be another sort of proposition wherein be express the agreement or disagreement of our abstract ideas and their dependence on one another such proposition may be universal and certain so have the idea of god and myself of fear and obedience i can not but be sure that god be to be fear and obey by me and this proposition will be certain concern man in general if i have make an abstract idea of such a species whereof i be one particular but yet this proposition how certain soever that men ought to fear and obey god prove not to me the existence of men in the world but will be true of all such creatures whenever they do exist which certainty of such general proposition depend on the agreement or disagreement to be discover in those abstract ideas and all general proposition that be know to be true concern abstract ideas in the former case our knowledge be the consequence of the existence of things produce ideas in our mind by our sense in the latter knowledge be the consequence of the ideas be they what they will that be in our mind produce there general certain proposition many of these be call aeternae veritates and all of them indeed be so not from be write all or any of them in the mind of all men or that they be any of them proposition in any ones mind till he have get the abstract ideas join or separate them by affirmation or negation but wheresoever we can suppose such a creature as man be endow with such faculties and thereby furnish with such ideas as we have we must conclude he must need when he apply his thoughts to the consideration of his ideas know the truth of certain proposition that will arise from the agreement or disagreement which he will perceive in his own ideas such proposition be therefore call eternal truths not because they be eternal proposition actually form and antecedent to the understand that at any time make them nor because they be imprint on the mind from any pattern that be anywhere out of the mind and exist before but because be once make about abstract ideas so as to be true they will whenever they can be suppose to be make again at any time past or to come by a mind have those ideas always actually be true for name be suppose to stand perpetually for the same ideas and the same ideas have immutably the same habitudes one to another proposition concern any abstract ideas that be once true must need be eternal verities of the improvement of our knowledge knowledge be not get from maxims it have be the common receive opinion amongst men of letter that maxims be the foundation of all knowledge and that the sciences be each of them build upon certain praecognita from whence the understand be to take its rise and by which it be to conduct itself in its inquiries into the matter belong to that science the beat road of the school have be to lay down in the begin one or more general proposition as foundations whereon to build the knowledge that be to be have of that subject these doctrines thus lay down for foundations of any science be call principles as the beginnings from which we must set out and look no further backwards in our inquiries as we have already observe the occasion of that opinion one thing which might probably give an occasion to this way of proceed in other sciences be as i suppose the good suc cess it seem to have in mathematics wherein men be observe to attain a great certainty of knowledge these sciences come by preeminence to be call mathemata and mathesis learn or things learn thoroughly learn as have of all others the greatest certainty clearness and evidence in them but from compare clear and distinct ideas but if any one will consider he will i guess find that the great advancement and certainty of real knowledge which men arrive to in these sciences be not owe to the influence of these principles nor derive from any peculiar advantage they receive from two or three general maxims lay down in the begin but from the clear distinct complete ideas their thoughts be employ about and the relation of equality and excess so clear between some of them that they have an intuitive knowledge and by that a way to discover it in others and this without the help of those maxims for i ask be it not possible for a young lad to know that his whole body be bigger than his little finger but by virtue of this axiom that the whole be bigger than a part nor be assure of it till he have learn that maxim or can not a country wench know that have receive a shill from one that owe her three and a shill also from another that owe her three the remain debts in each of their hand be equal can not she know this i say unless she fetch the certainty of it from this maxim that if you take equal from equal the remainder will be equal a maxim which possibly she never hear or think of i desire any one to consider from what have be elsewhere say which be know first and clearest by most people the particular instance or the general rule and which it be that give life and birth to the other these general rule be but the compare our more general and abstract ideas which be the workmanship of the mind make and name give to them for the easier dispatch in its reason and draw into comprehensive term and short rule its various and multiply observations but knowledge begin in the mind and be found on particulars though afterwards perhaps no notice be take thereof it be natural for the mind forward still to enlarge its knowl edge most attentively to lay up those general notions and make the proper use of them which be to disburden the memory of the cumbersome load of particulars for i desire it may be consider what more certainty there be to a child or any one that his body little finger and all be bigger than his little finger alone after you have give to his body the name whole and to his little finger the name part than he could have have before or what new knowledge concern his body can these two relative term give him which he could not have without them could he not know that his body be bigger than his little finger if his language be yet so imperfect that he have no such relative term as whole and part i ask further when he have get these name how be he more certain that his body be a whole and his little finger a part than he be or might be certain before he learn those term that his body be bigger than his little finger any one may as reasonably doubt or deny that his little finger be a part of his body as that it be less than his body and he that can doubt whether it be less will as certainly doubt whether it be a part so that the maxim the whole be bigger than a part can never be make use of to prove the little finger less than the body but when it be useless by be bring to convince one of a truth which he know already for he that do not certainly know that any parcel of matter with another parcel of matter join to it be bigger than either of them alone will never be able to know it by the help of these two relative term whole and part make of them what maxim you please dangerous to build upon precarious principles but be it in the mathematics as it will whether it be clearer that take an inch from a black line of two inch and an inch from a red line of two inch the remain part of the two line will be equal or that if you take equal from equal the remainder will be equal which i say of these two be the clearer and first know i leave to any one to determine it not be material to my present occasion that which i have here to do be to inquire whether if it be the readiest way to knowledge to begin with general maxims and build upon them it be yet a safe way to take the principles which be lay down in any other science as unquestionable truths and so receive them without examination and adhere to them without suffer them to be doubt of because mathematicians have be so happy or so fair to use none but selfevident and undeniable if this be so i know not what may not pass for truth in morality what may not be introduce and prove in natural philosophy let that principle of some of the old philosophers that all be matter and that there be nothing else be receive for certain and indubitable and it will be easy to be see by the write of some that have revive it again in our days what consequences it will lead us into let any one with polemo take the world or with the stoics the aether or the sun or with anaximenes the air to be god and what a divinity religion and worship must we need have nothing can be so dangerous as principles thus take up without question or examination especially if they be such as concern morality which influence mens live and give a bias to all their action who might not justly expect another kind of life in aristippus who place happiness in bodily pleasure and in antisthenes who make virtue sufficient to felicity and he who with plato shall place beatitude in the knowledge of god will have his thoughts raise to other contemplations than those who look not beyond this spot of earth and those perish things which be to be have in it he that with archelaus shall lay it down as a principle that right and wrong honest and dishonest be define only by laws and not by nature will have other measure of moral rectitude and pravity than those who take it for grant that we be under obligations antecedent to all human constitutions to do so be no certain way to truth if therefore those that pass for principles be not certain which we must have some way to know that we may be able to distinguish them from those that be doubtful but be only make so to us by our blind assent we be liable to be mislead by them and instead of be guide into truth we shall by principles be only confirm in mistake and error but to compare clear complete ideas under steady name but since the knowledge of the certainty of prin ciples as well as of all other truths depend only upon the perception we have of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas the way to improve our knowledge be not i be sure blindly and with an implicit faith to receive and swallow principles but be i think to get and fix in our mind clear distinct and complete ideas as far as they be to be have and annex to them proper and constant name and thus perhaps without any other principles but barely consider those perfect ideas and by compare them one with another find their agreement and disagreement and their several relations and habitudes we shall get more true and clear knowledge by the conduct of this one rule than by take up principles and thereby put our mind into the disposal of others the true method of advance knowledge be by consider our abstract ideas we must therefore if we will proceed as reason advise adapt our methods of inquiry to the nature of the ideas we examine and the truth we search after general and certain truths be only found in the habitudes and relations of abstract ideas a sagacious and methodical application of our thoughts for the find out these relations be the only way to discover all that can be put with truth and certainty concern them into general proposition by what step we be to proceed in these be to be learn in the school of the mathematicians who from very plain and easy beginnings by gentle degrees and a continue chain of reason proceed to the discovery and demonstration of truths that appear at first sight beyond human capacity the art of find proof and the admirable methods they have invent for the single out and lay in order those intermediate ideas that demonstratively show the equality or inequality of unapplicable quantities be that which have carry them so far and produce such wonderful and unexpected discoveries but whether something like this in respect of other ideas as well as those of magnitude may not in time be find out i will not determine this i think i may say that if other ideas that be the real as well as nominal essences of their species be pursue in the way familiar to mathematicians they would carry our thoughts further and with greater evidence and clearness than possibly we be apt to imagine by which morality also may he make clearer this give me the confidence to advance that conjecture which i suggest chap iii viz that morality be capable of demonstration as well as mathematics for the ideas that ethics be conversant about be all real essences and such as i imagine have a discoverable connexion and agreement one with another so far as we can find their habitudes and relations so far we shall be possess of certain real and general truths and i doubt not but if a right method be take a great part of morality might be make out with that clearness that could leave to a consider man no more reason to doubt than he could have to doubt of the truth of proposition in mathematics which have be demonstrate to him our knowledge of substances be to be improve not by contemplation of abstract ideas but only by experience in our search after the knowledge of substances our want of ideas that be suitable to such a way of proceed oblige us to a quite different method we advance not here as in the other where our abstract ideas be real as well as nominal essences by contemplate our ideas and consider their relations and correspondences that help us very little for the reason that in another place we have at large set down by which i think it be evident that substances afford matter of very little general knowledge and the bare contemplation of their abstract ideas will carry us but a very little way in the search of truth and certainty what then be we to do for the improvement of our knowledge in substantial be here we be to take a quite contrary course the want of ideas of their real essences send us from our own thoughts to the things themselves as they exist experience here must teach me what reason can not and it be by try alone that i can certainly know what other qualities coexist with those of my complex idea vg whether that yellow heavy fusible body i call gold be malleable or no which experience which way ever it prove in that particular body i examine make me not certain that it be so in all or any other yellow heavy fusible body but that which i have try because it be no consequence one way or the other from my complex idea the necessity or inconsistence of malleability hath no visible connexion with the combination of that colour weight and fusibility in any body what i have say here of the nominal essence of gold suppose to consist of a body of such a determinate colour weight and fusibility will hold true if malleableness fixedness and solubility in aqua regia be add to it our reason from these ideas will carry us but a little way in the certain discovery of the other properties in those mass of matter wherein all these be to be find because the other properties of such body depend not on these but on that unknown real essence on which these also depend we can not by them discover the rest we can go no further than the simple ideas of our nominal essence will carry us which be very little beyond themselves and so afford us but very sparingly any certain universal and useful truths for upon trial have find that particular piece and all others of that colour weight and fusibility that i ever try malleable that also make now perhaps a part of my complex idea part of my nominal essence of gold whereby though i make my complex idea to which i affix the name gold to consist of more simple ideas than before yet still it not contain the real essence of any species of body it help me not certainly to know i say to know perhaps it may be to conjecture the other remain properties of that body further than they have a visible connexion with some or all of the simple ideas that make up my nominal essence for example i can not be certain from this complex idea whether gold be fix or no because as before there be no necessary connexion or inconsistence to be discover betwixt a complex idea of a body yellow heavy fusible malleable betwixt these i say and fixedness so that i may certainly know that in whatsoever body these be find there fixedness be sure to be here again for assurance i must apply myself to experience as far as that reach i may have certain knowledge but no further experience may procure us convenience not science i deny not but a man accustom to rational and regular experiment shall be able to see further into the nature of body and guess righter at their yet unknown properties than one that be a stranger to them but yet as i have say this be but judgment and opinion not knowledge and certainty this way of get and improve our knowledge in substances only by experience and history which be all that the weakness of our faculties in this state of mediocrity which we be in in this world can attain to make me suspect that natural philosophy be not capable of be make a science we be able i imagine to reach very little general knowledge concern the species of body and their several properties experiment and historical observations we may have from which we may draw advantage of ease and health and thereby increase our stock of conveniences for this life but beyond this i fear our talents reach not nor be our faculties as i guess able to advance we be fit for moral science but only for probable interpretations of external nature from whence it be obvious to conclude that since our faculties be not fit to penetrate into the internal fabric and real essences of body but yet plainly discover to us the be of a god and the knowledge of ourselves enough to lead us into a full and clear discovery of our duty and great concernment it will become us as rational creatures to employ those faculties we have about what they be most adapt to and follow the direction of nature where it seem to point us out the way for it be rational to conclude that our proper employment lie in those inquiries and in that sort of knowledge which be most suit to our natural capacities and carry in it our greatest interest ie the condition of our eternal estate hence i think i may conclude that morality be the proper science and business of mankind in general who be both concern and fit to search out their summum bonum as several arts conversant about several part of nature be the lot and private talent of particular men for the common use of human life and their own particular subsistence in this world of what consequence the discovery of one natural body and its properties may be to human life the whole great continent of america be a convince instance whose igno rance in useful arts and want of the greatest part of the conveniences of life in a country that abound with all sort of natural plenty i think may be attribute to their ignorance of what be to be find in a very ordinary despicable stone i mean the mineral of iron and whatever we think of our part or improvements in this part of the world where knowledge and plenty seem to vie with each other yet to any one that will seriously reflect on it i suppose it will appear past doubt that be the use of iron lose among us we should in a few age be unavoidably reduce to the want and ignorance of the ancient savage americans whose natural endowments and provision come no way short of those of the most flourish and polite nations so that he who first make know the use of that contemptible mineral may be truly style the father of arts and author of plenty in the study of nature we must beware of hypotheses and wrong principles i would not therefore be think to disesteem or dissuade the study of nature i readily agree the contemplation of his work give us occasion to admire revere and glorify their author and if rightly direct may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary charity that have at so great charge be raise by the founder of hospitals and almshouses he that first invent print discover the use of the compass or make public the virture and right use of kin kina do more for the propagation of knowledge for the supply and increase of useful commodities and save more from the grave than those who build colleges workhouses and hospitals all that i would say be that we should not be too forwardly possess with the opinion or expectation of knowledge where it be not to be have or by ways that will not attain to it that we should not take doubtful systems for complete sciences nor unintelligible notions for scientifical demonstrations in the knowledge of body we must be content to glean what we can from particular experiment since we can not from a discovery of their real essences grasp at a time whole sheaves and in bundle comprehend the nature and properties of whole species together where our inquiry be con cerning coexistence or repugnancy to coexist which by contemplation of our ideas we can not discover there experience observation and natural history must give us by our sense and by retail an insight into corporeal substances the knowledge of body we must get by our sense warily employ in take notice of their qualities and operations on one another and what we hope to know of separate spirit in this world we must i think expect only from revelation he that shall consider how little general maxims precarious principles and hypotheses lay down at pleasure have promote true knowledge or help to satisfy the inquiries of rational men after real improvements how little i say the set out at that end have for many age together advance mens progress towards the knowledge of natural philosophy will think we have reason to thank those who in this latter age have take another course and have tread out to us though not an easier way to learn ignorance yet a surer way to profitable knowledge the true use of hypotheses not that we may not to explain any phenomena of nature make use of any probable hypotheses whatsoever hypotheses if they be well make be at least great help to the memory and often direct us to new discoveries but my mean be that we should not take up any one too hastily which the mind that would always penetrate into the cause of things and have principles to rest on be very apt to do till we have very well examine particulars and make several experiment in that thing which we would explain by our hypothesis and see whether it will agree to them all whether our principles will carry us quite through and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature as they seem to accommodate and explain another and at least that we take care that the name of principles deceive us not nor impose on us by make us receive that for an unquestionable truth which be really at best but a very doubtful conjecture such as be most i have almost say all of the hypotheses in natural philosophy clear and distinct ideas with settle name and the find of those intermediate ideas which show their agreement or disagreement be the ways to enlarge our knowledge but whether natural philosophy be capable of certainty or no the ways to enlarge our knowledge as far as we be capable seem to me in short to be these two first the first be to get and settle in our mind determine ideas of those things whereof we have general or specific name at least so many of them as we would consider and improve our knowledge in or reason about and if they be specific ideas of substances we should endeavour also to make them as complete as we can whereby i mean that we should put together as many simple ideas as be constantly observe to coexist may perfectly determine the species and each of those simple ideas which be the ingredients of our complex ones should be clear and distinct in our mind for it be evident that our knowledge can not exceed our ideas as far as they be either imperfect confuse or obscure we can not expect to have certain perfect or clear knowledge secondly the other be the art of find out those intermediate ideas which may show us the agreement or repugnancy of other ideas which can not be immediately compare mathematics an instance of this that these two and not the rely on maxims and draw consequences from some general proposition be the right methods of improve our knowledge in the ideas of other modes besides those of quantity the consideration of mathematical knowledge will easily inform us where first we shall find that he that have not a perfect and clear idea of those angle or figure of which he desire to know anything be utterly thereby incapable of any knowledge about them suppose but a man not to have a perfect exact idea of a right angle a scalenum or trapezium and there be nothing more certain than that he will in vain seek any demonstration about them further it be evident that it be not the influence of those maxims which be take for principles in mathematics that hath lead the master of that science into those wonderful discoveries they have make let a man of good part know all the maxims generally make use of in mathematics ever so perfectly and contemplate their extent and consequences as much as he please he will by their assistance i suppose scarce ever come to know that the square of the hypothenuse in a rightangled triangle be equal to the square of the two other side the knowledge that the whole be equal to all its part and if you take equal from equal the remainder will be equal c help him not i presume to this demonstration and a man may i think pore long enough on those axioms without ever see one jot the more of mathematical truths they have be discover by the thoughts otherwise apply the mind have other object other view before it far different from those maxims when it first get the knowledge of such truths in mathematics which men well enough acquaint with those receive axioms but ignorant of their method who first make these demonstrations can never sufficiently admire and who know what methods to enlarge our knowledge in other part of science may hereafter be invent answer that of algebra in mathematics which so readily find out the ideas of quantities to measure others by whose equality or proportion we could otherwise very hardly or perhaps never come to know some further considerations concern our knowledge our knowledge partly necessary partly voluntary our knowledge as in other things so in this have so great a conformity with our sight that it be neither wholly necessary nor wholly voluntary if our knowledge be altogether necessary all mens knowledge would not only be alike but every man would know all that be knowable and if it be wholly voluntary some men so little regard or value it that they would have extreme little or none at all men that have sense can not choose but receive some ideas by them and if they have memory they can not but retain some of them and if they have memory they can not but retain some of them and if they have any distinguish faculty can not but perceive the agreement or disagreement of some of them one with another as he that have eye if he will open them by day can not but see some object and perceive a difference in them but though a man with his eye open in the light can not but see yet there be certain object which he may choose whether he will turn his eye to there may be in his reach a book contain picture and discourse capable to delight or instruct him which yet he may never have the will to open never take the pain to look into the application of our faculties voluntary but they be employ we know as things be not as we please there be also another thing in a man power and that be though he turn his eye sometimes towards an object yet he may choose whether he will curiously survey it and with an intent application endeavour to observe accurately all that be visible in it but yet what he do see he can not see otherwise than he do it depend not on his will to see that black which appear yellow nor to persuade himself that what actually scald him feel cold the earth will not appear paint with flower nor the field cover with verdure whenever he have a mind to it in the cold winter he can not help see it white and hoary if he will look abroad just thus be it with our understand all that be voluntary in our knowledge be the employ or withhold any of our faculties from this or that sort of object and a more or less accurate survey of them but they be employ our will hath no power to determine the knowledge of the mind one way or another that be do only by the object themselves as far as they be clearly discover and therefore as far as mens sense be conversant about external object the mind can not but receive those ideas which be present by them and be inform of the existence of things without and so far as mens thoughts converse with their own determine ideas they can not but in some measure observe the agreement or disagreement that be to be find amongst some of them which be so far knowledge and if they have name for those ideas which they have thus consider they must need be assure of the truth of those proposition which express that agreement or disagreement they perceive in them and be undoubtedly con vinced of those truths for what a man see he can not but see and what he perceive he can not but know that he perceive instance in number thus he that have get the ideas of number and hath take the pain to compare one two and three to six can not choose but know that they be equal he that hath get the idea of a triangle and find the ways to measure its angle and their magnitudes be certain that its three angle be equal to two right ones and can as little doubt of that as of this truth that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be instance in natural religion he also that hath the idea of an intelligent but frail and weak be make by and depend on another who be eternal omnipotent perfectly wise and good will as certainly know that man be to honour fear and obey god as that the sun shin when he see it for if he hath but the ideas of two such be in his mind and will turn his thoughts that way and consider them he will as certainly find that the inferior finite and dependent be under an obligation to obey the supreme and infinite as he be certain to find that three four and seven be less than fifteen if he will consider and compute those number nor can he be surer in a clear morning that the sun be rise if he will but open his eye and turn them that way but yet these truths be ever so certain ever so clear he may be ignorant of either or all of them who will never take the pain to employ his faculties as he should to inform himself about them of judgment our knowledge be short we want something else the understand faculties be give to man not barely for speculation but also for the conduct of his life man would be at a great loss if he have nothing to direct him but what have the certainty of true knowledge for that be very short and scanty as we have see he would be often utterly in the dark and in most of the action of his life perfectly at a stand have he nothing to guide him in the absence of clear and certain knowledge he that will not eat till he have demonstration that it will nourish him he that will not stir till he infallibly know the business he go about will succeed will have little else to do but to sit still and perish what use to be make of this twilight state therefore as god have set some things in broad daylight as he have give us some certain knowledge though limit to a few things in comparison probably as a taste of what intellectual creatures be capable of to excite in us a desire and endeavour after a better state so in the greatest part of our concernments he have afford us only the twilight as i may so say of probability suitable i presume to that state of mediocrity and probationership he have be please to place us in here wherein to check our overconfidence and presumption we might by every days experience be make sensible of our shortsightedness and liableness to error the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to us to spend the days of this our pilgrimage with industry and care in the search and follow of that way which might lead us to a state of greater perfection it be highly rational to think even be revelation silent in the case that as men employ those talents god have give them here they shall accordingly receive their reward at the close of the day when their sun shall set and night shall put an end to their labour judgment or assent to probability supply our want of knowledge the faculty which god have give man to supply the want of clear and certain knowledge in case where that can not be have be judgment whereby the mind take its ideas to agree or disagree or which be the same any proposition to be true or false without perceive a demonstrative evidence in the proof the mind sometimes exercise this judgment out of necessity where demonstrative proof and certain knowledge be not to be have and sometimes out of laziness unskilfulness or haste even where demonstrative and certain proof be to be have men often stay not warily to examine the agreement or disagreement of two ideas which they be desirous or concern to know but either incapable of such attention as be requisite in a long train of gradations or impatient of delay lightly cast their eye on or wholly pass by the proof and so without make out the demonstration determine of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas as it be by a view of them as they be at a distance and take it to be the one or the other as seem most likely to them upon such a loose survey this faculty of the mind when it be exercise immediately about things be call judgment when about truths deliver in word be most commonly call assent or dissent which be the most usual way wherein the mind have occasion to employ this faculty i shall under these term treat of it as least liable in our language to equivocation judgement be the presume things to be so without perceive it thus the mind have two faculties conversant about truth and falsehood first knowledge whereby it certainly perceive and be undoubtedly satisfy of the agreement or disagreement of any ideas secondly judgment which be the put ideas together or separate them from one another in the mind when their certain agreement or disagreement be not perceive but presume to be so which be as the word import take to be so before it certainly appear and if it so unite or separate them as in reality things be it be right judgment of probability probability be the appearance of agreement upon fallible proof as demonstration be the show the agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of one or more proof which have a constant immutable and visible connexion one with another so probability be nothing but the appearance of such an agreement or disagreement by the intervention of proof whose connexion be not constant and immutable or at least be not perceive to be so but be or appear for the most part to be so and be enough to induce the mind to judge the proposition to be true or false rather than the contrary for example in the demonstration of it a man perceive the certain immutable connexion there be of equality between the three angle of a triangle and those intermediate ones which be make use of to show their equality to two right ones and so by an intuitive knowledge of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step of the progress the whole series be continue with an evidence which clearly show the agreement or disagreement of those three angle in equality to two right ones and thus he have certain knowledge that it be so but another man who never take the pain to observe the demonstration hear a mathematician a man of credit affirm the three angle of a triangle to be equal to two right ones assent to it ie receive it for true in which case the foundation of his assent be the probability of the thing the proof be such as for the most part carry truth with it the man on whose testimony he receive it not be wont to affirm anything contrary to or besides his knowledge especially in matter of this kind so that that which cause his assent to this proposition that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones that which make him take these ideas to agree without know them to do so be the wonted veracity of the speaker in other case or his suppose veracity in this it be to supply our want of knowledge our knowledge as have be show be very narrow and we not happy enough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to consider most of the proposition we think reason discoursenay act upon be such as we can not have undoubted knowledge of their truth yet some of them border so near upon certainty that we make no doubt at all about them but assent to them as firmly and act accord to that assent as resolutely as if they be infallibly demonstrate and that our knowledge of them be perfect and certain but there be degrees herein from the very neighbourhood of certainty and demonstration quite down to improbability and unlikeness even to the confine of impossibility and also degrees of assent from full assurance and confidence quite down to conjecture doubt and distrust i shall come now have as i think find out the bound of human knowledge and certainty in the next place to consider the several degrees and ground of probability and assent or faith be that which make us presume things to be true before we know them to be so probability be likeliness to be true the very notation of the word signify such a proposition for which there be arguments or proof to make it pass or be receive for true the entertainment the mind give this sort of proposition be call belief assent or opinion which be the admit or receive any proposition for true upon arguments or proof that be find to persuade us to receive it as true without certain knowledge that it be so and herein lie the difference between probability and certainty faith and knowledge that in all the part of knowledge there be intuition each immediate idea each step have its visible and certain connexion in belief not so that which make me believe be something extraneous to the thing i believe something not evidently join on both side to and so not manifestly show the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that be under consideration the ground of probability be two conformity with our own experience or the testimony of others experience probability then be to supply the defect of our knowledge and to guide us where that fail be always conversant about proposition whereof we have no certainty but only some inducements to receive them for true the ground of it be in short these two follow first the conformity of anything with our own knowledge observation and experience secondly the testimony of others vouch their observation and experience in the testimony of others be to be consider the number the integrity the skill of the witness the design of the author where it be a testimony out of a book cite the consistency of the part and circumstances of the relation contrary testimonies in this all the arguments pro and con ought to be examine before we come to a judgment probability want that intuitive evidence which infallibly determine the understand and produce certain knowl edge the mind if it will proceed rationally ought to examine all the ground of probability and see how they make more or less for or against any proposition before it assent to or dissent from it and upon a due balance the whole reject or receive it with a more or less firm assent proportionably to the preponderancy of the greater ground of probability on one side or the other for example if i myself see a man walk on the ice it be past probability it be knowledge but if another tell me he saw a man in england in the midst of a sharp winter walk upon water harden with cold this have so great conformity with what be usually observe to happen that i be dispose by the nature of the thing itself to assent to it unless some manifest suspicion attend the relation of that matter of fact but if the same thing be tell to one bear between the tropics who never saw nor hear of any such thing before there the whole probability rely on testimony and as the relators be more in number and of more credit and have no interest to speak contrary to the truth so that matter of fact be like to find more or less belief though to a man whose experience have always be quite contrary and who have never hear of anything like it the most untainted credit of a witness will scarce be able to find belief the king of siam as it happen to a dutch ambassador who entertain the king of siam with the particularities of holland which he be inquisitive after amongst other things tell him that the water in his country would sometimes in cold weather be so hard that men walk upon it and that it would bear an elephant if he be there to which the king reply hitherto i have believe the strange things you have tell me because i look upon you as a sober fair man but now i be sure you lie probable arguments capable of great variety upon these ground depend the probability of any proposition and as the conformity of our knowledge as the certainty of observations as the frequency and constancy of experience and the number and credibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree with it so be any proposition in itself more or less probable there be another i confess which though by itself it be no true grind of probability yet be often make use of for one by which men most commonly regulate their assent and upon which they pin their faith more than anything else and that be the opinion of others though there can not be a more dangerous thing to rely on nor more likely to mislead one since there be much more falsehood and error among men than truth and knowledge and if the opinions and persuasions of others whom we know and think well of be a grind of assent men have reason to be heathens in japan mahometans in turkey papists in spain protestants in england and lutherans in sweden but of this wrong grind of assent i shall have occasion to speak more at large in another place of the degrees of assent our assent ought to be regulate by the ground of probability the ground of probability we have lay down in the forego chapter as they be the foundations on which our assent be build so be they also the measure whereby its several degrees be or ought to be regulate only we be to take notice that whatever ground of probability there may be they yet operate no further on the mind which search after truth and endeavour to judge right than they appear at least in the first judgment or search that the mind make i confess in the opinions men have and firmly stick to in the world their assent be not always from an actual view of the reason that at first prevail with them it be in many case almost impossible and in most very hard even for those who have very admirable memories to retain all the proof which upon a due examination make them embrace that side of the question it suffice that they have once with care and fairness sift the matter as far as they could and that they have search into all the particulars that they could imagine to give any light to the question and with the best of their skill cast up the account upon the whole evidence and thus have once find on which side the probability appear to them after as full and exact an inquiry as they can make they lay up the conclusion in their memories as a truth they have discover and for the future they remain satisfy with the testimony of their memories that this be the opinion that by the proof they have once see of it deserve such a degree of their assent as they afford it these can not always be actually in view and then we must content ourselves with the remembrance that we once saw grind for such a degree of assent this be all that the greatest part of men be capable of do in regulate their opinions and judgments unless a man will exact of them either to retain distinctly in their memories all the proof concern any probable truth and that too in the same order and regular deduction of consequences in which they have formerly place or see them which sometimes be enough to fill a large volume on one single question or else they must require a man for every opinion that he embrace every day to examine the proof both which be impossible it be unavoidable therefore that the memory be rely on in the case and that men be persuade of several opinions whereof the proof be not actually in their thoughts nay which perhaps they be not able actually to recall without this the greatest part of men must be either very sceptic or change every moment and yield themselves up to whoever have lately study the question offer them arguments which for want of memory they be not able presently to answer the ill consequence of this if our former judgments be not rightly make i can not but own that mens stick to their past judgment and adhere firmly to conclusions formerly make be often the cause of great obstinacy in error and mistake but the fault be not that they rely on their memories for what they have before well judge but because they judge before they have well examine may we not find a great number not to say the greatest part of men that think they have form right judgments of several matter and that for no other reason but because they never think otherwise that imagine themselves to have judge right only because they never question never examine their own opin ions which be indeed to think they judge right because they never judge at all and yet these of all men hold their opinions with the greatest stiffness those be generally the most fierce and firm in their tenets who have least examine them what we once know we be certain be so and we may be secure that there be no latent proof undiscovered which may overturn our knowledge or bring it in doubt but in matter of probability it be not in every case we can be sure that we have all the particulars before us that any way concern the question and that there be no evidence behind and yet unseen which may cast the probability on the other side and outweigh all that at present seem to preponderate with us who almost be there that hath the leisure patience and mean to collect together all the proof concern most of the opinions he have so as safely to conclude that he hath a clear and full view and that there be no more to be allege for his better information and yet we be force to determine ourselves on the one side or other the conduct of our live and the management of our great concern will not bear delay for those depend for the most part on the determination of our judgment in point wherein we be not capable of certain and demonstrative knowledge and wherein it be necessary for us to embrace the one side or the other the right use of it mutual charity and forbearance in a necessary diversity of opinions since therefore it be unavoidable to the greatest part of men if not all to have several opinions without certain and indubitable proof of their truth and it carry too great an imputation of ignorance lightness or folly for men to quit and renounce their former tenets presently upon the offer of an argument which they can not immediately answer and show the insufficiency of it would methinks become all men to maintain peace and the common offices of humanity and friendship in the diversity of opinions since we can not reasonably expect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit his own opinion and embrace ours with a blind resignation to an authority which the understand of man acknowledge not for however it may often mistake it can own no other guide but reason nor blindly submit to the will and dictate of another if he you would bring over to your sentiments be one that examine before he assent you must give him leave at his leisure to go over the account again and recall what be out of his mind examine all the particulars to see on which side the advantage lie and if he will not think our arguments of weight enough to engage him anew in so much pain it be but what we often do ourselves in the like case and we should take it amiss if others should prescribe to us what point we should study and if he be one who take his opinions upon trust how can we imagine that he should renounce those tenets which time and custom have so settle in his mind that he think them selfevident and of an unquestionable certainty or which he take to be impressions he have receive from god himself or from men send by him how can we expect i say that opinions thus settle should be give up to the arguments or authority of a stranger or adversary especially if there be any suspicion of interest or design as there never fail to be where men find themselves ill treat we should do well to commiserate our mutual ignorance and endeavour to remove it in all the gentle and fair ways of information and not instantly treat others ill as obstinate and perverse because they will not renounce their own and receive our opinions or at least those we would force upon them when it be more than probable that we be no less obstinate in not embrace some of theirs for where be the man that have incontestable evidence of the truth of all that he hold or of the falsehood of all he condemn or can say that he have examine to the bottom all his own or other mens opinions the necessity of believe without knowledge nay often upon very slight ground in this fleet state of action and blindness we be in should make us more busy and careful to inform ourselves than constrain others at least those who have not thoroughly examine to the bottom all their own tenets must confess they be unfit to prescribe to others and be unreasonable in impose that as truth on other mens belief which they themselves have not search into nor weigh the arguments of probabil ity on which they should receive or reject it those who have fairly and truly examine and be thereby get past doubt in all the doctrines they profess and govern themselves by would have a juster pretence to require others to follow them but these be so few in number and find so little reason to be magisterial in their opinions that nothing insolent and imperious be to be expect from them and there be reason to think that if men be better instruct themselves they would be less impose on others probability be either of sensible matter of fact capable of human testimony or of what be beyond the evidence of our sense but to return to the ground of assent and the several degrees of it we be to take notice that the proposition we receive upon inducements of probability be of two sort either concern some particular existence or as it be usually term matter of fact which fall under observation be capable of human testimony or else concern things which be beyond the discovery of our sense be not capable of any such testimony the concurrent experience of all other men with ours produce assurance approach to knowledge concern the first of these viz particular matter of fact i where any particular thing consonant to the constant observation of ourselves and others in the like case come attest by the concurrent report of all that mention it we receive it as easily and build as firmly upon it as if it be certain knowledge and we reason and act thereupon with as little doubt as if it be perfect demonstration thus if all englishmen who have occasion to mention it should affirm that it freeze in england the last winter or that there be swallow see there in the summer i think a man could almost as little doubt of it as that seven and four be eleven the first therefore and highest degree of probability be when the general consent of all men in all age as far as it can be know concur with a man constant and neverfailing experience in like case to confirm the truth of any particular matter of fact attest by fair witness such be all the state constitutions and prop erties of body and the regular proceed of cause and effect in the ordinary course of nature this we call an argument from the nature of things themselves for what our own and other mens constant observation have find always to be after the same manner that we with reason conclude to be the effect of steady and regular cause though they come not within the reach of our knowledge thus that fire warm a man make lead fluid and change the colour or consistency in wood or charcoal that iron sink in water and swim in quicksilver these and the like proposition about particular facts be agreeable to our constant experience as often as we have to do with these matter and be generally speak of when mention by others as things find constantly to be so and therefore not so much as controvert by anybodywe be put past doubt that a relation affirm any such thing to have be or any prediction that it will happen again in the same manner be very true these probabilities rise so near to certainty that they govern our thoughts as absolutely and influence all our action as fully as the most evident demonstration and in what concern us we make little or no difference between them and certain knowledge our belief thus ground rise to assurance ii unquestionable testimony and our own experience that a thing be for the most part so produce confidence the next degree of probability be when i find by my own experience and the agreement of all others that mention it a thing to be for the most part so and that the particular instance of it be attest by many and undoubted witness vg history give us such an account of men in all age and my own experience as far as i have an opportunity to observe confirm it that most men prefer their private advantage to the public if all historians that write of tiberius say that tiberius do so it be extremely probable and in this case our assent have a sufficient foundation to raise itself to a degree which we may call confidence iii fair testimony and the nature of the thing indifferent produce unavoidable assent in things that happen indifferently as that a bird should fly this or that way that it should thunder on a man right or leave hand c when any particular matter of fact be vouch by the concurrent testimony of unsuspected witness there our assent be also unavoidable thus that there be such a city in italy as rome that about one thousand seven hundred years ago there live in it a man call julius caesar that he be a general and that he win a battle against another call pompey this though in the nature of the thing there be nothing for nor against it yet be relate by historians of credit and contradict by no one writer a man can not avoid believe it and can as little doubt of it as he do of the be and action of his own acquaintance whereof he himself be a witness experience and testimonies clash infinitely vary the degrees of probability thus far the matter go easy enough probability upon such ground carry so much evidence with it that it naturally determine the judgment and leave us as little liberty to believe or disbelieve as a demonstration do whether we will know or be ignorant the difficulty be when testimonies contradict common experience and the report of history and witness clash with the ordinary course of nature or with one another there it be where diligence attention and exactness be require to form a right judgment and to proportion the assent to the different evidence and probability of the thing which rise and fall accord as those two foundations of credibility viz common observation in like case and particular testimonies in that particular instance favour or contradict it these be liable to so great variety of contrary observations circumstances report different qualifications temper design oversights c of the reporters that it be impossible to reduce to precise rule the various degrees wherein men give their assent this only may be say in general that as the arguments and proof pro and con upon due examination nicely weigh every particular circumstance shall to any one appear upon the whole matter in a greater or less degree to preponderate on either side so they be fit to produce in the mind such different entertainments as we call belief conjecture guess doubt waver distrust disbelief c traditional testimonies the further remove the less their proof become this be what concern assent in matter wherein testimony be make use of concern which i think it may not be amiss to take notice of a rule observe in the law of england which be that though the attest copy of a record be good proof yet the copy of a copy ever so well attest and by ever so credible witness will not be admit as a proof in judicature this be so generally approve as reasonable and suit to the wisdom and caution to be use in our inquiry after material truths that i never yet hear of any one that blame it this practice if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong carry this observation along with it viz that any testimony the further off it be from the original truth the less force and proof it have the be and existence of the thing itself be what i call the original truth a credible man vouch his knowledge of it be a good proof but if another equally credible do witness it from his report the testimony be weaker and a third that attest the hearsay of an hearsay be yet less considerable so that in traditional truths each remove weaken the force of the proof and the more hand the tradition have successively pass through the less strength and evidence do it receive from them this i think necessary to be take notice of because i find amongst some men the quite contrary commonly practise who look on opinions to gain force by grow older and what a thousand years since would not to a rational man contemporary with the first voucher have appear at all probable be now urge as certain beyond all question only because several have since from him say it one after another upon this grind proposition evidently false or doubtful enough in their first begin come by an invert rule of probability to pass for authentic truths and those which find or deserve little credit from the mouth of their first author be think to grow venerable by age be urge as undeniable yet history be of great use i would not be think here to lessen the credit and use of history it be all the light we have in many case and we have in many case and we receive from it a great part of the useful truths we have with a convince evidence i think nothing more valuable than the record of antiquity i wish we have more of them and more uncorrupted but this truth itself force me to say that no probability can rise higher than its first original what have no other evidence than the single testimony of one only witness must stand or fall by his only testimony whether good bad or indifferent and though cite afterwards by hundreds of others one after another be so far from receive any strength thereby that it be only the weaker passion interest inadvertency mistake of his mean and a thousand odd reason or capricios mens mind be act by impossible to be discover may make one man quote another man word or mean wrong he that have but ever so little examine the citations of writers can not doubt how little credit the quotations deserve where the originals be want and consequently how much less quotations of quotations can be rely on this be certain that what in one age be affirm upon slight ground can never after come to be more valid in future age by be often repeat but the further still it be from the original the less valid it be and have always less force in the mouth or write of him that last make use of it than in his from whom he receive it in things which sense can not discover analogy be the great rule of probability secondly the probabilities we have hitherto mention be only such as concern matter of fact and such things as be capable of observation and testimony there remain that other sort concern which men entertain opinions with variety of assent though the things be such that fall not under the reach of our sense they be not capable of testimony such be the existence nature and operations of finite immaterial be without us as spirit angels devil c or the existence of material be which either for their smallness in themselves or remoteness from us our sense can not take notice ofas whether there be any plant animals and intelligent inhabitants in the planets and other mansions of the vast universe concern the manner of operation in most part of the work of nature wherein though we see the sensible effect yet their cause be unknown and we perceive not the ways and manner how they be produce we see animals be generate nourish and move the loadstone draw iron and the part of a candle successively melt turn into flame and give us both light and heat these and the like effect we see and know but the cause that operate and the manner they be produce in we can only guess and probably conjecture for these and the like come not within the scrutiny of human sense can not be examine by them or be attest by anybody and therefore can appear more or less probable only as they more or less agree to truths that be establish in our mind and as they hold proportion to other part of our knowledge and observation analogy in these matter be the only help we have and it be from that alone we draw all our ground of probability thus observe that the bare rub of two body violently one upon another produce heat and very often fire itself we have reason to think that what we call heat and fire consist in a violent agitation of the imperceptible minute part of the burn matter observe likewise that the different refractions of pellucid body produce in our eye the different appearances of several colour and also that the different range and lay the superficial part of several body as of velvet water silk c do the like we think it probable that the colour and shin of body be in them nothing but the different arrangement and refraction of their minute and insensible part thus find in all part of the creation that fall under human observation that there be a gradual connexion of one with another without any great or discernible gap between in all that great variety of things we see in the world which be so closely link together that in the several rank of be it be not easy to discover the bound betwixt them we have reason to be persuade that by such gentle step things ascend upwards in degrees of perfection it be a hard matter to say where sensible and rational begin and where insensible and irrational end and who be there quicksighted enough to determine precisely which be the lowest species of live things and which the first of those which have no life things as far as we can observe lessen and augment as the quantity do in a regular cone where though there be a manifest odds betwixt the bigness of the diameter at a remote distance yet the difference between the upper and under where they touch one another be hardly discernible the difference be exceed great between some men and some animals but if we will compare the understand and abilities of some men and some brutes we shall find so little difference that it will be hard to say that that of the man be either clearer or larger observe i say such gradual and gentle descents downwards in those part of the creation that be beneath man the rule of analogy may make it probable that it be so also in things above us and our observation and that there be several rank of intelligent be excel us in several degrees of perfection ascend upwards towards the infinite perfection of the creator by gentle step and differences that be every one at no great distance from the next to it this sort of probability which be the best conduct of rational experiment and the rise of hypothesis have also its use and influence and a wary reason from analogy lead us often into the discovery of truths and useful productions which would otherwise lie conceal one case where contrary experience lessen not the testimony though the common experience and the ordinary course of things have justly a mighty influence on the mind of men to make them give or refuse credit to anything propose to their belief yet there be one case wherein the strangeness of the fact lessen not the assent to a fair testimony give of it for where such supernatural events be suitable to end aim at by him who have the power to change the course of nature there under such circumstances that may be the fitter to procure belief by how much the more they be beyond or contrary to ordinary observation this be the proper case of miracles which well attest do not only find credit themselves but give it also to other truths which need such confirmation the bare testimony of divine revelation be the highest certainty besides those we have hitherto mention there be one sort of proposition that challenge the highest degree of our assent upon bare testimony whether the thing propose agree or disagree with common experience and the ordinary course of things or no the reason whereof be because the testimony be of such an one as can not deceive nor be deceive and that be of god himself this carry with it an assurance beyond doubt evidence beyond exception this be call by a peculiar name revelation and our assent to it faith which as absolutely determine our mind and as perfectly exclude all waver as our knowledge itself and we may as well doubt of our own be as we can whether any revelation from god be true so that faith be a settle and sure principle of assent and assurance and leave no manner of room for doubt or hesitation only we must be sure that it be a divine revelation and that we understand it right else we shall expose ourselves to all the extravagancy of enthusiasm and all the error of wrong principles if we have faith and assurance in what be not divine revelation and therefore in those case our assent can be rationally no higher than the evidence of its be a revelation and that this be the mean of the expressions it be deliver in if the evidence of its be a revelation or that this be its true sense be only on probable proof our assent can reach no higher than an assurance or diffidence arise from the more or less apparent probability of the proof but of faith and the precedency it ought to have before other arguments of persuasion i shall speak more hereafter where i treat of it as it be ordinarily place in contradistinction to reason though in truth it be nothing else but an assent found on the highest reason of reason various significations of the word reason the word reason in the english language have different significations sometimes it be take for true and clear principles sometimes for clear and fair deductions from those principles and sometimes for the cause and particularly the final cause but the consideration i shall have of it here be in a signification different from all these and that be as it stand for a faculty in man that faculty whereby man be suppose to be distinguish from beasts and wherein it be evident he much surpass them wherein reason consist if general knowledge as have be show consist in a perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas and the knowledge of the existence of all things without us except only of a god whose existence every man may certainly know and demonstrate to himself from his own existence be have only by our sense what room be there for the exercise of any other faculty but outward sense and inward perception what need it there of reason very much both for the enlargement of our knowledge and regulate our assent for it hath to do both in knowledge and opinion and be necessary and assist to all our other intellectual faculties and indeed contain two of them viz sagacity and illation by the one it find out and by the other it so order the intermediate ideas as to discover what connexion there be in each link of the chain whereby the extremes be hold together and thereby as it be to draw into view the truth seek for which be that which we call illation or inference and consist in nothing but the perception of the connexion there be between the ideas in each step of the deduction whereby the mind come to see either the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas as in demonstration in which it arrive at knowledge or their probable connexion on which it give or withhold its assent as in opinion sense and intuition reach but a very little way the greatest part of our knowledge depend upon deductions and intermediate ideas and in those case where we be fain to substitute assent instead of knowledge and take proposition for true without be certain they be so we have need to find out examine and compare the ground of their probability in both these case the faculty which find out the mean and rightly apply them to discover certainty in the one and probability in the other be that which we call reason for as reason perceive the necessary and indubitable connexion of all the ideas or proof one to another in each step of any demonstration that produce knowledge so it likewise perceive the probable connexion of all the ideas or proof one to another in every step of a discourse to which it will think assent due this be the lowest degree of that which can be truly call reason for where the mind do not perceive this probable connexion where it do not discern whether there be any such connexion or no there mens opinions be not the product of judgment or the consequence of reason but the effect of chance and hazard of a mind float at all adventure without choice and without direction reason in its four degrees so that we may in reason consider these degrees four the first and highest be the discover and find out of truths the second the regular and methodical disposition of them and lay them in a clear and fit order to make their connexion and force be plainly and easily perceive the third be the perceive their connexion and the fourth a make a right conclusion these several degrees may be observe in any mathematical demonstration it be one thing to perceive the connexion of each part as the demonstration be make by another another to perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the part a third to make out a demonstration clearly and neatly ones self and something different from all these to have first find out these intermediate ideas or proof by which it be make whether syllogism be the great instrument of reason first cause to doubt this there be one thing more which i shall desire to be consider concern reason and that be whether syllogism as be generally think be the proper instrument of it and the usefullest way of exercise this faculty the cause i have to doubt be these first because syllogism serve our reason but in one only of the forementioned part of it and that be to show the connexion of the proof in any one instance and no more but in this it be of no great use since the mind can perceive such connexion where it really be as easily nay perhaps better without it men can reason well who can not make a syllogism if we will observe the act of our own mind we shall find that we reason best and clearest when we only observe the connexion of the proof without reduce our thoughts to any rule of syllogism and therefore we may take notice that there be many men that reason exceed clear and rightly who know not how to make a syllogism he that will look into many part of asia and america will find men reason there perhaps as acutely as himself who yet never hear of a syllogism nor can reduce any one argument to those form and i believe scarce any one make syllogisms in reason within himself indeed syllogism be make use of on occasion to discover a fallacy hide in a rhetorical flourish or cunningly wrapt up in a smooth period and strip an absurdity of the cover of wit and good language show it in its naked deformity but the weakness or fallacy of such a loose discourse it show by the artificial form it be put into only to those who have thoroughly study mode and figure and have so examine the many ways that three proposition may be put together as to know which of them do certainly conclude right and which not and upon what ground it be that they do so all who have so far consider syllogism as to see the reason why in three proposition lay together in one form the conclusion will be certainly right but in another not certainly so i grant be certain of the conclusion they draw from the premise in the allow modes and figure but they who have not so far look into those form be not sure by virtue of syllogism that the conclusion certainly follow from the premise they only take it to be so by an implicit faith in their teachers and a confidence in those form of argumentation but this be still but believe not be certain now if of all mankind those who can make syllogisms be extremely few in comparison of those who can not and if of those few who have be teach logic there be but a very small number who do any more than believe that syllogisms in the allow modes and figure do conclude right without know certainly that they do so if syllogisms must be take for the only proper instrument of reason and mean of knowledge it will follow that before aristotle there be not one man that do or could know anything by reason and that since the invention of syllogisms there be not one of ten thousand that doth aristotle but god have not be so spar to men to make them barely twolegged creatures and leave it to aristotle to make them rational ie those few of them that he could get so to examine the ground of syllogisms as to see that in above three score ways that three proposition may be lay together there be but about fourteen wherein one may be sure that the conclusion be right and upon what ground it be that in these few the conclusion be certain and in the other not god have be more bountiful to mankind than so he have give them a mind that can reason without be instruct in methods of syllogize the understand be not teach to reason by these rule it have a native faculty to perceive the coherence or incoherence of its ideas and can range them right without any such perplex repetitions i say not this any way to lessen aristotle whom i look on as one of the greatest men amongst the ancients whose large view acuteness and penetration of think and strength of judgment few have equal and who in this very invention of form of argumentation wherein the conclusion may be show to be rightly infer do great service against those who be not ashamed to deny anything and i readily own that all right reason may be reduce to his form of syllogism but yet i think without any diminution to him i may truly say that they be not the only nor the best way of reason for the lead of those into truth who be will to find it and desire to make the best use they may of their reason for the attainment of knowledge and he himself it be plain find out some form to be conclusive and others not not by the form themselves but by the original way of knowledge ie by the visible agreement of ideas tell a country gentlewoman that the wind be southwest and the weather lower and like to rain and she will easily understand it be not safe for her to go abroad thin clothe in such a day after a fever she clearly see the probable connexion of all these viz southwest wind and cloud rain wet take cold relapse and danger of death without tie them together in those artificial and cumbersome fetter of several syllogisms that clog and hinder the mind which proceed from one part to another quicker and clearer without them and the probability which she easily perceive in things thus in their native state would be quite lose if this argument be manage learnedly and propose in mode and figure for it very often confound the connexion and i think every one will perceive in mathematical demonstrations that the knowledge gain thereby come shortest and clearest without syllogism inference be look on as the great act of the rational faculty and so it be when it be rightly make but the mind either very desirous to enlarge its knowledge or very apt to favour the sentiments it have once imbibe be very forward to make inferences and therefore often make too much haste before it perceive the connexion of the ideas that must hold the extremes together syllogism do not discover ideas or their connexions to infer be nothing but by virtue of one proposition lay down as true to draw in another as true ie to see or suppose such a connexion of the two ideas of the infer proposition vg let this be the proposition lay down men shall be punish in another world and from thence be infer this other then men can determine themselves the question now be to know whether the mind have make this inference right or no if it have make it by find out the intermediate ideas and take a view of the connexion of them place in a due order it have proceed rationally and make a right inference if it have do it without such a view it have not so much make an inference that will hold or an inference of right reason as show a willingness to have it be or be take for such but in neither case be it syllogism that discover those ideas or show the connexion of them for they must be both find out and the connexion everywhere perceive before they can rationally be make use of in syllogism unless it can be say that any idea without consider what connexion it hath with the two other whose agreement should be show by it will do well enough in a syllogism and may be take at a venture for the medius terminus to prove any conclusion but this nobody will say because it be by virtue of the perceive agreement of the intermediate idea with the extremes that the extremes be conclude to agree and therefore each intermediate idea must be such as in the whole chain hath a visible connexion with those two it have be place between or else thereby the conclusion can not be infer or draw in for wherever any link of the chain be loose and without connexion there the whole strength of it be lose and it hath no force to infer or draw in anything in the instance above mention what be it show the force of the inference and consequently the reasonableness of it but a view of the connexion of all the intermediate ideas that draw in the conclusion or proposition infer vg men shall be punish god the punisher just punishment the punish guilty could have do otherwise freedom selfdetermination by which chain of ideas thus visibly link together in train ie each intermediate idea agree on each side with those two it be immediately place between the ideas of men and selfdetermination appear to be connect ie this proposition men can determine themselves be draw in or infer from this that they shall be punish in the other world for here the mind see the connexion there be between the idea of mens punishment in the other world and the idea of god punish between god punish and the justice of the punishment between justice of punishment and guilt between guilt and a power to do otherwise between a power to do otherwise and freedom and between freedom and selfdetermination see the connexion between men and selfdetermination the connexion must be discover before it can be put into syllogisms now i ask whether the connexion of the extremes be not more clearly see in this simple and natural disposition than in the perplex repetitions and jumble of five or six syllogisms i must beg pardon for call it jumble till somebody shall put these ideas into so many syllogisms and then say that they be less jumble and their connexion more visible when they be transpose and repeat and spin out to a greater length in artificial form than in that short and natural plain order they be lay down in here wherein everyone may see it and wherein they must be see before they can be put into a train of syllogisms for the natural order of the connect ideas must direct the order of the syllogisms and a man must see the connexion of each intermediate idea with those that it connect before he can with reason make use of it in a syllogism and when all those syllogisms be make neither those that be nor those that be not logicians will see the force of the argumentation ie the connexion of the extremes one jot the better for those that be not men of art not know the true form of syllogism nor the reason of them can not know whether they be make in right and conclusive modes and figure or no and so be not at all help by the form they be put into though by them the natural order wherein the mind could judge of their respective connexion be disturb render the illation much more uncertain than without them and as for the logicians themselves they see the connexion of each intermediate idea with those it stand between on which the force of the inference depend as well before as after the syllogism be make or else they do not see it at all for a syllogism neither show nor strengthen the connexion of any two ideas immediately put together but only by the connexion see in them show what connexion the extremes have one with another but what connexion the intermediate have with either of the extremes in the syllogism that no syllogism do or can show that the mind only doth or can perceive as they stand there in that juxtaposition by its own view to which the syllogistical form it happen to be in give no help or light at all it only show that if the intermediate idea agree with those it be on both side immediately apply to then those two remote ones or as they be call extremes do certainly agree and therefore the immediate connexion of each idea to that which it be apply to on each side on which the force of the reason depend be as well see before as after the syllogism be make or else he that make the syllogism could never see it at all this as have be already observe be see only by the eye or the perceptive faculty of the mind take a view of them lay together in a juxtaposition which view of any two it have equally whenever they be lay together in any proposition whether that proposition be place as a major or a minor in a syllogism or no use of syllogism of what use then be syllogisms i answer their chief and main use be in the school where men be allow without shame to deny the agreement of ideas that do manifestly agree or out of the school to those who from thence have learn without shame to deny the connexion of ideas which even to themselves be visible but to an ingenuous searcher after truth who have no other aim but to find it there be no need of any such form to force the allow of the inference the truth and reasonableness of it be better see in range of the ideas in a simple and plain order and hence it be that men in their own inquiries after truth never use syllogisms to convince themselves or in teach others to instruct will learners because before they can put them into a syllogism they must see the connexion that be between the intermediate idea and the two other ideas it be set between and apply to to show their agreement and when they see that they see whether the inference be good or no and so syllogism come too late to settle it for to make use again of the former instance i ask whether the mind consider the idea of justice place as an intermediate idea between the punishment of men and the guilt of the punish and till it do so consider it the mind can not make use of it as a medius terminus do not as plainly see the force and strength of the inference as when it be form into a syllogism to show it in a very plain and easy example let animal be the intermediate idea or medius terminus that the mind make use of to show the connexion of homo and vivens i ask whether the mind do not more readily and plainly see that connexion in the simple and proper position of the connect idea in the middle thus homoanimalvivens than in this perplex one animalvivenshomoanimal which be the position these ideas have in a syllogism to show the connexion between homo and vivens by the intervention of animal not the only way to detect fallacies indeed syllogism be think to be of necessary use even to the lovers of truth to show them the fallacies that be often conceal in florid witty or involve discourse but that this be a mistake will appear if we consider that the reason why sometimes men who sincerely aim at truth be impose upon by such loose and as they be call rhetorical discourse be that their fancy be strike with some lively metaphorical representations they neglect to observe or do not easily perceive what be the true ideas upon which the inference depend now to show such men the weakness of such an argumentation there need no more but to strip if of the superfluous ideas which blend and confound with those on which the inference depend seem to show a connexion where there be none or at least to hinder the discovery of the want of it and then to lay the naked ideas on which the force of the argumentation depend in their due order in which position the mind take a view of them see what connexion they have and so be able to judge of the inference without any need of a syllogism at all i grant that mode and figure be commonly make use of in such case as if the detection of the incoherence of such loose discourse be wholly owe to the syllogistical form and so i myself formerly think till upon a stricter examination i now find that lay the intermediate ideas naked in their due order show the incoherence of the argumentation better than syllogism not only as subject each link of the chain to the immediate view of the mind in its proper place whereby its connexion be best observe but also because syllogism show the incoherence only to those who be not one of ten thousand who perfectly understand mode and figure and the reason upon which those form be establish whereas a due and orderly place of the ideas upon which the inference be make make every one whether logician or not logician who understand the term and hath the faculty to perceive the agreement or disagreement of such ideas without which in or out of syllogism he can not perceive the strength or weakness coherence or incoherence of the discourse see the want of connexion in the argumentation and the absurdity of the inference and thus i have know a man unskilful in syllogism who at first hear could perceive the weakness and inconclusiveness of a long artificial and plausible discourse wherewith others better skilled in syllogism have be mislead and i believe there be few of my readers who do not know such and indeed if it be not so the debate of most princes councils and the business of assemblies would be in danger to be mismanage since those who be rely upon and have usually a great stroke in them be not always such who have the good luck to be perfectly know in the form of syllogism or expert in mode and figure and if syllogism be the only or so much as the surest way to detect the fallacies of artificial discourse i do not think that all mankind even princes in matter that concern their crown and dignities be so much in love with falsehood and mistake that they would everywhere have neglect to bring syllogism into the debate of moment or think it ridiculous so much as to offer them in affairs of consequence a plain evidence to me that men of part and penetration who be not idly to dispute at their ease but be to act accord to the result of their debate and often pay for their mistake with their head or fortunes find those scholastic form be of little use to discover truth or fallacy whilst both the one and the other might be show and better show without them to those who would not refuse to see what be visibly show them another cause to doubt whether syllogism be the only proper instrument of reason in the discovery of truth secondly another reason that make me doubt whether syllogism be the only proper instrument of reason in the discovery of truth be that of whatever use mode and figure be pretend to be in the lay open of fallacy which have be above consider those scholastic form of discourse be not less liable to fallacies than the plainer ways of argumentation and for this i appeal to common observation which have always find these artificial methods of reason more adapt to catch and entangle the mind than to instruct and inform the understand and hence it be that men even when they be baffle and silence in this scholastic way be seldom or never convince and so bring over to the conquer side they perhaps acknowledge their adversary to be the more skilful disputant but rest nevertheless persuade of the truth on their side and go away worst as they be with the same opinion they bring with them which they could not do if this way of argumentation carry light and conviction with it and make men see where the truth lay and therefore syllogism have be think more proper for the attain victory in dispute than for the discovery or confirmation of truth in fair inquiries and if it be certain that fallacies can be couch in syllogism as it can not be deny it must be something else and not syllogism that must discover them i have have experience how ready some men be when all the use which they have be wont to ascribe to anything be not allow to cry out that i be for lay it wholly aside but to prevent such unjust and groundless imputations i tell them that i be not for take away any help to the understand in the attainment of knowledge and if men skilled in and use to syllogisms find them assist to their reason in the discovery of truth i think they ought to make use of them all that i aim at be that they should not ascribe more to these form than belong to them and think that men have no use or not so full an use of their reason faculties without them some eye want spectacles to see things clearly and distinctly but let not those that use them therefore say nobody can see clearly without them those who do so will be think in favour of art which perhaps they be behold to a little too much to depress and discredit nature reason by its own penetration where it be strong and exercise usually see quicker and clearer without syllogism if use of those spectacles have so dim its sight that it can not without them see consequences or inconsequences in argumentation i be not so unreasonable as to be against the use them every one know what best fit his own sight but let him not thence conclude all in the dark who use not just the same help that he find a need of syllogism help little in demonstration less in probability but however it be in knowledge i think i may truly say it be of far less or no use at all in probabilities for the assent there be to be determine by the preponderancy after due weigh of all the proof with all circumstances on both side nothing be so unfit to assist the mind in that as syllogism which run away with one assume probability or one topical argument pursue that till it have lead the mind quite out of sight of the thing under consideration and force it upon some remote difficulty hold it fast there entangle perhaps and as it be manacle in the chain of syllogisms without allow it the liberty much less afford it the help requisite to show on which side all things consider be the greater probability serve not to increase our knowledge but to fence with the knowledge we suppose we have but let it help us as perhaps may be say in convince men of their errors and mistake and yet i would fain see the man that be force out of his opinion by dint of syllogism yet still it fail our reason in that part which if not its highest perfection be yet certainly its hardest task and that which we most need its help in and that be the find out of proof and make new discoveries the rule of syllogism serve not to furnish the mind with those intermediate ideas that may show the connexion of remote ones this way of reason discover no new proof but be the art of marshal and range the old ones we have already the fortyseventh proposition of the first book of euclid be very true but the discovery of it i think not owe to any rule of common logic a man know first and then he be able to prove syllogistically so that syllogism come after knowledge and then a man have little or no need of it but it be chiefly by the find out those ideas that show the connexion of distant ones that our stock of knowledge be increase and that useful arts and sciences be advance syllogism at best be but the art of fence with the little knowledge we have without make any addition to it and if a man should employ his reason all this way he will not do much otherwise than he who have get some iron out of the bowels of the earth should have it beat up all into swords and put it into his servants hand to fence with and bang one another have the king of spain employ the hand of his people and his spanish iron so he have bring to light but little of that treasure that lay so long hide in the dark entrails of america and i be apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of his reason only in brandish of syllogisms will discover very little of that mass of knowledge which lie yet conceal in the secret recess of nature and which i be apt to think native rustic reason as it formerly have do be likelier to open a way to and add to the common stock of mankind rather than any scholastic proceed by the strict rule of mod and figure other help to reason than syllogism should be seek i doubt not nevertheless but there be ways to be find to assist our reason in this most useful part and this the judicious hooker encourage me to say who in his eccl pol i ss speak thus if there might be add the right help of true art and learn which help i must plainly confess this age of the world carry the name of a learn age doth neither much know nor generally regard there would undoubtedly be almost as much difference in maturity of judgment between men therewith inure and that which men now be as between men that be now and innocents i do not pretend to have find or discover here any of those right help of art this great man of deep think mention but that be plain that syllogism and the logic now in use which be as well know in his days can be none of those he mean it be sufficient for me if by a discourse perhaps something out of the way i be sure as to me wholly new and unborrowed i shall have give occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries and to seek in their own thoughts for those right help of art which will scarce be find i fear by those who servilely confine themselves to the rule and dictate of others for beat track lead this sort of cattle as an observe roman call them whose thoughts reach only to imitation non quo eundum est sed quo itur but i can be bold to say that this age be adorn with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension that if they would employ their thoughts on this subject could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge we can reason about particulars and the immediate object of all our reason be nothing but particular ideas have here have occasion to speak of syllogism in general and the use of it in reason and the improvement of our knowledge it be fit before i leave this subject to take notice of one manifest mistake in the rule of syllogism viz that no syllogistical reason can be right and conclusive but what have at least one general proposition in it as if we could not reason and have knowledge about particulars whereas in truth the matter rightly consider the immediate object of all our reason and knowledge be nothing but particulars every man reason and knowledge be only about the ideas exist in his own mind which be truly every one of them particular existences and our knowledge and reason about other things be only as they correspond with those particular ideas so that the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our particular ideas be the whole and utmost of all our knowledge universality be but accidental to it and consist only in this that the particular ideas about which it be be such as more than one particular thing can correspond with and be represent by but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas and consequently our knowledge be equally clear and certain whether either or both or neither of those ideas be capable of represent more real be than one or no one thing more i crave leave to offer about syllogism before i leave it viz may one not upon just grind inquire whether the form syllogism now have be that which in reason it ought to have for the medius terminus be to join the extremes ie the intermediate ideas by its intervention to show the agreement or disagreement of the two in question would not the position of the medius terminus be more natural and show the agreement or disagreement of the extremes clearer and better if it be place in the middle between them which might be easily do by transpose the proposition and make the medius terminus the predicate of the first and the subject of the second as thus omnis homo est animal omne animal est vivens ergo omnis homo est vivens omne corpus est extensum et solidum nullum extensum et solidum est pura extensio ergo corpus non est pura extensio i need not trouble my reader with instance in syllogisms whose conclusions be particular the same reason hold for the same form in them as well as in the general our reason often fail us reason though it penetrate into the depths of the sea and earth elevate our thoughts as high as the star and lead us through the vast space and large room of this mighty fabric yet it come far short of the real extent of even corporeal be and there be many instance wherein it fail us as i in case when we have no ideas it perfectly fail us where our ideas fail it neither do nor can extend itself further than they do and therefore wherever we have no ideas our reason stop and we be at an end of our reckon and if at any time we reason about word which do not stand for any ideas it be only about those sound and nothing else ii because our ideas be often obscure or imperfect our reason be often puzzle and at a loss because of the obscurity confusion or imperfection of the ideas it be employ about and there we be involve in difficulties and contradictions thus not have any perfect idea of the least extension of matter nor of infinity we be at a loss about the divisibility of matter but have perfect clear and distinct ideas of number our reason meet with none of those inextricable difficulties in number nor find itself involve in any contradictions about them thus we have but imperfect ideas of the operations of out mind and of the begin of motion or think how the mind produce either of them in us and much imperfecter yet of the operation of god run into great difficulties about free create agents which reason can not well extricate itself out of iii because we perceive not intermediate ideas to show conclusions our reason be often at a stand because it perceive not those ideas which could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or disagreement of any other two ideas and in this some mens faculties far outgo others till algebra that great instrument and instance of human sagacity be discover men with amazement look on several of the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians and could scarce forbear to think the find several of those proof to be something more than human iv because we often proceed upon wrong principles the mind by proceed upon false principles be often engage in absurdities and difficulties bring into straits and contradictions without know how to free itself and in that case it be in vain to implore the help of reason unless it be to discover the falsehood and reject the influence of those wrong principles reason be so far from clear the difficulties which the build upon false foundations bring a man into that if he will pursue it it entangle him the more and engage him deeper in perplexities v because we often employ doubtful term as obscure and imperfect ideas often involve our reason so upon the same grind do dubious word and uncertain sign often in discourse and argue when not warily attend to puzzle mens reason and bring them to a nonplus but these two latter be our fault and not the fault of reason but yet the consequences of them be nevertheless obvious and the perplexities or errors they fill mens mind with be everywhere observable our highest degree of knowledge be intuitive without reason some of the ideas that be in the mind be so there that they can be by themselves immediately compare one with another and in these the mind be able to perceive that they agree or disagree as clearly as that it have them thus the mind perceive that an arch of a circle be less than the whole circle as clearly as it do the idea of a circle and this therefore as have be say i call intuitive knowledge which be certain beyond all doubt and need no probation nor can have any this be the highest of all human certainty in this consist the evidence of all those maxims which nobody have any doubt about but every man do not as be say only assent to but know to be true as soon as ever they be propose to his understand in the discovery of and assent to these truths there be no use of the discursive faculty no need of reason but they be know by a superior and higher degree of evidence and such if i may guess at things unknown i be apt to think that angels have now and the spirit of just men make perfect shall have in a future state of thousands of things which now either wholly escape our apprehensions or which our shortsighted reason have get some faint glimpse of we in the dark grope after the next be get by reason but though we have here and there a little of this clear light some spark of bright knowledge yet the greatest part of our ideas be such that we can not discern their agreement or disagreement by an immediate compare them and in all these we have need of reason and must by discourse and inference make our discoveries now of these there be two sort which i shall take the liberty to mention here again through reason that be demonstrative first those whose agreement or disagreement though it can not be see by an immediate put them together yet may be examine by the intervention of other ideas which can be compare with them in this case when the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea on both side with those which we would compare be plainly discern there it amount to demonstration whereby knowledge be produce which though it be certain yet it be not so easy nor altogether so clear as intuitive knowledge because in that there be barely one simple intuition wherein there be no room for any the least mistake or doubt the truth be see all perfectly at once in demonstration it be true there be intuition too but not altogether at once for there must be a remembrance of the intuition of the agreement of the medium or intermediate idea with that we compare it with before when we compare it with the other and where there be many mediums there the danger of the mistake be the greater for each agreement or disagreement of the ideas must be observe and see in each step of the whole train and retain in the memory just as it be and the mind must be sure that no part of what be necessary to make up the demonstration be omit or overlook this make some demonstrations long and perplex and too hard for those who have not strength of part distinctly to perceive and exactly carry so many particulars orderly in their head and even those who be able to master such intricate speculations be fain sometimes to go over them again and there be need of more than one review before they can arrive at certainty but yet where the mind clearly retain the intuition it have of the agreement of any idea with another and that with a third and that with a fourth c there the agreement of the first and the fourth be a demonstration and produce certain knowledge which may be call rational knowledge as the other be intuitive to supply the narrowness of demonstrative and intuitive knowledge we have nothing but judgment upon probable reason secondly there be other ideas whose agreement or disagreement can no otherwise be judge of but by the intervention of others which have not a certain agreement with the extremes but an usual or likely one and in these it be that the judgment be properly exercise which be the acquiesce of the mind that any ideas do agree by compare them with such probable mediums this though it never amount to knowledge no not to that which be the lowest degree of it yet sometimes the intermediate ideas tie the extremes so firmly together and the probability be so clear and strong that assent as necessarily follow it as knowledge do demonstration the great excellency and use of the judgment be to observe right and take a true estimate of the force and weight of each probability and then cast them up all right together choose that side which have the overbalance intuitive knowledge be the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately compare together rational knowledge be the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by the intervention of one or more other ideas judgment be the think or take two ideas to agree or disagree by the intervention of one or more ideas whose certain agreement or disagreement with them it do not perceive but hath observe to be frequent and usual consequences of word and consequences of ideas though the deduce one proposition from another or make inferences in word be a great part of reason and that which it be usually employ about yet the principal act of ratiocination be the find the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another by the intervention of a third as a man by a yard find two house to be of the same length to measure their equality by juxtaposition word have their consequences as the sign of such ideas and things agree or disagree as really they be but we observe it only by our ideas four sort of arguments before we quit this subject it may be worth our while a little to reflect on four sort of arguments that men in their reason with others do ordinarily make use of to prevail on their assent or at least to awe them as to silence their opposition i argumentum ad verecundiam the first be to allege the opinions of men whose part learn eminency power or some other cause have gain a name and settle their reputation in the common esteem with some kind of authority when men be establish in any kind of dignity it be think a breach of modesty for others to derogate any way from it and question the authority of men who be in possession of it this be apt to be censure as carry with it too much pride when a man do not readily yield to the determination of approve author which be wont to be receive with respect and submission by others and it be look upon as insolence for a man to set up and adhere to his own opinion against the current stream of antiquity or to put it in the balance against that of some learn doctor or otherwise approve writer whoever back his tenets with such authorities think he ought thereby to carry the cause and be ready to style it impudence in any one who shall stand out against them this i think may be call argumentum ad verecundiam ii argumentum ad ignorantiam secondly another way that men ordinarily use to drive others and force them to submit to their judgments and receive their opinion in debate be to require the adversary to admit what they allege as a proof or to assign a better and this i call argumentum ad ignorantiam iii argumentum ad hominem thirdly a third way be to press a man with consequences draw from his own principles or concessions this be already know under the name of argumentum ad hominem iv argumentum adjudicium the fourth alone advance us in knowledge and judgment the fourth be the use of proof draw from any of the foundations of knowledge or probability this i call argumentum adjudicium this alone of all the four bring true instruction with it and advance us in our way to knowledge for it argue not another man opinion to be right because i out of respect or any other consideration but that of conviction will not contradict him it prove not another man to be in the right way nor that i ought to take the same with him because i know not a better nor do it follow that another man be in the right way because he have show me that i be in the wrong i may be modest and therefore not oppose another man persuasion i may be ignorant and not be able to produce a better i may be in an error and another may show me that i be so this may dispose me perhaps for the reception of truth but help me not to it that must come from proof and arguments and light arise from the nature of things themselves and not from my shamefacedness ignorance or error above contrary and accord to reason by what have be before say of reason we may be able to make some guess at the distinction of things into those that be accord to above and contrary to reason accord to reason be such proposition whose truth we can discover by examine and trace those ideas we have from sensation and reflection and by natural deduction find to be true or probable above reason be such proposition whose truth or probability we can not by reason derive from those principles contrary to reason be such proposition as be inconsistent with or irreconcilable to our clear and distinct ideas thus the existence of one god be accord to reason the existence of more than one god contrary to reason the resurrection of the dead above reason above reason also may be take in a double sense viz either as signify above probability or above certainty and in that large sense also contrary to reason be i suppose sometimes take reason and faith not opposite for faith must be regulate by reason there be another use of the word reason wherein it be oppose to faith which though it be in itself a very improper way of speak yet common use have so authorize it that it would be folly either to oppose or hope to remedy it only i think it may not be amiss to take notice that however faith be oppose to reason faith be nothing but a firm assent of the mind which if it be regulate as be our duty can not be afford to anything but upon good reason and so can not be opposite to it he that believe without have any reason for believe may be in love with his own fancy but neither seek truth as he ought nor pay the obedience due to his maker who would have him use those discern faculties he have give him to keep him out of mistake and error he that do not this to the best of his power however he sometimes light on truth be in the right but by chance and i know not whether the luckiness of the accident will excuse the irregularity of his proceed this at least be certain that he must be accountable for whatever mistake he run into whereas he that make use of the light and faculties god have give him and seek sincerely to discover truth by those help and abilities he have may have this satisfaction in do his duty as a rational creature that though he should miss truth he will not miss the reward of it for he govern his assent right and place it as he should who in any case or matter whatsoever believe or disbelieve accord as reason direct him he that doth otherwise transgress against his own light and misuse those faculties which be give him to no other end but to search and follow the clearer evidence and greater probability but since reason and faith be by some men oppose we will so consider them in the follow chapter of faith and reason and their distinct provinces necessary to know their boundaries it have be above show that we be of necessity ignorant and want knowledge of all sort where we want ideas that we be ignorant and want rational knowledge where we want proof that we want certain knowledge and certainty as far as we want clear and determine specific ideas that we want probability to direct our assent in matter where we have neither knowledge of our own nor testimony of other men to bottom our reason upon from these things thus premise i think we may come to lay down the measure and boundaries between faith and reason the want whereof may possibly have be the cause if not of great disorder yet at least of great dispute and perhaps mistake in the world for till it be resolve how far we be to be guide by reason and how far by faith we shall in vain dispute and endeavour to convince one another in matter of religion faith and reason what as contradistinguish i find every sect as far as reason will help them make use of it gladly and where it fail them they cry out it be matter of faith and above reason and i do not see how they can argue with any one or ever convince a gainsayer who make use of the same plea without set down strict boundaries between faith and reason which ought to be the first point establish in all question where faith have anything to do reason therefore here as contradistinguish to faith i take to be the discovery of the certainty or probability of such proposition or truths which the mind arrive at by deduction make from such ideas which it have get by the use of its natural faculties viz by sensation or reflection faith on the other side be the assent to any proposition not thus make out by the deductions of reason but upon the credit of the proposer as come from god in some extraordinary way of communication this way of discover truths to men we call revelation no new simple idea can be convey by traditional revelation first then i say that no man inspire by god can by any revelation communicate to others any new simple ideas which they have not before from sensation or reflection for whatsoever impressions he himself may have from the immediate hand of god this revelation if it be of new simple ideas can not be convey to another either by word or any other sign because word by their immediate operation on us cause no other ideas but of their natural sound and it be by the custom of use them for sign that they excite and revive in our mind latent ideas but yet only such ideas as be there before for word see or hear recall to our thoughts those ideas only which to us they have be wont to be sign of but can not introduce any perfectly new and formerly unknown simple ideas the same hold in all other sign which can not signify to us things of which we have before never have any idea at all thus whatever things be discover to st paul when he be rapt up into the third heaven whatever new ideas his mind there receive all the description he can make to others of that place be only this that there be such things as eye hath not see nor ear hear nor hath it enter into the heart of man to conceive and suppose god should discover to any one supernaturally a species of creatures inhabit for example jupiter or saturn for that it be possible there may be such nobody can deny which have six sense and imprint on his mind the ideas convey to theirs by that sixth sense he could no more by word produce in the mind of other men those ideas imprint by that sixth sense than one of us could convey the idea of any colour by the sound of word into a man who have the other four sense perfect have always totally want the fifth of see for our simple ideas then which be the foundation and sole matter of all our notions and knowledge we must depend wholly on our reason i mean our natural faculties and can by no mean receive them or any of them from traditional revelation i say traditional revelation in distinction to original revelation by the one i mean that first impres sion which be make immediately by god on the mind of any man to which we can not set any bound and by the other those impressions deliver over to others in word and the ordinary ways of convey our conceptions one to another traditional revelation may make us know proposition knowable also by reason but not with the same certainty that reason doth secondly i say that the same truths may be discover and convey down from revelation which be discoverable to us by reason and by those ideas we naturally may have so god might by revelation discover the truth of any proposition in euclid as well as men by the natural use of their faculties come to make the discovery themselves in all things of this kind there be little need or use of revelation god have furnish us with natural and surer mean to arrive at the knowledge of them for whatsoever truth we come to the clear discovery of from the knowledge and contemplation of our own ideas will always be certainer to us than those which be convey to us by traditional revelation for the knowledge we have that this revelation come at first from god can never be so sure as the knowledge we have from the clear and distinct perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas vg if it be reveal some age since that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right ones i might assent to the truth of that proposition upon the credit of that tradition that it be reveal but that would never amount to so great a certainty as the knowledge of it upon the compare and measure my own ideas of two right angle and the three angle of a triangle the like hold in matter of fact knowable by our sense vg the history of the deluge be convey to us by write which have their original from revelation and yet nobody i think will say he have as certain and clear a knowledge of the flood as noah that saw it or that he himself would have have have he then be alive and see it for he have no greater an assurance than that of his sense that it be writ in the book suppose writ by moses inspire but he have not so great an assurance that moses write that book as if he have see moses write it so that the assurance of its be a revelation be less still than the assurance of his sense even original revelation can not be admit against the clear evidence of reason in proposition then whose certainty be build upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas attain either by immediate intuition as in selfevident proposition or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of revelation as necessary to gain our assent and introduce them into our mind because the natural ways of knowledge could settle them there or have do it already which be the greatest assurance we can possibly have of anything unless where god immediately reveal it to us and there too our assurance can be no greater than our knowledge be that it be a revelation from god but yet nothing i think can under that title shake or overrule plain knowledge or rationally prevail with any man to admit it for true in a direct contradiction to the clear evidence of his own understand for since no evidence of our faculties by which we receive such revelations can exceed if equal the certainty of our intuitive knowledge we can never receive for a truth anything that be directly contrary to our clear and distinct knowledge vg the ideas of one body and one place do so clearly agree and the mind have so evident a perception of their agreement that we can never assent to a proposition that affirm the same body to be in two distant place at once however it should pretend to the authority of a divine revelation since the evidence first that we deceive not ourselves in ascribe it to god secondly that we understand it right can never be so great as the evidence of our own intuitive knowledge whereby we discern it impossible for the same body to be in two place at once and therefore no proposition can be receive for divine revelation or obtain the assent due to all such if it be contradictory to our clear intuitive knowledge because this would be to subvert the principles and foundations of all knowledge evidence and assent whatsoever and there would be leave no difference between truth and falsehood no measure of credible and incredible in the world if doubtful proposition shall take place before selfevident and what we certainly know give way to what we may possibly be mistake in in proposition therefore contrary to the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas it will be in vain to urge them as matter of faith they can not move our assent under that or any other title whatsoever for faith can never convince us of anything that contradict our knowledge because though faith be found on the testimony of god who can not lie reveal any proposition to us yet we can not have an assurance of the truth of its be a divine revelation greater than our own knowledge since the whole strength of the certainty depend upon our knowledge that god reveal it which in this case where the proposition suppose reveal contradict our knowledge or reason will always have this objection hang to it viz that we can not tell how to conceive that to come from god the bountiful author of our be which if receive for true must overturn all the principles and foundations of knowledge he have give us render all our faculties useless wholly destroy the most excellent part of his workmanship our understand and put a man in a condition wherein he will have less light less conduct than the beast that perisheth for if the mind of man can never have a clearer and perhaps not so clear evidence of anything to be a divine revelation as it have of the principles of its own reason it can never have a grind to quit the clear evidence of its reason to give a place to a proposition whose revelation have not a greater evidence than those principles have traditional revelation much less thus far a man have use of reason and ought to hearken to it even in immediate and original revelation where it be suppose to be make to himself but to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation but be require to pay obedience and to receive the truths reveal to others which by the tradition of write or word of mouth be convey down to them reason have a great deal more to do and be that only which can induce us to receive them for matter of faith be only divine revelation and nothing else faith as we use the word call commonly divine faith have to do with no proposition but those which be suppose to be divinely reveal so that i do not see how those who make revelation alone the sole object of faith can say that it be a matter of faith and not of reason to believe that such or such a proposition to be find in such or such a book be of divine inspiration unless it be reveal that that proposition or all in that book be communicate by divine inspiration without such a revelation the believe or not believe that proposition or book to be of divine authority can never be matter of faith but matter of reason and such as i must come to an assent to only by the use of my reason which can never require or enable me to believe that which be contrary to itself it be impossible for reason ever to procure any assent to that which to itself appear unreasonable in all things therefore where we have clear evidence from our ideas and those principles of knowledge i have above mention reason be the proper judge and revelation though it may in consent with it confirm its dictate yet can not in such case invalidate its decree nor can we be oblige where we have the clear and evident sentience of reason to quit it for the contrary opinion under a pretence that it be matter of faith which can have no authority against the plain and clear dictate of reason things above reason be when reveal the proper matter of faith but thirdly there be many things wherein we have very imperfect notions or none at all and other things of whose past present or future existence by the natural use of our faculties we can have no knowledge at all these as be beyond the discovery of our natural faculties and above reason be when reveal the proper matter of faith thus that part of the angels rebel against god and thereby lose their first happy state and that the dead shall rise and live again these and the like be beyond the discovery of reason be purely matter of faith with which reason have directly nothing to do or not contrary to reason if reveal be matter of faith and must carry it against probable conjecture of reason but since god in give us the light of reason have not thereby tie up his own hand from afford us when he think fit the light of revelation in any of those matter wherein our natural faculties be able to give a probable determination revelation where god have be please to give it must carry it against the probable conjecture of reason because the mind not be certain of the truth of that it do not evidently know but only yield to the probability that appear in it be bind to give up its assent to such a testimony which it be satisfy come from one who can not err and will not deceive but yet it still belong to reason to judge of the truth of its be a revelation and of the signification of the word wherein it be deliver indeed if anything shall be think revelation which be contrary to the plain principles of reason and the evident knowledge the mind have of its own clear and distinct ideas there reason must be hearken to as to a matter within its province since a man can never have so certain a knowledge that a proposition which contradict the clear principles and evidence of his own knowledge be divinely reveal or that he understand the word rightly wherein it be deliver as he have that the contrary be true and so be bind to consider and judge of it as a matter of reason and not swallow it without examination as a matter of faith revelation in matter where reason can not judge or but probably ought to be hearken to first whatever proposition be reveal of whose truth our mind by its natural faculties and notions can not judge that be purely matter of faith and above reason secondly all proposition whereof the mind by the use of its natural faculties can come to determine and judge from naturally acquire ideas be matter of reason with this difference still that in those concern which it have but an uncertain evidence and so be persuade of their truth only upon probable ground which still admit a possibility of the contrary to be true without do violence to the certain evidence of its own knowledge and overturn the principles of all reason in such probable proposition i say an evident revelation ought to determine our assent even against probability for where the principles of reason have not evidence a proposition to be certainly true or false there clear revelation as another principle of truth and grind of assent may determine and so it may be matter of faith and be also above reason because reason in that particular matter be able to reach no higher than probability faith give the determination where reason come short and revelation discover on which side the truth lay in matter where reason can afford certain knowledge that be to be hearken to thus far the dominion of faith reach and that without any violence or hindrance to reason which be not injure or disturb but assist and improve by new discoveries of truth come from the eternal fountain of all knowledge whatever god hath reveal be certainly true no doubt can be make of it this be the proper object of faith but whether it be a divine revelation or no reason must judge which can never permit the mind to reject a greater evidence to embrace what be less evident nor allow it to entertain probability in opposition to knowledge and certainty there can be no evidence that any traditional revelation be of divine original in the word we receive it and in the sense we understand it so clear and so certain as that of the principles of reason and therefore nothing that be contrary to and inconsistent with the clear and selfevident dictate of reason have a right to he urge or assent to as a matter of faith wherein reason hath nothing to do whatsoever be divine revelation ought to overrule all our opinions prejudice and interest and hath a right to be receive with full assent such a submission as this of our reason to faith take not away the landmarks of knowledge this shake not the foundations of reason but leave us that use of our faculties for which they be give us if the boundaries be not set between faith and reason no enthusiasm or extravagancy in religion can be contradict if the provinces of faith and reason be not keep distinct by these boundaries there will in matter of religion be no room for reason at all and those extravagant opinions and ceremonies that be to be find in the several religions of the world will not deserve to be blame for to this cry up of faith in opposition to reason we may i think in good measure ascribe those absurdities that fill almost all the religions which possess and divide mankind for men have be principled with an opinion that they must not consult reason in the things of religion however apparently contradictory to common sense and the very principles of all their knowledge have let loose their fancy and natural superstition and have be by them lead into so strange opinions and extravagant practice in religion that a considerate man can not but stand amaze at their follies and judge them so far from be acceptable to the great and wise god that he can not avoid think them ridiculous and offensive to a sober good man so that in effect religion which should most distinguish us from beasts and ought most peculiarly to elevate us as rational creatures above brutes be that wherein men often appear most irrational and more senseless than beasts themselves credo quia impossibile est i believe because it be impossible might in a good man pass for a sally of zeal but would prove a very ill rule for men to choose their opinions or religion by of enthusiasm love of truth necessary he that would seriously set upon the search of truth ought in the first place to prepare his mind with a love of it for he that love it not will not take much pain to get it nor be much concern when he miss it there be nobody in the commonwealth of learn who do not profess himself a lover of truth and there be not a rational creature that would not take it amiss to be think otherwise of and yet for all this one may truly say that there be very few lovers of truth for truths sake even amongst those who persuade themselves that they be so how a man may know whether he be so in earnest be worth inquiry and i think there be one unerring mark of it viz the not entertain any proposition with greater assurance than the proof it be build upon will warrant whoever go beyond this measure of assent it be plain receive not the truth in the love of it love not truth for truths sake but for some other byeend for the evidence that any proposition be true except such as be selfevident lie only in the proof a man have of it whatsoever degrees of assent he afford it beyond the degrees of that evidence it be plain that all the surplusage of assurance be owe to some other affec tion and not to the love of truth it be as impossible that the love of truth should carry my assent above the evidence there be to me that it be true as that the love of truth should make me assent to any proposition for the sake of that evidence which it have not that it be true which be in effect to love it as a truth because it be possible or probable that it may not be true in any truth that get not possession of our mind by the irresistible light of selfevidence or by the force of demonstration the arguments that gain it assent be the vouchers and gage of its probability to us and we can receive it for no other than such as they deliver it to our understand whatsoever credit or authority we give to any proposition more than it receive from the principles and proof it support itself upon be owe to our inclinations that way and be so far a derogation from the love of truth as such which as it can receive no evidence from our passions or interest so it should receive no tincture from them a forwardness to dictate anothers beliefs from whence the assume an authority of dictate to others and a forwardness to prescribe to their opinions be a constant concomitant of this bias and corruption of our judgments for how almost can it be otherwise but that he should be ready to impose on anothers belief who have already impose on his own who can reasonably expect arguments and conviction from him in deal with others whose understand be not accustom to them in his deal with himself who do violence to his own faculties tyrannize over his own mind and usurp the prerogative that belong to truth alone which be to command assent by only its own authority ie by and in proportion to that evidence which it carry with it force of enthusiasm in which reason be take away upon this occasion i shall take the liberty to consider a third grind of assent which with some men have the same authority and be as confidently rely on as either faith or reason i mean enthusiasm which lay by reason would set up revelation without it whereby in effect it take away both reason and revelation and substitute in the room of them the ungrounded fancy of a man own brain and assume them for a founda tion both of opinion and conduct reason and revelation reason be natural revelation whereby the eternal father of light and fountain of all knowledge communicate to mankind that portion of truth which he have lay within the reach of their natural faculties revelation be natural reason enlarge by a new set of discoveries communicate by god immediately which reason vouch the truth of by the testimony and proof it give that they come from god so that he that take away reason to make way for revelation put out the light of both and do much what the same as if he would persuade a man to put out his eye the better to receive the remote light of an invisible star by a telescope rise of enthusiasm immediate revelation be a much easier way for men to establish their opinions and regulate their conduct than the tedious and not always successful labour of strict reason it be no wonder that some have be very apt to pretend to revelation and to persuade themselves that they be under the peculiar guidance of heaven in their action and opinions especially in those of them which they can not account for by the ordinary methods of knowledge and principles of reason hence we see that in all age men in whom melancholy have mix with devotion or whose conceit of themselves have raise them into an opinion of a greater familiarity with god and a nearer admittance to his favour than be afford to others have often flatter themselves with a persuasion of an immediate intercourse with the deity and frequent communications from the divine spirit god i own can not be deny to be able to enlighten the understand by a ray dart into the mind immediately from the fountain of light this they understand he have promise to do and who then have so good a title to expect it as those who be his peculiar people choose by him and depend on him enthusiastic impulse their mind be thus prepare whatever groundless opinion come to settle itself strongly upon their fancy be an illumination from the spirit of god and presently of divine authority and whatsoever odd action they find in themselves a strong inclination to do that impulse be conclude to be a call or direction from heaven and must be obey it be a commission from above and they can not err in execute it what be mean by enthusiasm this i take to be properly enthusiasm which though found neither on reason nor divine revelation but rise from the conceits of a warm or overweening brain work yet where it once get foot more powerfully on the persuasions and action of men than either of those two or both together men be most forwardly obedient to the impulses they receive from themselves and the whole man be sure to act more vigorously where the whole man be carry by a natural motion for strong conceit like a new principle carry all easily with it when get above common sense and free from all restraint of reason and check of reflection it be heighten into a divine authority in concurrence with our own temper and inclination enthusiasm accept its suppose illumination without search and proof though the odd opinions and extravagant action enthusiasm have run men into be enough to warn them against this wrong principle so apt to misguide them both in their belief and conduct yet the love of something extraordinary the ease and glory it be to be inspire and be above the common and natural ways of knowledge so flatter many mens laziness ignorance and vanity that when once they be get into this way of immediate revelation of illumination without search and of certainty without proof and without examination it be a hard matter to get them out of it reason be lose upon them they be above it they see the light infuse into their understand and can not be mistake it be clear and visible there like the light of bright sunshine show itself and need no other proof but its own evidence they feel the hand of god move them within and the impulses of the spirit and can not be mistake in what they feel thus they support themselves and be sure reason hath nothing to do with what they see and feel in themselves what they have a sensible experience of admit no doubt need no probation would he not be ridiculous who should require to have it prove to him that the light shin and that he see it it be its own proof and can have no other when the spirit bring light into our mind it dispel darkness we see it as we do that of the sun at noon and need not the twilight of reason to show it us this light from heaven be strong clear and pure carry its own demonstration with it and we may as naturally take a glowworm to assist us to discover the sun as to examine the celestial ray by our dim candle reason enthusiasm how to be discover this be the way of talk of these men they be sure because they be sure and their persuasions be right because they be strong in them for when what they say be strip of the metaphor of see and feel this be all it amount to and yet these similes so impose on them that they serve them for certainty in themselves and demonstration to others the suppose internal light examine but to examine a little soberly this internal light and this feel on which they build so much these men have they say clear light and they see they have awaken sense and they feel this can not they be sure be dispute them for when a man say he see or feel nobody can deny him that he do so but here let me ask this see be it the perception of the truth of the proposition or of this that it be a revelation from god this feel be it a perception of an inclination or fancy to do something or of the spirit of god move that inclination these be two very different perceptions and must be carefully distinguish if we would not impose upon ourselves i may perceive the truth of a proposition and yet not perceive that it be an immediate revelation from god i may perceive the truth of a proposition in euclid without its be or my perceive it to be a revelation nay i may perceive i come not by this knowledge in a natural way and so may conclude it reveal without perceive that it be a revelation of god because there be spirit which without be divinely commission may excite those ideas in me and lay them in such order before my mind that i may perceive their connexion so that the knowledge of any proposition come into my mind i know not how be not a perception that it be from god much less be a strong persuasion that it be true a perception that it be from god or so much as true but however it be call light and see i suppose it be at most but belief and assurance and the proposition take for a revelation be not such as they know to be true but take to be true for where a proposition be know to be true revelation be needle and it be hard to conceive how there can be a revelation to any one of what he know already if therefore it be a proposition which they be persuade but do not know to be true whatever they may call it it be not see but believe for these be two ways whereby truth come into the mind wholly distinct so that one be not the other what i see i know to be so by the evidence of the thing itself what i believe i take to be so upon the testimony of another but this testimony i must know to be give or else what grind have i of believe i must see that it be god that reveal this to me or else i see nothing the question then here be how do i know that god be the revealer of this to me that this impression be make upon my mind by his holy spirit and that therefore i ought to obey it if i know not this how great soever the assurance be that i be possess with it be groundless whatever light i pretend to it be but enthusiasm for whether the proposition suppose to be reveal be in itself evidently true or visibly probable or by the natural ways of knowledge uncertain the proposition that must be well ground and manifest to be true be this that god be the revealer of it and that what i take to be a revelation be certainly put into my mind by him and be not an illusion drop in by some other spirit or raise by my own fancy for if i mistake not these men receive it for true because they presume god reveal it do it not then stand them upon to examine upon what ground they presume it to be a revelation from god or else all their confidence be mere presumption and this light they be so dazzle with be nothing but an ignis fatuus that lead them constantly round in this circle it be a revelation because they firmly believe it and they believe it because it be a revelation enthusiasm fail of evidence that the proposition be from god in all that be of divine revelation there be need of no other proof but that it be an inspiration from god for he can neither deceive nor be deceive but how shall it be know that any proposition in our mind be a truth infuse by god a truth that be reveal to us by him which he declare to us and therefore we ought to believe here it be that enthusiasm fail of the evidence it pretend to for men thus possess boast of a light whereby they say they be enlighten and bring into the knowledge of this or that truth but if they know it to be a truth they must know it to be so either by its own selfevidence to natural reason or by the rational proof that make it out to be so if they see and know it to be a truth either of these two ways they in vain suppose it to be a revelation for they know it to be true the same way that any other man naturally may know that it be so without the help of revelation for thus all the truths of what kind soever that men uninspired be enlighten with come into their mind and be establish there if they say they know it to be true be cause it be a revelation from god the reason be good but then it will be demand how they know it to be a revelation from god if they say by the light it bring with it which shin bright in their mind and they can not resist i beseech them to consider whether this be any more than what we have take notice of already viz that it be a revelation because they strongly believe it to be true for all the light they speak of be but a strong though ungrounded persuasion of their own mind that it be a truth for rational ground from proof that it be a truth they must acknowledge to have none for then it be not receive as a revelation but upon the ordinary ground that other truths be receive and if they believe it to be true because it be a revelation and have no other reason for its be a revelation but because they be fully persuade without any other reason that it be true then they believe it to be a revelation only because they strongly believe it to be a revelation which be a very unsafe grind to proceed on either in our tenets or action and what readier way can there be to run ourselves into the most extravagant errors and miscarriages than thus to set up fancy for our supreme and sole guide and to believe any proposition to be true any action to be right only because we believe it to be so the strength of our persuasions be no evidence at all of their own rectitude crook things may be as stiff and inflexible as straight and men may be as positive and peremptory in error as in truth how come else the untractable zealots in different and opposite party for if the light which every one think he have in his mind which in this case be nothing but the strength of his own persuasion be an evidence that it be from god contrary opinions have the same title to be inspirations and god will be not only the father of light but of opposite and contradictory light lead men contrary ways and contradictory proposition will be divine truths if an ungrounded strength of assurance be an evidence that any proposition be a divine revelation firmness of persuasion no proof that any proposition be from god this can not be otherwise whilst firmness of persuasion be make the cause of believe and confidence of be in the right be make an argument of truth st paul himself believe he do well and that he have a call to it when he persecute the christians whom he confidently think in the wrong but yet it be he and not they who be mistake good men be men still liable to mistake and be sometimes warmly engage in errors which they take for divine truths shin in their mind with the clearest light light in the mind what light true light in the mind be or can be nothing else but the evidence of the truth of any proposition and if it be not a selfevident proposition all the light it have or can have be from the clearness and validity of those proof upon which it be receive to talk of any other light in the understand be to put ourselves in the dark or in the power of the prince of darkness and by our own consent to give ourselves up to delusion to believe a lie for if strength of persuasion be the light which must guide us i ask how shall any one distinguish between the delusions of satan and the inspirations of the holy ghost he can transform himself into an angel of light and they who be lead by this son of the morning be as fully satisfy of the illumination ie be as strongly persuade that they be en lighten by the spirit of god as any one who be so they acquiesce and rejoice in it be actuate by it and nobody can be more sure nor more in the right if their own belief may be judge than they revelation must be judge of by reason he therefore that will not give himself up to all the extravagances of delusion and error must bring this guide of his light within to the trial god when he make the prophet do not unmake the man he leave all his faculties in the natural state to enable him to judge of his inspirations whether they be of divine original or no when he illuminate the mind with supernatural light he do not extinguish that which be natural if he would have us assent to the truth of any proposition he either evidence that truth by the usual methods of natural reason or else make it know to be a truth which he would have us assent to by his authority and convince us that it be from him by some mark which reason can not be mistake in reason must be our last judge and guide in everything i do not mean that we must consult reason and examine whether a proposition reveal from god can be make out by natural principles and if it can not that then we may reject it but consult it we must and by it examine whether it be a revelation from god or no and if reason find it to be reveal from god reason then declare for it as much as for any other truth and make it one of her dictate every conceit that thoroughly warm our fancy must pass for an inspiration if there be nothing but the strength of our persuasions whereby to judge of our persuasions if reason must not examine their truth by something extrinsical to the persuasions themselves inspirations and delusions truth and falsehood will have the same measure and will not be possible to be distinguish belief no proof of revelation if this internal light or any proposition which under that title we take for inspire be conformable to the principles of reason or to the word of god which be attest revelation reason warrant it and we may safely receive it for true and be guide by it in our belief and action if it receive no testimony nor evidence from either of these rule we can not take it for a revelation or so much as for true till we have some other mark that it be a revelation besides our believe that it be so thus we see the holy men of old who have revelations from god have something else besides that internal light of assurance in their own mind to testify to them that it be from god they be not leave to their own persuasions alone that those persuasions be from god but have outward sign to convince them of the author of those revelations and when they be to convince others they have a power give them to justify the truth of their commission from heaven and by visible sign to assert the divine authority of a message they be send with moses saw the bush burn without be consume and hear a voice out of it this be something besides find an impulse upon his mind to go to pharaoh that he might bring his brethren out of egypt and yet he think not this enough to authorize him to go with that message till god by another miracle of his rod turn into a serpent have assure him of a power to testify his mission by the same miracle repeat before them whom he be send to gideon be send by an angel to deliver israel from the midianites and yet he desire a sign to convince him that this commission be from god these and several the like instance to be find among the prophets of old be enough to show that they think not an inward see or persuasion of their own mind without any other proof a sufficient evidence that it be from god though the scripture do not everywhere mention their demand or have such proof criteria of a divine revelation in what i have say i be far from deny that god can or doth sometimes enlighten mens mind in the apprehend of certain truths or excite them to good action by the immediate influence and assistance of the holy spirit without any extraordinary sign accompany it but in such case too we have reason and scripture unerring rule to know whether it be from god or no where the truth embrace be consonant to the revelation in the write word of god or the action conformable to the dictate of right reason or holy writ we may be assure that we run no risk in entertain it as such because though perhaps it be not an immediate revelation from god extraordinarily operate on our mind yet we be sure it be warrant by that revelation which he have give us of truth but it be not the strength of our private persuasion within ourselves that can warrant it to be a light or motion from heaven nothing can do that but the write word of god without us or that standard of reason which be common to us with all men where reason or scripture be express for any opinion or action we may receive it as of divine authority but it be not the strength of our own persuasions which can by itself give it that stamp the bend of our own mind may favour it as much as we please that may show it to be a fondle of our own but will by no mean prove it to be an offspring of heaven and of divine original of wrong assent or error cause of error or how men come to give assent contrary to probability knowledge be to be have only of visible and certain truth error be not a fault of our knowledge but a mistake of our judgment give assent to that which be not true but if assent be ground on likelihood if the proper object and motive of our assent be probability and that probability consist in what be lay down in the forego chapters it will be demand how men come to give their assent contrary to probability for there be nothing more common than contrariety of opinions nothing more obvious than that one man wholly disbelieve what another only doubt of and a third stedfastly believe and firmly adhere to the reason whereof though they may be very various yet i suppose may all be reduce to these four i want of proof ii want of ability to use them iii want of will to see them iv wrong measure of probability first cause of error want of proof first by want of proof i do not mean only the want of those proof which be nowhere extant and so be nowhere to be have but the want even of those proof which be in be or might be procure and thus men want proof who have not the convenience or opportunity to make experiment and observations themselves tend to the proof of any proposition nor likewise the convenience to inquire into and collect the testimonies of others and in this state be the greatest part of mankind who be give up to labour and enslave to the necessity of their mean condition whose live be wear out only in the provision for live these mens opportunities of knowledge and inquiry be commonly as narrow as their fortunes and their understand be but little instruct when all their whole time and pain be lay out to still the croak of their own belly or the cry of their children it be not to be expect that a man who drudge on all his life in a laborious trade should be more know in the variety of things do in the world than a packhorse who be drive constantly forward and backwards in a narrow lane and dirty road only to market should be skilled in the geography of the country nor be it at all more possible that he who want leisure book and languages and the opportunity of converse with variety of men should be in a condition to collect those testimonies and observations which be in be and be necessary to make out many nay most of the proposition that in the societies of men be judge of the greatest moment or to find out ground of assurance so great as the belief of the point he would build on them be think necessary so that a great part of mankind be by the natural and unalterable state of things in this world and the constitution of human affairs unavoidably give over to invincible ignorance of those proof on which others build and which be necessary to establish those opinions the greatest part of men have much to do to get the mean of live be not in a condition to look after those of learn and laborious inquiries objection what shall become of those who want proof answer what shall we say then be the greatest part of mankind by the necessity of their condition subject to unavoidable ignorance in those things which be of greatest importance to them for of those it be obvious to inquire have the bulk of mankind no other guide but accident and blind chance to conduct them to their happiness or misery be the current opinions and license guide of every country sufficient evidence and security to every man to venture his great concernments on nay his everlasting happiness or misery or can those be the certain and infallible oracles and standards of truth which teach one thing in christendom and another in turkey or shall a poor countryman be eternally happy for have the chance to be bear in italy or a daylabourer be unavoidably lose because he have the illluck to be bear in england how ready some men may be to say some of these things i will not here examine but this i be sure that men must allow one or other of these to be true let them choose which they please or else grant that god have furnish men with faculties sufficient to direct them in the way they should take if they will but seriously employ them that way when their ordinary vocations allow them the leisure no man be so wholly take up with the attendance on the mean of live as to have no spare time at all to think of his soul and inform himself in matter of religion be men as intent upon this as they be on things of lower concernment there be none so enslave to the necessities of life who might not find many vacancies that might be husband to this advantage of their knowledge people hinder from inquiry besides those whose improvements and informations be straiten by the narrowness of their fortunes there be others whose largeness of fortune would plentifully enough supply book and other requisites for clear of doubt and discover of truth but they be cooped in close by the laws of their countries and the strict guard of those whose interest it be to keep them ignorant lest know more they should believe the less in them these be as far nay further from the liberty and opportunities of a fair inquiry than these poor and wretched labourers we before speak of and however they may seem high and great be confine to narrowness of think and enslave in that which should be the freest part of man their understand this be generally the case of all those who live in place where care be take to propagate truth without knowledge where men be force at a venture to be of the religion of the country and must therefore swallow down opinions as silly people do empirics pills without know what they be make of or how they will work and have nothing to do but believe that they will do the cure but in this be much more miserable than they in that they be not at liberty to refuse swallow what perhaps they have rather let alone or to choose the physician to whose conduct they would trust themselves second cause of error want of skill to use proof secondly those who want skill to use those evidence they have of probabilities who can not carry a train of consequences in their head nor weigh exactly the preponderancy of contrary proof and testimonies make every circumstance its due allowance may be easily mislead to assent to position that be not probable there be some men of one some but of two syllogisms and no more and others that can but advance one step further these can not always discern that side on which the strongest proof lie can not constantly follow that which in itself be the more probable opinion now that there be such a difference between men in respect of their understand i think nobody who have have any conversation with his neighbour will question though he never be at westminsterhall or the exchange on the one hand nor at almshouses or bedlam on the other which great difference in mens intellectuals whether it rise from any defect in the organs of the body particularly adapt to think or in the dullness or untractableness of those faculties for want of use or as some think in the natural differences of mens souls themselves or some or all of these together it matter not here to examine only this be evident that there be a difference of degrees in mens understand apprehensions and reason to so great a latitude that one may without do injury to mankind affirm that there be a greater distance between some men and others in this respect than between some men and some beasts but how this come about be a speculation though of great consequence yet not necessary to our present purpose third cause of error want of will to use them thirdly there be another sort of people that want proof not because they be out of their reach but because they will not use them who though they have riches and leisure enough and want neither part nor other help be yet never the better for them their hot pursuit of pleasure or constant drudgery in business engage some mens thoughts elsewhere laziness and oscitancy in general or a particular aversion for book study and meditation keep others from any serious thoughts at all and some out of fear that an impartial inquiry would not favour those opinions which best suit their prejudice live and design content themselves without examination to take upon trust what they find convenient and in fashion thus most men even of those that might do otherwise pass their live without an acquaintance with much less a rational assent to probabilities they be concern to know though they lie so much within their view that to be convince of them they need but turn their eye that way we know some men will not read a letter which be suppose to bring ill news and many men forbear to cast up their account or so much as think upon their estates who have reason to fear their affairs be in no very good posture how men whose plentiful fortunes allow them leisure to improve their understand can satisfy themselves with a lazy ignorance i can not tell but methinks they have a low opinion of their souls who lay out all their incomes in provision for the body and employ none of it to procure the mean and help of knowledge who take great care to appear always in a neat and splendid outside and would think themselves miserable in coarse clothe or a patch coat and yet contentedly suffer their mind to appear abroad in a piebald livery of coarse patch and borrow shred such as it have please chance or their country tailor i mean the common opinion of those they have converse with to clothe them in i will not here mention how unreasonable this be for men that ever think of a future state and their concernment in it which no rational man can avoid to do sometimes nor shall i take notice what a shame and confusion it be to the greatest contemners of knowledge to be find ignorant in things they be concern to know but this at least be worth the consideration of those who call themselves gentlemen that however they may think credit respect power and authority the concomitants of their birth and fortune yet they will find all these still carry away from them by men of lower condition who surpass them in knowledge they who be blind will always be lead by those that see or else fall into the ditch and he be certainly the most subject the most enslave who be so in his understand in the forego instance some of the cause have be show of wrong assent and how it come to pass that probable doctrines be not always receive with an assent proportionable to the reason which be to be have for their probability but hitherto we have consider only such probabilities whose proof do exist but do not appear to him who embrace the error fourth cause of error wrong measure of probability fourthly there remain yet the last sort who even where the real probabilities appear and be plainly lay before them do not admit of the conviction nor yield unto manifest reason but do either epechein suspend their assent or give it to the less probable opinion and to this danger be those expose who have take up wrong measure of probability which be i proposition that be not in themselves certain and evident but doubtful and false take up for principles ii receive hypotheses iii predominant passions or inclinations iv authority i doubtful proposition take for principles the first and firmest grind of probability be the conformity anything have to our own knowledge especially that part of our knowledge which we have embrace and continue to look on as principles these have so great an influence upon our opinions that it be usually by them we judge of truth and measure probability to that degree that what be inconsistent with our principles be so far from pass for probable with us that it will not be allow possible the reverence bear to these principles be so great and their authority so paramount to all other that the testimony not only of other men but the evidence of our own sense be often reject when they offer to vouch anything contrary to these establish rule how much the doctrine of innate principles and that principles be not to be prove or question have contribute to this i will not here examine this i readily grant that one truth can not contradict another but withal i take leave also to say that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admit for a principle to examine it strictly and see whether he certainly know it to be true of itself by its own evidence or whether he do only with assurance believe it to be so upon the authority of others for he hath a strong bias put into his understand which will unavoidably misguide his assent who hath imbibe wrong principles and have blindly give himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently true instill in childhood there be nothing more ordinary than childrens receive into their mind proposition especially about matter of religion from their parent nurse or those about them which be insinuate into their unwary as well as unbiassed understand and fasten by degrees be at last equally whether true or false rivet there by long custom and education beyond all possibility of be pull out again for men when they be grow up reflect upon their opinions and find those of this sort to be as ancient in their mind as their very memories not have observe their early insinuation nor by what mean they get them they be apt to reverence them as sacred things and not to suffer them to be profane touch or question they look on them as the urim and thummim set up in their mind immediately by god himself to be the great and unerring deciders of truth and falsehood and the judge to which they be to appeal in all manner of controversies of irresistible efficacy this opinion of his principles let them be what they will be once establish in any ones mind it be easy to be imagine what reception any proposition shall find how clearly soever prove that shall invalidate their authority or at all thwart these internal oracles whereas the grossest absurdities and improbabilities be but agreeable to such principles go down glibly and be easily digest the great obstinacy that be to be find in men firmly believe quite contrary opinions though many time equally absurd in the various religions of mankind be as evident a proof as they be an unavoidable consequence of this way of reason from receive traditional principles so that men will disbelieve their own eye renounce the evidence of their sense and give their own experience the lie rather than admit of anything disagree with these sacred tenets take an intelligent romanist that from the first dawn of any notions in his understand hath have this principle constantly inculcate viz that he must believe as the church ie those of his communion believe or that the pope be infallible and this he never so much as hear question till at forty or fifty years old he meet with one of other principles how be he prepare easily to swallow not only against all probability but even the clear evidence of his sense the doctrine of transubstantiation this principle have such an influence on his mind that he will believe that to be flesh which he see to be bread and what way will you take to convince a man of any improbable opinion he hold who with some philosophers hath lay down this as a foundation of reason that he must believe his reason for so men improperly call arguments draw from their principles against his sense let an enthusiast be principled that he or his teacher be inspire and act by an immediate communication of the divine spirit and you in vain bring the evidence of clear reason against his doctrine whoever therefore have imbibe wrong principles be not in things inconsistent with these principles to be move by the most apparent and convince probabilities till they be so candid and ingenuous to themselves as to be persuade to examine even those very principles which many never suffer themselves to do ii receive hypotheses next to these be men whose understand be cast into a mould and fashion just to the size of a receive hypothesis the difference between these and the former be that they will admit of matter of fact and agree with dissenters in that but differ only in assign of reason and explain the manner of operation these be not at that open defiance with their sense with the former they can endure to hearken to their information a little more patiently but will by no mean admit of their report in the explanation of things nor be prevail on by probabilities which would convince them that things be not bring about just after the same manner that they have decree within themselves that they be would it not be an insufferable thing for a learn professor and that which his scarlet would blush at to have his authority of forty years stand work out of hard rock greek and latin with no small expense of time and candle and confirm by general tradition and a reverend beard in an instant overturn by an upstart novelist can any one expect that he should be make to confess that what he teach his scholars thirty years ago be all error and mistake and that he sell them hard word and ignorance at a very dear rate what probabilities i say be sufficient to prevail in such a case and who ever by the most cogent arguments will be prevail with to disrobe himself at once of all his old opinions and pretences to knowledge and learn which with hard study he hath all this time be labour for and turn himself out stark naked in quest afresh of new notions all the arguments that can be use will be as little able to prevail as the wind do with the traveller to part with his cloak which he hold only the faster to this of wrong hypothesis may be reduce the errors that may be occasion by a true hypothesis or right principles but not rightly understand there be nothing more familiar than this the instance of men contend for different opinions which they all derive from the infallible truth of the scripture be an undeniable proof of it all that call themselves christians allow the text that say metanoeite to carry in it the obligation to a very weighty duty but yet how very erroneous will one of their practice be who understand nothing but the french take this rule with one translation to be repentezvous repent or with the other fatiez penitence do penance iii predominant passions probabilities which cross mens appetites and prevail passions run the same fate let ever so much probability hang on one side of a covetous man reason and money on the other it be easy to foresee which will outweigh earthly mind like mud wall resist the strongest batteries and though perhaps sometimes the force of a clear argument may make some impression yet they nevertheless stand firm and keep out the enemy truth that would captivate or disturb them tell a man passionately in love that he be jilt bring a score of witness of the falsehood of his mistress it be ten to one but three kind word of hers shall invalidate all their testimonies quod volumus facile credimus what suit our wish be forwardly believe be i suppose what every one hath more than once experiment and though men can not always openly gainsay or resist the force of manifest probabilities that make against them yet yield they not to the argument not but that it be the nature of the understand constantly to close with the more probable side but yet a man hath a power to suspend and restrain its inquiries and not permit a full and satisfactory examination as far as the matter in question be capable and will bear it to be make until that be do there will be always these two ways leave of evade the most apparent probabilities two mean of evade probabilities i suppose fallacy latent in the word employ first that the arguments be as for the most part they be bring in word there may be a fallacy latent in them and the consequences be perhaps many in train they may be some of them incoherent there be very few discourse so short clear and consistent to which most men may not with satisfaction enough to themselves raise this doubt and from whose conviction they may not without reproach of disingenuity or unreasonableness set themselves free with the old reply non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris though i can not answer i will not yield suppose unknown arguments for the contrary secondly manifest probabilities may be evade and the assent withhold upon this suggestion that i know not yet all that may he say on the contrary side and therefore though i be beat it be not necessary i should yield not know what force there be in reserve behind this be a refuge against conviction so open and so wide that it be hard to determine when a man be quite out of the verge of it what probabilities naturally determine the assent but yet there be some end of it and a man have carefully inquire into all the ground of probability and unlikeliness do his utmost to inform himself in all particulars fairly and cast up the sum total on both side may in most case come to acknowledge upon the whole matter on which side the probability rest wherein some proof in matter of reason be suppositions upon universal experience be so cogent and clear and some testimonies in matter of fact so universal that he can not refuse his assent so that i think we may conclude that in proposition where though the proof in view be of most moment yet there be sufficient ground to suspect that there be either fallacy in word or certain proof as considerable to be produce on the contrary side there assent suspense or dissent be often voluntary action but where the proof be such as make it highly probable and there be not sufficient grind to suspect that there be either fallacy of word which sober and serious consideration may discover nor equally valid proof yet undiscovered latent on the other side which also the nature of the thing may in some case make plain to a considerate man there i think a man who have weigh them can scarce refuse his assent to the side on which the greater probability appear whether it be probable that a promiscuous jumble of print letter should often fall into a method and order which should stamp on paper a coherent discourse or that a blind fortuitous concourse of atoms not guide by an understand agent should frequently constitute the body of any species of animals in these and the like case i think nobody that consider them can be one jot at a stand which side to take nor at all waver in his assent lastly when there can be no supposition the thing in its own nature in different and wholly depend upon the testimony of witness that there be as fair testimony against as for the matter of fact attest which by inquiry be to be learn vg whether there be one thousand seven hundred years ago such a man at rome as julius caesar in all such case i say i think it be not in any rational man power to refuse his assent but that it necessarily follow and close with such probabilities in other less clear case i think it be in man power to suspend his assent and perhaps content himself with the proof he have if they favour the opinion that suit with his inclination or interest and so stop from further search but that a man should afford his assent to that side on which the less probability appear to him seem to me utterly impracticable and as impossible as it be to believe the same thing probable and improbable at the same time where it be in our power to suspend our judgment as knowledge be no more arbitrary than perception so i think assent be no more in our power than knowledge when the agreement of any two ideas appear to our mind whether immediately or by the assistance of reason i can no more refuse to perceive no more avoid know it than i can avoid see those object which i turn my eye to and look on in daylight and what upon full examination i find the most probable i can not deny my assent to but though we can not hinder our knowledge where the agreement be once perceive nor our assent where the probability manifestly appear upon due consideration of all the measure of it yet we can hinder both knowledge and assent by stop our inquiry and not employ our faculties in the search of any truth if it be not so ignorance error or infidelity could not in any case be a fault thus in some case we can prevent or suspend our assent but can a man verse in modern or ancient history doubt whether there be such a place as rome or whether there be such a man as julius caesar indeed there be millions of truths that a man be not or may not think himself concern to know as whether our king richard the third be crook or no or whether roger bacon be a mathematician or a magician in these and such like case where the assent one way or other be of no importance to the interest of any one no action no concernment of his follow or depend thereon there it be not strange that the mind should give itself up to the common opinion or render itself to the first comer these and the like opinions be of so little weight and moment that like motes in the sun their tendencies be very rarely take notice of they be there as it be by chance and the mind let them float at liberty but where the mind judge that the proposition have concernment in it where the assent or not assent be think to draw consequences of moment after it and good and evil to depend on choose or refuse the right side and the mind set itself seriously to inquire and examine the probability there i think it be not in our choice to take which side we please if manifest odds appear on either the greater probability i think in that case will determine the assent and a man can no more avoid assent or take it to be true where he perceive the greater probability than he can avoid know it to be true where he perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas if this be so the foundation of error will lie in wrong measure of probability as the foundation of vice in wrong measure of good iv authority the fourth and last wrong measure of probability i shall take notice of and which keep in ignorance or error more people than all the other together be that which i have mention in the forego chapter i mean the give up our assent to the common receive opinions either of our friends or party neighbourhood or country how many men have no other grind for their tenets than the suppose honesty or learn or number of those of the same profession as if honest or bookish men could not err or truth be to be establish by the vote of the multitude yet this with most men serve the turn the tenet have have the attestation of reverend antiquity it come to me with the passport of former age and therefore i be secure in the reception i give it other men have be and be of the same opinion for that be all be say and therefore it be reasonable for me to embrace it a man may more justifiably throw up cross and pile for his opin ions than take them up by such measure all men be liable to error and most men be in many point by passion or interest under temptation to it if we could but see the secret motives that influence the men of name and learn in the world and the leaders of party we should not always find that it be the embrace of truth for its own sake that make them espouse the doctrines they own and maintain this at least be certain there be not an opinion so absurd which a man may not receive upon this grind there be no error to be name which have not have its professors and a man shall never want crook paths to walk in if he think that he be in the right way wherever he have the footsteps of others to follow not so many men in errors as be commonly suppose but notwithstanding the great noise be make in the world about errors and opinions i must do mankind that right as to say there be not so many men in errors and wrong opinions as be commonly suppose not that i think they embrace the truth but indeed because concern those doctrines they keep such a stir about they have no think no opinion at all for if any one should a little catechise the greatest part of the partizans of most of the sects in the world he would not find concern those matter they be so zealous for that they have any opinions of their own much less would he have reason to think that they take them upon the examination of arguments and appearance of probability they be resolve to stick to a party that education or interest have engage them in and there like the common soldier of an army show their courage and warmth as their leaders direct without ever examine or so much as know the cause they contend for if a man life show that he have no serious regard for religion for what reason should we think that he beat his head about the opinions of his church and trouble himself to examine the ground of this or that doctrine it be enough for him to obey his leaders to have his hand and his tongue ready for the support of the common cause and thereby approve himself to those who can give him credit preferment or protection in that society thus men become professors of and com batants for those opinions they be never convince of nor proselytes to no nor ever have so much as float in their head and though one can not say there be fewer improbable or erroneous opinions in the world than there be yet this be certain there be fewer that actually assent to them and mistake them for truths than be imagine of the division of the sciences science may be divide into three sort all that can fall within the compass of human understand be either first the nature of things as they be in themselves their relations and their manner of operation or secondly that which man himself ought to do as a rational and voluntary agent for the attainment of any end especially happiness or thirdly the ways and mean whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these be attain and communicate i think science may be divide properly into these three sort physica first the knowledge of things as they be in their own proper be their constitution properties and operations whereby i mean not only matter and body but spirit also which have their proper natures constitutions and operations as well as body this in a little more enlarge sense of the word i call phusike or natural philosophy the end of this be bare speculative truth and whatsoever can afford the mind of man any such fall under this branch whether it be god himself angels spirit body or any of their affections as number and figure c practica secondly praktike the skill of right apply our own power and action for the attainment of things good and useful the most considerable under this head be ethics which be the seek out those rule and measure of human action which lead to happiness and the mean to practise them the end of this be not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth but right and a conduct suitable to it semeiotike thirdly the third branch may be call semeiotike or the doctrine of sign the most usual whereof be word it be aptly enough term also logike logic the business whereof be to consider the nature of sign the mind make use of for the understand of things or convey its knowledge to others for since the things the mind contemplate be none of them besides itself present to the understand it be necessary that something else as a sign or representation of the thing it consider should be present to it and these be ideas and because the scene of ideas that make one man thoughts can not be lay open to the immediate view of another nor lay up anywhere but in the memory a no very sure repository therefore to communicate our thoughts to one another as well as record them for our own use sign of our ideas be also necessary those which men have find most convenient and therefore generally make use of be articulate sound the consideration then of ideas and word as the great instrument of knowledge make no despicable part of their contemplation who would take a view of human knowledge in the whole extent of it and perhaps if they be distinctly weigh and duly consider they would afford us another sort of logic and critic than what we have be hitherto acquaint with this be the first and most general division of the object of our understand this seem to me the first and most general as well as natural division of the object of our understand for a man can employ his thoughts about nothing but either the contemplation of things themselves for the discovery of truth or about the things in his own power which be his own action for the attainment of his own end or the sign the mind make use of both in the one and the other and the right order of them for its clearer information all which three viz things as they be in themselves knowable action as they depend on us in order to happiness and the right use of sign in order to knowledge be toto coelo different they seem to me to be the three great provinces of the intellectual world wholly separate and distinct one from another the endtwo treatises of government in the former the false principles and foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers be detect and overthrow the latter be an essay concern the original extent and end of civil government john locke the preface reader thou hast here the begin and end of a discourse concern government what fate have otherwise dispose of the paper that should have fill up the middle and be more than all the rest it be not worth while to tell thee these which remain i hope be sufficient to establish the throne of our great restorer our present king william to make good his title in else consent of the people which be the only one of all lawful governments he have more fully and clearly than any prince in christendom and to justify to the world the people of england whose love of their just and natural right with their resolution to preserve them save the nation when it war on the very brink of slavery and ruin if these paper have that evidence i flatter myself be to be find in them there will be no great miss of those which be lose and my reader may be satisfy without them for i imagine i shall have neither the time nor inclination to repeat my pain and fill up the want part of my answer by trace sir robert again through all the wind and obscurities which be to be meet with in the several branch of his wonderful system the king and body of the nation have since so thoroughly confute his hypothesis that i suppose nobody hereafter will have either the confidence to appear against our common safety and be again an advocate for slavery or the weakness to be deceive with contradictions dress up in a popular style and well turn periods for if any one will be at the pain himself in those part which be here untouched to strip sir roberts discourse of the flourish of doubtful expressions and endeavour to reduce his word to direct positive intelligible proposition and then compare them one with another he will quickly be satisfy there be never so much glib nonsense put together in well sound english if he think it not worth while to examine his work all through let him make an experiment in that part where he treat of usurpation and let him try whether he can with all his skill make sir robert intelligible and consistent with himself or common sense i should not speak so plainly of a gentleman long since past answer have not the pulpit of late years publicly own his doctrine and make it the current divinity of the time it be necessary those men who take on them to be teachers have so dangerously mislead others should be openly show of what authority this their patriarch be whom they have so blindly follow that so they may either retract what upon so ill ground they have vent and can not be maintain or else justify those principles which they have preach up for gospel though they have no better an author than an english courtier for i should not have writ against sir robert or take the pain to show his mistake inconsistencies and avant of what he so much boast of and pretend wholly to build on scriptureproofs be there not men amongst us who by cry up his book and espouse his doctrine save me from the reproach of write against a dead adversary they have be so zealous in this point that if i have do him any wrong i can not hope they should spare me i wish where they have do the truth and the public wrong they would be as ready to redress it and allow its just weight to this reflection viz that there can not be do a greater mischief to prince and people than the propagate wrong notions concern government that so at last all time might not have reason to complain of the drum ecclesiastic if any one really concern for truth undertake the confutation of my hypothesis i promise him either to recant my mistake upon fair conviction or to answer his difficulties but he must remember two things first that cavil here and there at some expression or little incident of my discourse be not an answer to my book secondly that i shall not take rail for arguments nor think either of these worth my notice though i shall always look on myself as bind to give satisfaction to any one who shall appear to be conscientiously scrupulous in the point and shall show any just ground for his scruple i have nothing more but to advertise the reader that a stand for our author o for his observations on hobbes milton c and that a bare quotation of page always mean page of his patriarcha edit slavery be so vile and miserable an estate of man and so directly opposite to the generous temper and courage of our nation that it be hardly to be conceive that an englishman much less a gentleman should plead for it and truly i should have take sir robert filmers patriarcha as any other treatise which would persuade all mere that they be slave and ought to be so for such another exercise of wit as be his who writ the encomium of nero rather than for a serious discourse mean in earnest have not the gravity of the title and epistle the picture in the front of the book and the applause that follow it require me to believe that the author and publisher be both in earnest i therefore take it into my hand with all the expectation and read it through with all the attention due to a treatise that make such a noise at its come abroad and can not but confess myself mightily surprise that in a book which be to provide chain for all mankind i should find nothing but a rope of sand useful perhaps to such whose skill and business it be to wise a dust and would blind the people the better to mislead them but in truth not of any force to draw those into bondage who have their eye open and so much sense about them as to consider that chain be but an ill wear how much care soever hath be take to file and polish them if any one think i take too much liberty in speak so freely of a man who be the great champion of absolute power and the idol of those who worship it i beseech him to make this small allowance for once to one who even after the read of sir roberts book can not but think himself as the laws allow him a free man and i know no fault it be to do so unless any one better skilled in the fate of it than i should have it reveal to him that this treatise which have lie dormant so long be the false principles and foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers be detect and overthrow plan it appear in the world to carry by strength of its arguments all liberty out or it and that from thenceforth our author short model be to be the pattern in the mount and the perfect standard of politics for the future his system lie in a little compass it be no more but this that all government be absolute monarchy and the grind he build on be this that no man be bear free in this last age a generation of men have spring up amongst us that would flatter princes with an opinion that they have a divine right to absolute power let the laws by which they be constitute and be to govern and the condition under which they enter upon their authority be what they will and their engagements to observe them ever so well ratify by solemn oaths and promise to make way for this doctrine they have deny mankind a right to natural freedom whereby they have not only as much as in them lie expose all subject to the utmost misery of tyranny and oppression but have also unsettle the title and shake the throne of princes for they too by these mens system except only one be all bear slave and by divine right be subject to adams right heir as if they have design to make war upon all government and subvert the very foundations of human society to serve their present turn however we must believe them upon their own bare word when they tell us we be all bear slave and we must continue so there be no remedy for it life and thraldom we enter into together and can never be quit of the one till we part with the other scripture or reason i be sure do not any where say so notwithstanding the noise of divine right as if divine authority hath subject us to the unlimited will of another an admirable state of mankind and that which they have not lead wit enough to find out till this latter age for however sir robert filmier seem to condemn the novelty of the contrary opinion patr p yet i believe it will be hard for him to find any other age or country of the world but this which have assert monarchy to be jure divine and he confess patr p that heyward blackwood barclay and others that have bravely vindicate the right of kings in most point never think of this but with one consent admit the natural liberty and equality of mankind by whom this doctrine come at first to be broach and bring in fashion amongst us and what sad elect it give rise to i leave to historians to relate or to the memory of those who be contemporaries with sibthorp and manwaring to recollect my business at present be only to consider what sir robert filmer who be allow to have carry this argument farthest and be suppose to have bring it to perfection have say in it for from him every one who would be as fashionable as french be at court have learn and run away with this short system of politics viz men be not bear free and therefore could never have the liberty to choose either governors or form of government princes have their power absolute and by divine right for slave could never have a right to compact or consent adam be an absolute monarch and so be all princes ever since of paternal and regal power sir robert filmers great position be that men be not naturally free this be the foundation on which his absolute monarchy stand and from which it erect itself to an height that its power be above every power caput inter nubilia so high above all earthly and human things that think can scarce reach it that promise and oaths which tie the infinite deity can not confine it but if this foundation fail all his fabric fall with it and governments must be leave again to the old way of be make by contrivance and the consent of men anqrwp nh ct sij make use of their reason to unite together into society to prove this grand position of his he tell us p men be bear in subjection to their parent and therefore can not be free and this authority of parent he call royal authority p fatherly authority right of fatherhood p one would have think he would in the begin of such a work as this on which be to depend the authority of princes and the obedience of subject have tell us expressly what that fatherly authority be have definer it though not limit it because in some other treatises of his he tell us it be unlimited and unlimitable he should at least have give us such an account of it that we might have have an entire notion of this fatherhood or fatherly authority whenever it come in our way in his write this i expect to have find in the first chapter of his patriarchal but instead thereof have en passant make his obeisance to the arcana imperii p make his compliment to the right and liberties of this or any other nation p which he be go presently to null and destroy and make his leg to those learn men who do not see so far into the matter as himself p he come to fall on bellarmine p and by a victory over him estab lishes his fatherly authority beyond any question bellarmine be rout by his own confession p the day be clear get and there be no more need of any force for have do that i observe not that he state the question or rally up any arguments to make good his opinion but rather tell us the story as he think fit of this strange kind of domineer phantom call the fatherhood which whoever could catch presently get empire and unlimited absolute power he acquaint us how this fatherhood liege in adam continue its course and keep the world in order all the time of the patriarchs till the flood get out of the ark with noah and his sons make and support all the kings of the earth till the captivity of the israelites in egypt and then the poor fatherhood be under hatch till god by give the israelites kings reestablish the ancient and prime right of the lineal succession in paternal government this be his business from p to and then obviate au objection and clear a difficulty or two with onehalf reason p to confirm the natural right of regal power he end the first chapter i hope it be no injury to call an half quotation an half reason for god say honour thy father and mother but our author content himself with half leave out thy mother quite as little serviceable to his purpose but of that more in another place i do not think our author so little skilled in the way of write discourse of this nature nor so careless of the point in hand that he by oversight commit the fault that he himself in his anarchy of a mix monarchy p object to mr hunton in these word where first i charge the a that he hath not give us any definition or description of monarchy in general for by the rule of method he should have first define and by the like rule of method sir robert should have tell us what his fatherhood or fatherly authority be before he have tell us in whom it w as to be find and talk so much of it but perhaps sir robert find that this fatherly authority this power of father and of kings for he make them both the same p would make a very odd and frightful figure and very disagree with what either children imagine of their parent or subject of their kings if he should have give us the whole draught together in that gigantic form he have paint it in his own fancy and therefore like a wary physician when he would have his patient swallow some harsh or corrosive liquor he mingle it with a large quantity of that which may dilute it that the scatter part may go down with less feel and cause less aversion let us then endeavour to find what account he give us of this fatherly authority as it lie scatter in the several part of his write and first as it be vest in adam he say not only adam but the succeed patriarchs have by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children p this lordship which adam by command have over the wholes world and by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy be as large and ample as the absolute dominion of any monarch which hath be since the creation p dominion of life and death make war and conclude peace p adam and the patriarchs have absolute power of life and death p kings in the right of parent succeed to the exercise of supreme jurisdiction p as kingly power be by the law of god so it hath no inferior law to limit it adam be lord of all p the father of a family govern by no other law than by his own will p the superiority of princes be above laws p the unlimited jurisdiction of kings be so amply describe by samuel p kings be above the laws p and to this purpose see a great deal more which our a deliver in bodins word it be certain that all laws privilege and grant of princes have no force but during their life if they be not ratify by the express consent or by sufferance of the prince follow especially privilege o p the reason why laws have be also make by kings be this when kings be either busy with war or distract with public care so that every private man could not have access to their persons to learn their will and pleasure then be laws of necessity invent that so every particular subject might find his princes pleasure decipher unto him in the table of his laws p in a monarchy the lie must by necessity be above the laws p a perfect kingdom be that wherein the king rule all things accord to his own will p neither common nor statute laws be or can be any diminution of that general power which kings have over their peon pie by right of fatherhood p adam be the father king and lord over his family a son a subject and a servant or slave be one and the same thing at first the father have power to dispose or sell his children or servants whence we find that in the first reckon up of goods in scripture the manservant and the maidservant be number among the possessions and substance of the owner as other goods be o pref god also hath give to the father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other whence we find the sale and gift of children to have be much in use in the begin of the world when men have their servants for a possession and an inheritance as well as other goods whereupon we find the power of castrate and make eunuchs much in use in old time o p law be nothing else but the will of him that hath the power of the supreme father o p it be gods ordinance that the supremacy should be unlimited in adam and as large as all the act of his will and as in him so in all others that have supreme power o p i have be fain to trouble my reader with these several quotations in our as own word that in them might be see his own description of his fatherly authority as it lie scatter up and down in his write which he suppose be first vest in adam and by right belong to all princes ever since this fatherly authority there or right of fatherhood in our as sense be a divine unalterable right of sovereignty whereby a father or a prince hath an absolute arbitrary unlimited and unlimitable power over the live liberties and estates of his children and subject so that he may take or alienate their estates sell castrate or use their persons as he please they be all his slave and he lord or proprietor of every thing and his unbounded will their law our a have place such a mighty power in adam and upon that supposition found all government and all power of princes it be reasonable to expect that he should have prove this with arguments clear and evident suitable to the weightiness of the cause that since men have nothing else leave them they might in slavery have such undeniable proof of its necessity that their consciences might be convince and oblige them to submit peaceably to that absolute dominion which their governors have a right to exercise over them without this what good could our a do or pretend to do by erect such an unlimited power but flatter the natural vanity and ambition of men too apt of itself to grow and increase with the possession of any power and by persuade those who by the consent of their fellowmen be advance to great but limit degrees of it that by that part which be give them they have a right to all that be not so and therefore may do what they please because they have authority to do more than others and so tempt them to do what be neither for their own nor the good of those under their care whereby great mischief can not but follow the sovereignty of adam be that on which as a sure basis our a build his mighty absolute monarchy i expect that in his patriarcha this his main supposition would have be prove and establish with all that evidence of arguments that such a fundamental tenet require and that this which the great stress of the business depend would have be make out with reason sufficient to justify the confidence with which it be assume but in all that treatise i could find very little tend that way the thing be there so take for grant without proof that i could scarce believe myself when upon attentive read that treatise i find there so mighty a structure raise upon the bare supposition of this foundation for it be scarce credible that in a discourse where he pretend to confute the erroneous principle of man natural freedom he should do it by a bare supposition of adams authority without offer any proof for that authority indeed he confidently say that adam have royal authority p and absolute lordship and dominion of life and death p an universal monarchy p absolute power of life and death p he be very frequent in such assertions but what be strange in all his whole patriarcha i find not one presence of a reason to establish this his great foundation of government not any thing that look like an argument but these word to confirm this natural right of regal power we find in the decalogue that the law which enjoin obedience to kings be deliver ill the term honour thy father as if all power be originally in the father and why may i not add as well that in the decalogue the law that enjoin obedience to queen be deliver in the term of honour thy mother as if all power be originally in the mother the argument as sir robert put it will hold as well for one as the other but of this more in its due place all that i take notice of here be that this be all our a say in this first or any of the follow chapters to prove the absolute power of adam which be his great principle and yet as if he have there settle it upon sure demonstration he begin his second chapter with these word by confer these proof and reason draw from the authority of the scripture where those proof and reason for adams sovereignty be bat that of honour thy father abovementioned i confess i can not find unless what he say p in these word we have an evident confession viz of bellarmine that creation make man prince of his posterity must be take for proof and reason draw from scripture or for any sort of proof at all though from thence by a new way of inference in the word immediately follow he conclude the royal authority of adam sufficiently settle in him if he have in that chapter or any where in the whole treatise give any other proof of adams royal authority other than by often repeat it which among some men go for argument i desire any body for him to show me the place and page that i may be convince of my mistake and acknowledge my oversight if no such arguments be to be find i beseech those men who have so much cry up this book to consider whether they do not give the world cause to suspect that it be not the force of reason and argument that make them for absolute monarchy but some other by interest and therefore be resolve to applaud any author that write in favour of this doctrine whether he support it with reason or no but i hope they do not expect that rational and indifferent men should be bring over to their opinion because this their great doctor of it in a discourse make on purpose to set up the absolute monarchical power of adam in opposition to the natural freedom of mankind have say so little to prove it from whence it be rather naturally to be conclude that there be little to be say but that i might omit no care to inform myself in our author full sense i consult his observations on aristotle hobbes c to see whether in dispute with others he make use of any arguments for this his darling tenet of adams sovereignty since in his treatise of the natural power of kings he hath be so spar of them in his observations on mr hobbess leviathan i think he have put in short all those arguments for it together which in his write i find him any where to make use of his word be these if god create only adam and of a piece of him make the woman and if by generation from them two as part of them all mankind be propagate if also god give to adam not only the dominion over the woman and the children that should issue from them but also over all the earth to subdue it and over all the creatures on it so that as long as adam live no man could claim or enjoy any thing but by donation assignation or permission from him i wonder c obs here we have the sum of all his arguments for adams sovereignty and against natural freedom which i find up and down in his other treatises and they be these follow god s creation of adam the dominion he give him over eve an the dominion he have as father over his children all which i shall particularly consider of adams title to sovereignty by creation sir robert in his preface to his observations on aristotles politics tell us a natural freedom of mankind can not be suppose without the denial of the creation of adam but how adams be create which be nothing but his receive a be immediately from omnipotency and the hand of god give adam a sovereignty over any thing i can not see nor consequently understand how a supposition of natural freedom be a denial of adams creation and would be glad any body else since our a do not vouchsafe us the favour would make it out for him for i find no difficulty to suppose the freedom of mankind though i have always believe the creation of adam he be create or begin to exist by gods immediate power without the intervention of parent or the preexistence of any of the same species to beget him when it please god he should and so do the lion the king of beasts before him by the same create power of god and if bare existence by that power and in that way will give dominion without any more ado our a by this argument will make the hon have as good a title to it as he and certainly the ancienter no for adam have his title by the appointment of god say our a in another place then bare creation give him not dominion and one might have suppose mankind free without the deny the creation of adam since it be gods appointment make him monarch but let us see how he put his creation and this appointment together by the appointment of god say sir robert as soon as adam be create he be monarch of the world though he have no subject for though there could not be actual government till there be subject yet by the right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity though not in act yet at least in habit adam be a king from his creation i wish he have tell us here what he mean by gods appointment for whatsoever providence order or the law of nature direct or positive revelation declare may be say to be by god s appointment but i suppose it can not be mean here in the first sense ie by providence because that would be to say no more but that as soon as adam be create he be de facto monarch because by right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity but he could not de facto be by providence constitute the governor of the world at a time when there be actually no government no subject to be govern which our a here confess monarch of the world be also differently use by our a for sometimes he mean by it a proprietor of all the world exclusive of the rest of mankind and thus he do in the same page of his preface before cite adam say he be command to multiply and people the earth and subdue it and have dominion give him over all creatures be thereby the monarch of the whole world none of his posterity have any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him let us understand then by monarch proprietor of the world and by appointment gods actual donation and reveal positive grant make to adam gen i as we see sir robert himself do in this parallel place and then his argument will tend thus by the positive grant of god as soon as adam be create he be proprietor of the world because by the right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity in which way of argue there be two manifest falsehoods first it be false that god make that grant to adam as soon as he be create since though it stand in the text immediately after his creation yet it be plain it could not be speak to adam till after eve be make and bring to him and how then could he be monarch by appointment as soon as create especially since he call if i mistake not that which god say to eve gen iii the original grant of government which not be till after the fall when adam be somewhat at least in time and very much distant in condition from his creation i can not see how our a can say in this sense that by gods appointment as soon as adam be create he be monarch of the world secondly be it true that gods actual donation appoint adam monarch of the world as soon as he be create yet the reason here give for it would not prove it but it would always be a false inference that god by a positive donation appoint adam monarch of the world because by right of nature it be due to adam to be governor of his posterity for have give him the right of government by nature there be no need of a positive donation at least it will never be a proof of such a donation on the other side the matter will not be much mend if we understand by gods appointment the law of nature though it be a pretty harsh expression for it in this place and by monarch of the world sovereign ruler of mankind for then the sentence under consideration must run thus by the law of nature as soon as adam be create he be governor of mankind for by right of nature it divas due to adam to be governor of his posterity which amount to this he be governor by right of nature because he be governor by right of nature but suppose we should grant that a man be by nature governor of his children adam could not hereby be monarch as soon as create for this right of nature be found in his be their father how adam could have a natural right to be governor before he be a father men by be a father only he have that right be methinks hard to conceive unless he would have him to be a father before he be a father and have a title before he have it to this foresee objection our a answer very logically he be governor in habit and not in act a very pretty way of be a governor without government a father without children and a king without subject and thus sir robert be an author before he writ his book not in act it be true but in habit for when he have once publish it it be due to him by the right of nature to be an author as much as it be to adam to be governor of his children when he have beget them and if to be such a monarch of the world an absolute monarch in habit but not in act will serve the turn i should not much envy it to any of sir roberts friends that he think fit graciously to bestow it upon though even this of act and habit if it signify any thing but our as skill in distinctions be not to his purpose in this place for the question be not here about adams actual exercise of government but actually have a title to be governor government say our a be due to adam by the right of nature what be this right of nature a right father have over their children by beget them generatione jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos say our a out of grotius de j b p l c s the right then follow the beget as arise from it so that accord to this way of reason or distinguish of our a adam as soon as he be create have a title only in habit and not in act which in plain english be he have actually no title at all to speak less learnedly and more intelligibly one may say of adam he be in a possibility of be governor since it be possible he might beget children lay thereby acquire that right of nature be it what it will to govern them that accrue from thence but what connexion have this with adams creation to make him say that as soon as he be create he be monarch of the world for it may as well be say of noah that as soon as he be bear he be monarch of the world since he be in possibility which in our as sense be enough to make a monarch a monarch in habit to outlive all mankind but his own posterity what such necessary connexion there be betwixt adams creation and his right to government so that a natural freedom of mankind can not be suppose without the denial of the creation of adam i confess for my part i do not see nor how those word by the appointment c obs however explain can be put together to make any tolerable sense at least to establish this position with which they end viz adam be a king from his creation a king say our author not in act but in habit ie actually no king at all i fear i have tire my readers patience by dwell longer on this passage than the weightiness of any argument in it seem to require but i have unavoidably be engage in it by our author way of write who huddle several suppositions together and that in doubtful and general term make such a medley and confusion that it be impossible to show his mistake without examine the several sense wherein his word may be take and without see how in any of these various mean they will consist together and have any truth in then for in this present passage before us how can any one argue against this position of his that adam be a king from his creation unless one examine whether the word from his creation be to be take as they may for the time of the commencement of his government as the fore go word import as soon as he be create he be monarch or for the cause of it as he say p creation make man prince of his posterity how farther can one judge of the truth of his be thus king till one have examine whether king be to be take as the word in the begin of this passage would persuade on supposition of his private dominion which be lay gods positive grant monarch of the world by appointment or king on supposition of lie fatherly power over his offspring which be by nature due by the right of nature whether i say king be to be take in both or one only of these two sense or in neither of then but only this that creation make him prince in a way different from both the other for though this assertion that adam be king from his creation be true in no sense yet it stand here as an evident conclusion draw from the precede word though in truth it be but a bare assertion join to other assertions of the same kind which confidently put together in word of undetermined and dubious mean look like a sort of argue when there be indeed neither proof nor connexion a way very familiar with our author of which have give the reader a taste here i shall as much as the argument will permit me avoid touch on hereafter and should not have do it here be it not to let the world see how incoherences in matter and suppositions without proof put handsomely together in good word and a plausible style be apt to pass for strong reason and good sense till they come to be look into with attention of adams title to sovereignty by donation gen i have at last get through the forego passage where we have be so long detain not by the force of arguments and opposition but by the intricacy of the word and the doubtfulness of the mean let us go on to his next argument for adams sovereignty our author tell us in the word of mr selden that adam by donation from god gen i be make the general lord of all things not without such a private dominion to himself as without his grant do exclude his children this determination of mr selden say our author be consonant to the history of the bible and natural reason obs and in his pref to his observations on aristotle he say thus the first government in the world be monarchical in the father of all flesh adam be command to multiply and people the earth and to subdue it and have dominion give him over all creatures be thereby the monarch of the whole world none of his posterity have any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him the earth saith the psalmist hath he give to the children of men which show the title come from fatherhood before i examine this argument and the text on which it be found it be necessary to desire the reader to observe that our author accord to his usual method begin in one sense and conclude in another he begin here with adams propriety or private dominion by donation and his conclusion be which show the title come from fatherhood but let us see the argument the word of the text be these and god bless them and god say unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every live thing that moveth upon the earth gen i from whence our author conclude that adam have here dominion give him over all creatures be thereby the monarch of the whole world whereby must be mean that either this grant of god give adam property or as our author call it private dominion over the earth and all inferior or irrational creatures and so consequently that he be thereby monarch or dly that it give him rule and dominion over all earthly creatures whatsoever and thereby over his children and so he be monarch for as mr selden have properly word it adam be make general lord of all things one may very clearly understand him that he mean nothing to be grant to adam here but property and therefore he say not one word of adams monarchy but our author say adam be hereby monarch of the world which properly speak signify sovereign ruler of all the men in the world and so adam by this grant must be constitute such a ruler if our author mean otherwise he might with much clearness have say that adam be hereby proprietor of the whole world but he beg your pardon in that point clear distinct speak not serve every where to his purpose you must not expect it in him as in mr selden or other such writers in opposition therefore to our author doctrine that adam be monarch of the whole world found on this place i shall show that by this grant gen i god give no immediate power to adam over men over his children over those of his own species and so he be not make ruler or monarch by this charter that by this grant god give him not private dominion over the inferior creatures but right in common with all mankind so neither be he monarch upon the account of the property here give him that this donation gen i give adam no power over men will appear if we consider the word of it for since all positive grant convey no more than the express word they be make in will carry let us see which of them here will comprehend mankind or adams posterity and those i imagine if any must be these every live thing that moveth the word in hebrew be h ie bestiam reptantem of which word the scripture itself be the best interpreter god have create the fish and fowl the th day the begin of the th he create the irrational inhabitants of the dry land which ver be describe in these word let the earth bring forth the live creature after his kind cattle and creep thin and beasts of the earth after his kind and ver and god make the beasts of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth on the earth after his kind here in the creation of the brute inhabitants of the earth he first speak of them all under one general name of live creatures and then afterwards divide them into three rank cattle or such creatures as be or might be tame and so be the private possession of particular men g which ver in our bible be translate beasts and by the septuagint qhr a wild beasts and be the same word that here in our text ver where we have this great charter to adam be translate live thing and be also the same word use gen ix where this grant be renew to noah and there likewise translate beast the third rank be the creep animals which ver be comprise under the word the same that be use here ver and be translate move but in the former verse creep and by the septuagint in all these place pet or reptiles from whence it appear that the word which we translate here in gods donation ver live creatures move be the same which in the history of the creation ver signify two rank of terrestrial creatures viz wild beasts and reptiles and be so understand by the septuagint when god have make the irrational animals of the world divide into three kinds from the place of their habitation viz fish of the sea fowl of the air and live creatures of the earth and these again into cattle wild beasts and reptiles he consider of make man and the dominion he should have over the terrestrial world ver and then he reckon up the inhabitants of these three kingdoms but in the terrestrial leave out the second rank h or wild beasts but here ver where he actually exercise this design and give him this dominion the text mention the fish of the sea and fowl of the air and the terrestrial creatures in the word that signify the wild beasts and reptiles though translate live thing that moveth leave out cattle in both which place though the word that signify wild beasts be omit in one and that which signify cattle in the other yet since god certainly execute in one lilacs what he declare he design in the other we can not but understand the same in both place and have here only an account how the terrestrial irrational animals which be already create and reckon up at their creation in three distinct rank of cattle wild beasts and reptiles be here ver actually put under the dominion of man as they be design ver nor do these word contain in them the least appearance of any thing that can be wrest to signify gods give to one man dominion over another to adam over his posterity and this further appear front gen ix where god renew this charter to noah and his sons he give them dominion over the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and the terrestrial creatures express by h wild beasts and reptiles the same word that in the text before us gen i be translate every move thing that moveth on the earth which by no mean can comprehend man the grant be make to noah and his sons all the men then live and not to one part of men over another which be yet more evident from the very next word ver where god give every every move thing the very word use ch i to them for food by all which it be plain that gods donation to adam ch i and his designation ver and his grant again to noah and his sons refer to and contain in them neither more nor less than the work of the creation the fifth day and the begin of the sixth as they be set down from the both to th ver inclusively of the st ch and so comprehend all the species of irrational animals of the terraqueous globe though all the word whereby they be express in the history of their creation be nowhere use in any of the follow grant but some of them omit in one and some in another from whence i think it be past all doubt that man can not be comprehend in this grant nor any dominion over those of his own species be convey to adam all the terrestrial irrational creatures be enumerate at their creation ver under the name beasts of the earth cattle and creep things but man be not then create be not contain under any of those name and therefore whether we understand the hebrew word right or no they can not be suppose to comprehend man in the very same history and the very next verse follow especially since that hebrew word which if any in this donation to adam ch i must comprehend man be so plainly use in contradistinction to him as gen vi vii gen viii and if god make all mankind slave to adam and his heirs by give adam dominion over every live thing that moveth on the earth ch i as our author would have it methinks sir robert should leave carry his monarchical power one step higher and satisfy the world that princes might eat their subject too since god give as full power to noah and his heirs ch ix to eat every live thing that moveth as he do to adam to have dominion over them the hebrew word in both place be the same david who might be suppose to understand the donation of god in this text and the right of kings too as well as our author in his comment on this place as the learn and judicious ainsworth call it in the th psalm find here no such charter of monarchical power his word be thou hast make him ie man the son of man a little lower than the angels thou madest him to have dominion over the work of thy hand thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen and the beasts of the field and fowl of the air and fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea in which word if any one can find out that there be mean any monarchical power of one man over another but only the dominion of the whole species of mankind over the inferior species of creatures he may for aught i know deserve to be one of sir roberts monarchs in habit for the rareness of the discovery and by this time i hope it be evident that he that give dominion over every hying thing that moveth on the earth give adam no monarchical power over those of his own species which will yet appear more fully in the next thing i be to show whatever god give by the word of this grant gen i it be not to adam in particular exclusive of all other men whatever dominion he have thereby it be not a private dominion but a dominion in common with the rest of mankind that this donation be not make in particular to adam appear evidently from the word of the text it be make to more than one for it be speak in the plural number god bless them and say unto them have dominion god say unto adam and eve have dominion thereby say our author adam be monarch of the world but the grant be to them ie speak to eve also as many interpreters think with reason that these word be not speak till adam have his wife must not she thereby be lady as well as he lord of the world if it be say that eve be subject to adam it seem she be not so subject to him as to hinder her dominion over the creatures or property in them for shall we say that god ever make a joint grant to two and one only be to have the benefit of it but perhaps it will be say eve be not make till afterward grant it so what advantage will our author get by it the text will be only the more directly against him and show that god in this donation give the world to mankind in common and not to adam in particular the word them in the text must include the species of man for it be certain them can by no mean signify adam alone in the th verse where god declare his intention to give this dominion it be plain he mean that he would make a species of creatures that should have dominion over the other species of this terrestrial globe the word be and god say let us make man in our image after our liken and let them have dominion over the fish c they then be to have dominion who even those who be to have the image of god the individuals of that species of man that he be go to make for that them should signify adam singly of the rest that should be in the world with him be against both scripture and all reason and it can not possibly be make sense if man in the former part of the verse do not signify the same with them in the latter only man there as be usual be take for the species and them the individuals of that species and we leave a reason in the very text god make him in his own image after his own liken make him an intellectual creature and so capable of dominion for wherein soever else the image of god consist the intellectual nature be certainly a part of it and belong to the whole species and enable them to have dominion over the inferior creatures and therefore david say in the th psalm above cite thou hast make him little longer than the angels thou hast make him to have dominion it be not of adam king david speak here for verse it be plain it be of man and the son of man of the species of mankind and that this grant speak to adam be make to him and the whole species of man be clear from our author own proof out of the psalmist the earth saith the psalmist hath he give to the children of men which show the title come from fatherhood these be sir roberts word in the preface before cite and a strange inference it be he make god hath give the earth to the children of men ergo the title come from fatherhood it be pity the propriety of the hebrew tongue have not use father of men instead of children of men to express mankind then indeed our author might have have the countenance of talc socials of the word to have place the title in the fatherhood but to conclude that the fatherhood lead the right to the earth because god give it to the children of men be a way of argue peculiar to our author and a man must have a great mind to go contrary to the sound as well as sense of the word before he could light on it but the sense be yet harder and more remote from our author purpose for as it stand in his preface it be to prove adams be monarch and his reason be thus god give the partly to the children of men ergo adam be monarch of the world i defy any man try make a more pleasant conclusion than this which can not be excuse from the most obvious absurdity till it can be show that by children of men he who have no father adam alone be signify but whatever our author do the scripture speak not nonsense to maintain this property and private dominion of adam our author labour in the follow page to destroy the community grant to noah and his sons in that parallel place gen ix and he endeavour to do it two ways sir robert would persuade us against the express word of the scripture that what be here grant to noah be not grant to his sons in common with him his word be as for the general community between noah and his sons which mr selden will have to be grant to them gen ix the text cloth not warrant it what warrant our author would have when the plain express word of scripture not capable of another mean will not satisfy him who pretend to build wholly on scripture be not easy to imagine the text say god bless noah and his sons and say unto them ie as our author would have it unto him for saith he although the sons be there unmentioned with noah in the bless yet it may best be understand with a subordination or benediction m succession o that indeed be best for our author to be understand which best serve to his purpose but that truly may best be understand by any body else which best agree with the plain construction of the word and arise from the obvious mean of the place and then with subordination and in succession will not be lest understand in a grant of god where he himself put them not nor mention any such limitation but yet our author have reason why it may best he understand so the bless say he in the follow word might truly be fulfil if the sons either under or after their father enjoy a private dominion o that be to say that a grant whose express word give a joint title in present for the text say into your hand they be deliver may best be understand with a subordination or in succession because it be possible that in subordination in succession it may be enjoy which be all one as to say that a grant of any thing in present possession may best be understand of reversion because it be possible one may live to enjoy it in reversion if the grant be indeed to a father and to his sons after him who be so kind as to let his children enjoy it presently in common with him one may truly say as to the event one will be as good as the other but it can never be true that what the express word grant in possession and in common may best be understand to be in reversion the sum of all his reason amount to this god do not give to the sons of noah the world in common with their father because it be possible they might enjoy it under or after him a very good sort of argument against an express text of scripture but god must not be believe though he speak it himself when he say he do any thing which will not consist with sir roberts hypothesis for it be plain however he would exclude them that part of this benediction as he would have it in succession must need be mean to the sons and not to noah himself at all be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth say god in this bless this part of the benedic tion as appear by the sequel concern not noah himself at all for we read not of any children he have after the flood and in the follow chapter where his posterity be reckon up there be no mention of any and so this benediction in succession be not to take place till years after and to save our author imaginary monarchy the people of the world must be defer years for this part of the benediction can not be understand with subordination unless our author will say that they must ask leave of their father noah to lie with their wive but in this one point our author be constant to himself in all his discourse he take care there should be monarchs in the world but very little that there should be people and indeed his way of government be not the way to people the world for how much absolute monarchy help to fulfil this great and primary bless of god almighty be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth which contain in it the improvement too of arts and sciences and the conveniencies of life may be see in those large and rich countries which be happy under the turkish government where be not now to be find onethird nay in many if not most part of them onethirtieth perhaps i might say not onehundredth of the people that be formerly as will easily appear to any one who will compare the account we have of it at this time with ancient history but this by the by the other part of this benediction or grant be so express that they must need be understand to belong equally to them all as much to noahs sons as to noah himself and not to his sons with a subordination or in succession the fear of you and the dread of you say god shall be upon every beast c will any body but our author say that the creatures fear and stand in awe of noah only and not of his sons without his leave or till after his death and the follow word into your hand they be deliver be they to be understand as our author say if your father please or they shall be deliver into your hand hereafter if this be to argue from scripture i know not what may not be prove by it and i can scarce see how much this dither from that fiction and fancy or how much a surer foundation it will prove than the opinions of philosophers and poets which our author so much condemn in his preface but our author go on to prove that it may best be understand with a subordination or a benediction in succession for say he it be not probable that the private dominion which god give to adam and by his donation assignation or cession to his children be abro gate and a community of all things institute between noah and his sonsnoah be leave the sole heir of the world why should it be think that god would disinherit him of his birth right and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children o the prejudice of our own illgrounded opinions however by us call probable can not authorize us to understand scripture contrary to the direct and plain mean of the word i grant it be not probable that adams private dominion be here abrogate because it be more than improbable for it will never be prove that adam have any such private dominion and since parallel place of scripture be most probable to make us know how they may be best understand there need but the compare this bless here to noah and his sons after the flood with that to adam after the creation gen i to assure any one that god give adam no such private dominion it be probable i confess that noah should have the same title the same property and dominion after the flood that adam have before it but since private dominion can not consist with the bless and grant god give to him and his sons in common it be a sufficient reason to conclude that adam have none especially since in the donation make to him there be no word that express it or do in the least favour it and then let my reader judge whether it may best be understand when in the one place there be not one word for it not to say what have be above prove that the test itself prove the contrary and in the other the word and sense be directly against it but our author say noah be the sole heir of the world why should it be think that god would disinherit him of his birth right heir indeed in england signify the eldest son who be by the law of england to have all his father land but where god ever appoint any such heir of the world our author would have do well to have show us and how god disinherit him of his birth right or what harm be do him if god give his sons a right to make use of a part of the earth for support of themselves and families when the whole be not only more than noah himself but infinitely more than they all could make use of and the possessions of one could not at all prejudice or as to any use straiten that of the other our author probably foresee he might not be very successful in persuade people out of their sense and say what he could men would be apt to believe the plain word of scripture and think as they say that the grant be speak to noah and his sons jointly he endeavour to insinuate as if this grant to noah convey no property no dominion because subdue the earth and dominion over the creatures be therein omit nor the earth once name and therefore say he there be a considerable difference between these two texts the first bless give adam a dominion over the earth and all creatures the latter allow noah liberty to use the live creatures for food here be no alteration or diminish of his title to a property of all things but an enlargement only of his commons o so that in our author sense all that be say here to noah and his sons give them no dominion no property but only enlarge the commons their commons i should say since god say to you be they give though our author say his for as to noahs sons they it seem by sir roberts appointment during their father lifetime be to keep fastingdays any one but our author would be mightily suspect to be blind with prejudice that in all this bless to noah and his sons could see nothing but only an enlargement of commons for as to dominion which our author think omit the fear of you and the dread of you say god shall be upon every beast which i suppose express the dominion or superiority be design man over the live creatures as fully as may be for in that fear and dread seem chiefly to consist what be give to adam over the inferior animals who as absolute a monarch as he be could not make bold with a lark or rabbit to satisfy his hunger and have the herbs but in common with the beset as be plain from gen i and in the next place it be manifest that in this bless to noah and his sons property be not only give in clear word but in a larger extent than it be to adam into your hand they be give say god to noah and his sons which word if they give not property nay property in possession it will be hard to find word that can since there be not a way to express a man be possess of any thing more natural nor more certain than to say it be deliver into his hand and ver to show that they have then give them the utmost property man be capable of which be to have a right to destroy any thing by use it every move thing that liveth saith god shall be meat for you which be not allow to adam in his charter this our author call a liberty of use them for food and also an enlargement of commons but no alteration of property o what other property man can have in the creatures but the liberty of use them be hard to be understand so that if the first bless as our author say give adam dominion over the creatures and the bless to noah and his sons give them such a liberty to use them as adam have not it must need give them something that adam with all his sovereignty want something that one would be apt to take for a greater property for certainly he have no absolute dominion over even the brutal part of the creatures and the property he have in them be very narrow and scanty who can not make that use of them which be permit to another should any one who be absolute lord of a country have bid our author subdue the earth and give him dominion over the creatures in it but not have permit him to have take a kid or a lamb out of the flock to satisfy his hunger i guess he would scarce leave think himself lord or proprietor of that land or the cattle on it but would have find the difference between have dominion which a shepherd may have and have full property as an owner so that have it be his own case sir robert i believe would have think here be an alteration nay an enlarge of property and that noah and his children have by this grant not only property give them but such a property give them in the creatures as adam have not for however in respect of one another slice may lo allow to have propriety in their distinct portion of the creatures yet in respect of god the maker of heaven and earth who be sole lord and proprietor of the whole world man propriety in the creatures be nothing but that liberty to use them which god have permit and so man property may be alter and enlarge as we see it here after the flood when other use of them be allow which before be not from all which i suppose it be clear that neither adam nor noah have any private dominion any property in the creatures exclusive of his posterity as they should successively grow up into need of them and come to be able to make use of them thus we have examine our author argument for adams monarchy found on the bless pronounce gen i wherein i think it be impossible for any sober reader to find any other but the set of mankind above the other kinds of creatures in this habitable earth of ours it be nothing but the give to man the whole species of man as the chief inhabitant who be the image of his maker the dominion over the other creatures this lie so obvious in the plain word that any one but our author would have think it necessary to have show how these word that seem to say the quite contrary give adam monarchical absolute power over other men or the sole property in all the creatures and methinks in a business of this moment and that whereon he build all that follow he should have do something more than barely cite word which apparently make against him for i confess i can not see any thing in them tend to adams monarchy or private dominion but quite the contrary and i the less deplore the dulness of my apprehension herein since i find the apostle seem to have as little notion of any such private dominion of adam as i when he say god give us all things richly to enjoy which he could not do if it be all give away already to monarch adam and the monarchs his heirs and successors to conclude this text be so far from prove adam sole proprietor that on the contrary it be a confirmation of the original community of all things amongst the sons of men which appear from this donation of god as well as other place of scripture the sovereignty of adam build upon his private dominion must fall not hay any foundation to support it but yet if after all any one will need have it so that by this donation of god adam be make sole proprietor of the whole earth what will this be to his sovereignty and how will it appear that propriety in land give a man power over the life of another or how will the possession even of the whole earth give any one a sovereign arbitrary authority over the persons of men the most specious thing to be say be that he that be proprietor of the whole world may deny all the rest of mankind food and so at his pleasure starve them if they will not acknowledge his sovereignty and obey his will if this be true it would be a good argument to prove that there never be any such property that god never give any such private dominion since it be more reasonable to think that god who bid mankind increase and multiply should rather himself give them all a right to make use of the food and raiment and other conveniencies of life the materials whereof he have so plentifully provide for them than to make them depend upon the will of a man for their subsistence who should have power to destroy them all when he please and who be no better than other men be in succession likelier by want and the dependence of a scanty fortune to tie them to hard service than by liberal allowance of the conveniencies of life to promote the great design of god increase and multiply he that doubt this let him look into the absolute monarchies of the world and see what become of the conveniencies of life and the multitudes of people but we know god hath not leave one man so to the mercy of another that he may starve him if he please god the lord and father of all have give no one of his children such a property in his peculiar portion of the things of this world but that he have give his needy brother a right to the surplusage of his goods so that it can not justly be deny him when his press want call for it and therefore no man could ever have a just power over the life of another by right of property in land or possessions since it would always be a sin in any man of estate to let his brother perish for want of afford him relief out of his plenty as justice give every man a title to the product of his honest industry and the fair acquisitions of his ancestors descend to him so charity give every man a title to so much out of anothers plenty as will keep him from extreme want where he have no mean to subsist otherwise and a man can no mare justly make use of anothers necessity to force him to become his vassal by withhold that relief god require him to afford to the want of his brother than he that have more strength can seize upon a weaker master him to his obedience and with a dagger at his throat offer him death or slavery should any one make so perverse an use of gods bless pour on him with a liberal hand should any one be cruel and uncharitable to that extremity yet all this would not prove that propriety ill land even in this case give any authority over the persons of men but only that compact might since the authority of the rich proprietor and the subjections of the needy beggar begin not from the possession of the lord but the consent of the poor man who prefer be his subject to starve and the man he thus submit to can pretend to no more power over him than he have consent to upon compact upon this grind a man have his store fill in a time of scarcity have money in his pocket be in a vessel at sea be able to swim c may as well be the foundation of rule and dominion as be possessor of all the land in the world any of these be sufficient to enable me to save a man life who would perish if such assistance be deny him and any thing by this rule that may be an occasion of work upon anothers necessity to sale his life or any thing dear to him at the of his freedom may be make a foundation of sovereignty as well as property from all which it be clear that though god should have give adam private dominion yet that private dominion could give him no sovereignty but we have already sufficiently prove that god give him no private dominion of adams title to sovereignty by the subjection of eve the next place of scripture we find our author build his monarchy of adam on be gen iii and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee here we have say he the original grant of government from whence he conclude in the follow part of the page o that the supreme power be settle in the fatherhood and limit to one kind of government that be to monarchy for let his premise be what they will this be always the conclusion let rule in any text be but once name and presently absolute monarchy be by divine right establish if any one will but carefully read our author own reason from these word o and consider among other things the line and posterity of adam as he there bring them in he will find some difficulty to make sense of what he say but we will allow this at present to his peculiar way of write and consider the force of the text in hand the word be the curse of god upon the woman for have be the first and forwardest in the disobedience and if we will consider the occasion of what god say here to our first parent that he be denounce judgment and declare his wrath against them both for their disobedience we can not suppose that this be the time wherein god be grant adam prerogatives and privilege invest him with dignity and authority elevate him to dominion and monarchy for though as a holster in the temptation live be lay below him and so he have accidentally a superiority over her for her greater punishment yet he too have his share in the fall as well as the sin and be lay lower as may be see in the follow verse and it would be hard to imagine that gall in the same breath should make him universal monarch over all mankind and a daylabourer for his life turn lie out of paradise to till the grind ver and at the same time advance him to a throne and all the privilege and case of absolute power this be not a time when adam could expect any favour any grant of privilege from his offend maker if this be the original grant of government as our author tell us and adam be now make monarch whatever sir robert would have him it be plain god make him but a very poor monarch such an one as our author himself would have count it no great privilege to be god set him to work for his live and seem rather to give him a spade into his hand to subdue the earth than a sceptre to rule over its inhabitants in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread say god to him ver this be unavoidable may it perhaps be answer because he be yet without subject and have nobody to work for him but afterwards live as he do above years he might have people enough whom he might command to work for him no say god not only whilst thou art without other help save thy wife but as long as thou livest shalt thou live by thy labour in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread till thou return unto the grind for out of it west thou take for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return ver it will perhaps be answer again in favour of our author that these word be not speak personally to adam but in him as their representative to all mankind this be a curse upon mankind because of the fall god i believe speak differently from men because he speak with more truth more certainty but when he vouchsafe to speak to men l do not think he speak differently from them in cross the rule of language in use amongst them this would not be to condescend to their capacities when he humble himself to speak to them but to lose his design in speak what thus speak they could not understand and fact thus must we think of god if the interpretations of scripture necessary to maintain our author doctrine must be receive for good for by the ordinary rule of language it will be very hard to understand what god say if what he speckle here in the singular number to adam must be understand to be speak to all mankind and what he say in the plural number gen i and must be understand of adam alone exclusive of all others and what he say to noah and his sons jointly must be understand to be mean to noah alone gen ix farther it be to be note that these word here of gen iii which our author call the original grant of government be not speak to adam neither indeed be there any grant in them snide to adam but a punishment lay upon eve and if we will take them as they be direct in particular to her or in her as their representative to all other women they will at most concern the female sex only and im port no more but that subjection they should ordinarily be in to their husband but there be here no more law to oblige a woman to such subjection if the circumstances either of her condition or contract with her husband should exempt her from it than there be that she should bring forth her children in sorrow and pain if there could be find a remedy for itwhich be also a part of the same curse upon her for the whole verse run thus unto the woman he say i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee it would i think have be a hard matter for any body but our author to have find out a grant of monarchical government to adam in these word which be neither speak to nor of him neither will any one i suppose by these word think the weaker sex as by a law so subject to the curse contain in them that it be their duty not to endeavour to avoid it find will any one say that eve or any other woman sin if she be bring to bed without those multiply pain god threaten her here with or that either of our queen mary or elizabeth have they marry any of their subject have be by this text put into a political subjection to him or that he should thereby have have monarchical rule over her god in this text give note that i see any authority to adam over eve or to men over their wive but only foretell what should be the womans lot how by his providence he would order it so that she should be subject to her husband as we see that generally the laws of mankind and customs of nations leave order it so and there be i grant a foundation in nature for it thus when god say of jacob and esau that the elder should serve the younger gen xxv nobody suppose that god hereby make jacob esaus sovereign but foretell what should de facto come to pass but if these word here speak to eve must need be understand as a law to bind her and all other women to subjection it can be no other subjection than what every wife owe her husband and then if this be the original grant of government and the foundation of monarchical power there will be as many monarchs as there be husband if therefore these word give any power to adam it can be only a conjugal power not political the power that every husband hath to order the things of private concernment in his family as proprietor of the goods and land there and to have his will take place before that of his wife in all things of their common concernment but not a political power of life and death over her much less over any body else this i be sure if our author will have this text to be a grant the original grant of government political government he ought to have prove it by some better arguments than by barely say that thy desire shall be unto thy husband be a law whereby eve and all that should come of her be subject to the absolute monarchical power of adam and his heirs thy desire shall be to thy husband be too doubtful an expression of whose signification interpreters be not agree to build so confidently on and in a matter of such moment and so great and general concernment but our author accord to his way of write have once name the text conclude presently without any more ado that the mean be as he would have it let the word rule and subject be but find in the text or margin and it immediately signify the duty of a subject to his prince the relation be change and though god say husband sir robert will have it king adam have presently absolute monarchical power over eve and not only over love but all that should come of her though the scripture say not a word of it nor our author a word to prove it but adam must for all that be an absolute monarch and so down to the end of the chapter and here i leave my reader to consider whether my bare say without offer any reason to evince it that this text give not adam that absolute monarchical power our author suppose be not as sufficient to destroy that power as his bare assertion be to establish it since the text mention neither prince nor people speckle nothing of absolute or monarchical power but the subjection of eve to adam a wife to her husband and he that would trace our author so all through would make a short and sufficient answer to the greatest part of the ground he proceed on and abundantly confute them by barely deny it be a sufficient answer to assertions without proof to deny them without give a reason and therefore should i have say nothing but barely deny that by this text the supreme power be settle and found by god himself in the fatherhood limit to monarchy and that to adams person and heirs all which our author notably conclude from these word as may be see in the same page o it have be a sufficient answer should i have desire any sober man only to have read the text and consider to whom and on what occasion it be speak he would no doubt have wonder how our author find out monarchical absolute power in it have he not have an exceed good faculty to find it himself where he could not show it others and thus we have examine the two place of scripture all that i remember our author bring to prove adams sovereignty that supremacy which he say it be gods ordinance should be unlimited in adam and as large as all the act of his will o viz gen i and gen iii one whereof signify only the subjection of the inferior rank of creatures to mankind and the other the subjection that be due from a wife to her husband both far enough from that which subject owe the governors of political societies i of adams title to sovereignty by fatherhood there be one thing more and then i think i have give you all that our author bring for proof of adams sovereignty and that be a supposition of a natural right of dominion over his children by be their father and this title of fatherhood he be so please with that you will find it bring in almost in every page particularly he say not only adam but the succeed patriarchs have by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children p and in the same page this subjection of children be the fountain of all regal authority c this be as one would think by his so frequent mention it the main basis of all his frame we may well expect clear and evident reason for it since he lay it down as a position necessary to his purpose that every man that be bear be so far from be free that by his very birth he become a subject of him that beget him o so that adam be the only man create and all ever since be beget nobody have be bear free if we ask how adam come by this power over his children he tell us here it be lay beget them and so again o this natural dominion of adam say he may be prove out of grotius himself who teacheth that generations jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos and indeed the act of beget be that which make a man a father his right of a father over his children can naturally arise from nothing else grotius tell us lot here how far this jus in liberos this power of parent over their children extend but our author always very clear in the point assure us it be supreme power and like that of absolute monarchs over their slave absolute power of life and death he that should demand of him how or for what reason it be that beget a child give the father such an absolute power over him will find him answer nothing we be to take his word for this as well as several other things and by that the laws of nature and the constitutions of government must stand or fall have he be an absolute monarch this way of talk might have suit well enough pro ratione voluntas might have be of force in his mouth but in the way of proof or argument be very unbecoming and will little advantage his plea for absolute monarchy sir robert have too much lessen a subject authority to leave himself the hop of establish any thing by his bare say it one slave opinion without proof be not of weight enough to dispose of the liberty and fortunes of all mankind if all men be not as i think they be naturally equal i be sure all slave be and then i may without presumption oppose my single opinion to his and be confident that my say that beget of children make them not slave to their father as certainly set all mankind free as his affirm the contrary make them all slave but that this position which be the foundation of all their doctrine who would have monarchy to be jure divino may have all fair play let us hear what reason others give for it since our author offer none the argument i leave hear others make use of to prove that father by beget them come by an absolute power over their children be this that father have a power over the live of their children because they give them life and be which be the only proof it be capable of since there can be no reason why naturally one man should have any claim or presence of right over that in another which be never his which he bestow not but be receive from the bounty of another i answer that every one who give another any thing have not always thereby a right to take it away again but they who say the father give life to children be so dazzle with the thoughts of monarchy that they do not as they ought remember god who be the author and giver of life it be in him alone we live move and have our be how can he be think to give life to another that know not wherein his own life consist philosophers be at a loss about it after their most diligent inquiries and anatomists after their whole live and study spend in dissections and diligent examine the body of men confess their ignorance in the structure and use of many part of man body and in that operation wherein life consist in the whole and doth the rude ploughman or the more ignorant voluptuary frame or fashion such an admirable engine as this be and then put life and sense into it can any man say he form the part that be necessary to the life of his child or can he suppose himself to give the life and yet not know what subject be fit to receive it nor what action or organs be necessary for its reception or preservation to give life to that which have yet no be be to frame and make a live creature fashion the part and mould and suit them to their use and have proportion and fit them together to put into them a hying soul he that could do this might indeed have some presence to destroy his own workmanship but be there any one so bold that dare thus far arrogate to himself the incomprehensible work of the almighty who alone do at first and continue still to make a live soul he alone can breathe in the greatly of life if any one think himself an artist at this let lie number up the part of his childs body will he hath make tell me their use and operations and when the live and rational soul begin to inhabit this curious structure when sense begin and how this engine which he have frame think and reason if he make it let him when it be out of order mend it at least tell wherein the defect lie shall he that make the eye not see say the psalmist psalm xciv see these mens vanities the structure of that one part be sufficient to convince us of an allwise contriver and he have so visible a claim to us as his workmanship that one of the ordinary appellations of god in scripture be god our maker and the lord our maker and therefore though our author for the magnify his fatherhood be please to say o that even the power which god himself exerciseth over mankind be by right of fatherhood yet this fatherhood be such an one as utterly exclude all presence of title in earthly parent for he be king because he be indeed maker of us all which no parent can pretend to be of their children but have men skill and power to make their children it be not so slight a piece of workmanship that it can be imagine they could make them without design it what father of a thousand when he beget a child think farther than the satisfy his prey send appetite god in his infinite wisdom have put strong desire of copulation into the constitution of men thereby to continue the race of mankind which he doth most commonly without the intention and often against the consent and will of the begetter and indeed those who desire and design children be but the occasion of their be and when they design and wish to beget them do little more towards their make than deucalion and his wife in the fable do towards the make of mankind by throw pebbles over their head but grant that the parent make their children give them life and be and that hence there follow an absolute power this would give the father but a joint dominion with the mother over them for nobody can deny but that the woman lath an equal share if not the greater as nourish the child a long time in her own body out of her own substance there it be fashion and from her it receive the materials and principles of its constitution and it be so hard to imagine the rational soul should presently inhabit the yet unformed embryo as soon as the father have do his part in the act of generation that if it must be suppose to derive any thing from the parent it must certainly owe most to the mother but be that as it will the mother can not be deny an equal share in beget of the child nod so the absolute authority of the father will not arise from hence our author indeed be of another mind for he say we know that god at the creation give the sovereignty to the man over the woman as be the nobler and principal agent in generation o i remember not this in my bible and when the place be bring where god at the creation give the sovereignty to man over the woman and that for this reason because he be the nobler and principal agent in generation it will be time enough to consider and answer it but it be no new thing for our author to tell us his own fancy for certain and divine truths though there be often a great deal of difference between his and divine revelations for god in the scripture say his father and his mother that beget him they who allege the practice of mankind for expose or sell their children as a proof of their power over them be with sir robert happy arguers and can not but recommend their opinion by found it on the most shameful action and most unnatural murder human nature be capable of the dens of lions and nurseries of wolves know no such cruelty as this these savage inhabitants of the desert obey god and nature in be tender and careful of their offspring they will hunt watch fight and almost starve for the preservation of their young never part with them never forsake them till they be able to shift for themselves and be it the privilege of man alone to act more contrary to nature than the wild and most untamed part of the creation doth god forbid us under the severest penalty that of death to take away the life of any man a stranger and upon provocation and do he permit us to destroy those he have give us the charge and care of and by the dictate of nature and reason as well as his reveal command require us to preserve he have in all the part of creation take a peculiar care to propagate and continue the several species of creatures anal make the individuals act so strongly to this end that they sometimes neglect their own private good for it and seem to forget that general rule which nature teach all things of selfpreservation and the preservation of their young as the strongest principle in them overrule the constitution of their particular natures thus we see when their young stand in need of it the timorous become valiant the fierce and savage kind and the ravenous tender and liberal but if the example of what hath be do be the rule of what ought to be history would have furnish our author with instance of this absolute fatherly power in its height and perfection and he might have show us in peru people that beget children on purpose to fatten and eat them the story be so remarkable that i can not but set it down in the author word in some provinces say he they be so liquorish after man flesh that they would not have the patience to stay till the breath be out of the body but would suck the blood as it run from the wound of the die man they have public shamble of man flesh and their madness herein be to that degree that they spar not their own children which they have beget on strangers take in war for they make their captives their mistresses and choicely nourish the children they lead by them till about thirteen years old they butcher and eat them and they serve the mother after the same fashion when they grow past childbearing and cease to bring them any more roasters garcilasso de la vega hist des yncas de peru i c thus far can the busy mind of man carry him to a brutality below the level of beasts when he quit his reason which place him almost equal to angels nor can it be otherwise in a creature whose thoughts be more than the sand and wider than the ocean where fancy and passion must need run him into strange course if reason which be his only star and compass be not that he steer by the imagination be always restless and suggest variety of thoughts and the will reason be lay afield be ready for every extravagant project and in this state he that go farthest out of the way be think fittest to lead and be sure of most followers and when fashion hath once establish what folly or craft begin custom make it sacred and it will be think impudence or madness to contradict or question it he that will impartially survey the nations of the world will find so much of their religions governments and manners bring in and continue amongst them by these mean that he will have but little reverence for the practice which be in use and credit amongst men and will have reason to think that the woods and forest where the irrational unteach inhabitants keep right by follow nature be fitter to give us rule than cities and palaces where those that call themselves civil and rational go out of their way by the authority of example if precedents be sufficient to establish a rule in this case our author might have find in holy writ children sacrifice by their parent and this amongst the people of god themselves the psalmist tell us psalm cvi they shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrifice unto the idols of canaan but god judge not of this by our author rule nor allow of the authority of practice against his righteous law but as it follow there the land be pollute with blood therefore be the wrath of the lord kindle against his people insomuch that he abhor his own inheritance the kill of their children though it be fashionable be charge on them as innocent blood and so have in the account of god the guilt of murder as the offer them to idols have the guilt of idolatry be it then as sir robert say that anciently it be usual for men to sell and castrate their children o let it be that they expose them add to it if you please for this be still greater power that they beget them for their table to fat and eat them if this prove a right to do so we may by the same argument justify adultery incest and sodomy for there be examples of these too both ancient and modern sin which i suppose have their principal aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriagebed as necessary hereunto in confirmation of this natural authority of the father our author bring a lame proof from the positive command of god in scripture his word be to confirm the natural right of regal power we find in the decalogue that the law which enjoin obedience to kings be deliver in the term honour thy father p whereas many confess that government only in the abstract be the ordinance of god they be not able to prove any such ordinance in the scripture but only in the fatherly power and therefore we find the commandment that enjoin obedience to superiors give in the term honour thy father so that not only the power and right of government but the form of the power govern and the person have the power be all the ordinances of god the first father have not only simply power but power monarchical as he be father immediately from god o to the same purpose the same law be cite lay our author in several other place and just after the same fashion that be and mother as apocryphal word be always leave out a great argument of our author ingenuity and the goodness of his cause which require in its defender zeal to a degree of warmth able to warp the sacred rule of the word of god to make it comply with his present occasion a way of proceed not unusual to those who embrace not truths because reason and revelation offer them but espouse tenets and party for end deferent from truth and then resolve at any rate to defend then and so do with the word and sense of author they would fit to their purpose just as procrustes do with his guests lop or stretch them as clay best fit them to the size of their notions and they always prove like those so serve deform lame and useless for have our author set down this command without garble as god give it and join another to father every reader would have see that it have make directly against him and that it be so far from establish the monarchical power of the father that it set up the mother equal with him and enjoin zing but be due in common to both father and mother for that be the constant tenour of the scripture honour thy father and thy another exod xx he that smiteth his father or mother shall surely be put to death xx he that curseth his father or mother shall surely be put to death ver repeat lev xx and by our saviour matth xv ye shall fear every man his mother and his father lev xix if any man have a rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother then shall his father and his mother lay hold an him and say this our son be stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice deut xxi curse be he that setteth light by his father or his mother xxvii my son hear the instructions of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother be the word of solomon a king who be not ignorant of what belong to him as a father or a king and yet he join father and mother together in all the instructions he give children quite through his book of proverbs woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou bring forth isa xiv in thee have they set light by father and mother ezeli xxii and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that beget him shall say unto him thou shalt not live and his father anti his mother that beget him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth zech xiii here not the father only but the father and mother jointly have power in this case of life and death thus run the law of the old testament and in the new they be likewise join in the obedience of their children eph vi the rule be children obey your parent and do not remember that i any where read children obey your father and no more the scripture join mother too in that homage which be due from children and have there be any text where the honour or obedience of children have be direct to the father alone it be not likely that our author who pretend to build all upon scripture would have omit it nay the scripture make the authority of father and mother in respect of those they have beget so equal that in some place it neglect even the priority of order which be think due to the father and the mother be put first as lev xix a from which so constantly join father and mother together as be find quite through scripture we may conclude that the honour they have a title to from their children be one common right belong so equally to them both that neither can claim it wholly neither can be exclude one would wonder then how our author infer from the fifth commandment that all power be originally in the father how he find monarchical power of government settle and fix by the commandment honour thy father and thy mother if all the honour due by the commandment be it what it will be the only right of the father because he as our author say have the sovereignty over the woman as be the nobler and principal agent in generation why do god afterwards all along join the mother with him to share in his honour can the father by this sovereignty of his discharge the child front pay this honour to his mother the scripture give no such licence to the jews anal yet there be often breach wide enough betwixt husband and wife even to divorce and separation and i think nobody will say a child may withhold honour from his mother or as the scripture term it set light by her though his father should command him to do so no more than the mother could dispense with him for neglect to honour his father whereby it be plain that this command of god give the father no sovereignty no supremacy i agree with our author that the title to this honour be vest in the parent by nature and be a right which accrue to them by their have beget their children and god by many positive declarations have confirm it to them i also allow our author rule that in grant and gift that have their original from god and nature as the power of the father let me add and mother for whom god hath join together let no man put asunder no inferior power of men can limit nor make any law of prescription against them o so that the mother have by this law of god a right to honour from her children which be not subject to the will of her husband we see this absolute monarchical popover of the father can neither be found on it nor consist with it and he have a power very far from monarchical very far from that absoluteness our author contend for when another have over his subject the same power he hath and by the same title and therefore he can not forbear say himself that he can not see how any man children can be free from subjection to their parent p which in common speech i think signify mother as well as father or if parent here signify only father it be the first time i ever yet know it to do so and by such an use of word one may say any thing by our author doctrine the father have absolute jurisdiction over his children have also the same over their issue and the consequence be good be it true that the father have such a power and yet i ask our author whether the grandfather by his sovereignty could discharge the grandchild from pay to his father the honour due to him by the fifth commandment if the grandfather hath by right of fatherhood sole sovereign power in him and that obedience which be due to the supreme magistrate he command in these word honour thy father it be certain the grandfather might dispense with the grandsons honour his father which since it be evident in common sense he can not it follow from hence that honour thy father and mother can not mean an absolute subjection to a sovereign power but something else belie right therefore which parent have by nature and which be confirm to them by the fifth commandment can not be that political dominion which our author would derive from it for that be in every civil society supreme somewhere can discharge any subject from any political obedience to any one of his fellowsubjects but what law of the magistrate can give a child liberty not to honour his father and mother it be an eternal law annex purely to the relation of parent and children and so contain nothing of the magistrates power in it nor be subject to it our author say god hath give to a father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other o i doubt whether he can alien wholly the right of honour that be due from them but be that as it will this i be sure he can not alien and retain the same power if therefore the magistrates sovereignty be as our author would have it nothing but the authority of a supreme father p it be unavoidable that if the magistrate hath all this paternal right as he must have if fatherhood be the fountain of all authority then the subject though father can have no power over their children no right to honour from them for it can not be all in anothers hand and a part remain with the parent so that accord to our author own doctrine honour thy father and mother can not possibly be understand of political subjec tion and obedience since the laws both in the old and new testament that command children to honour and obey their parent be give to such whose father be under civil government and fellowsubjects with them in political societies and to have bid them honour and obey their parent in our author sense have be to bid them be subject to those who have no title to it the right to obedience from subject be all vest in another and instead of teach obedience this have be to foment sedition by set up power that be not if therefore this command honour thy father and mother concern political dominion it directly overthrow our author monarchy since it be to be pay by every child to his father even in society every father must necessarily have political dominion and there will be as many sovereigns as there be father besides that the mother too hath her title which destroy the sovereignty of one supreme monarch but if honour thy father and mother mean something distinct from political power as necessarily it must it be besides our author business and serve nothing to his purpose the law that enjoin obedience to kings be deliver say our author in the term honour thy father as if all power be originally in the father o and that law be also deliver say i in the term honour thy mother as if all power be originally in the mother i appeal whether the argument be not as good on one side as the other father and mother be join all along in the old and new testament wherever honour or obedience be enjoin children again our author tell us o that this command honour thy father give the right to govern anal make the form of government monarchical to which i answer that if by honour thy father be mean obedience to the political power of the magistrate it concern not any duty we owe to our natural father who be subject because they by our author doctrine be divest of all that power it be place wholly in the prince and so be equally subject and slave with their children can have no light by that title to any such honour or obedience be contain in it political subjection if honour thy father and mother signify the duty we owe our natural parent as by our saviours interpretation matth xv and tall the other mention place it be plain it do then it can not concern political obedience but a duty that it owe to persons who have no title to sovereignty nor any political authority as magistrates ever subject for the person of a private father and a title to obedience due ho the supreme magistrate be things inconsistent and therefore this command which must necessarily comprehend the persons of natural father must mean a duty we owe them distinct from our obedience to the magistrate and from which the most absolute poorer of princes can not absolve us what this duty be we shall in its due place examine and thus we have at last get through all that in our author look like an argument for that absolute unlimited sovereignty describe sect which he sup pose in adam so that mankind have ever since be all bear slave without any title to freedom but if creation which give nothing but a be make not adam prince of his posterity if adam gen i be not constitute lord of mankind nor have a private dominion give him exclusive of his children but only a right and power over the earth and inferior creatures in common with the children of men if also gen iii god give not any particular power to adam over his wife and children but only subject eve to adam as a punishment or foretell the subjection of the weaker sex in the order the common concernments of their families but give not thereby to adam as to the husband power of life and death which necessarily bet long to the magistrate if father by beget their children acquire no such power over them and if the command honour thy father and mother give it not but only enjoin a duty owe to parent equally whether subject or not and to the mother as well as the father if all this be so as i think by what have be say be very evident then man have a natural freedom notwithstanding all our author confidently say to the contrary since all that share in the same common nature faculties and power be in nature equal and ought to partake in the same common right and privilege till the manifest appointment of god who be lord over all bless for ever can be produce show any particular persons supremacy or a man own consent subject him to a superior this be so plain that our author confess that sir john hayward blackwood and barclay the great vindicators of the right of kings could not deny it but admit with one consent the natural liberty and equality of mankind for a truth unquestionable and our author hath be so far from produce any thing that may make good his great position that adam be absolute monarch and so men be not naturally free that even his own proof make against him so that to use his own way of argue the first erroneous principle fail the whole fabric of this vast engine of absolute power and tyranny drop down of itself and there need no more to be say in answer to all that he build upon so false and frail a foundation but to save others the pain be there any need he be not spar himself to show by his own contradictions the weakness of his own doctrine adams absolute and sole dominion be that which he be every where full of and all along build on and yet he tell us p that as adam be lord of his children so his children under him have a command and power over their own children the unlimited and undivided sovereignty of adams fatherhood by our author computation stand but a little while only during the first generation but as soon as he have grandchildren sir robert could give but a very ill account of it adam as father of his children saith he hath an absolute unlimited royal power over them and by virtue thereof over those that they beget and so to all generations and yet his children viz cain and seth have a paternal power over their children at the same time so that they be at the same time absolute lordsand yet vassals and slave adam have all the authority as grandfather of the people and they have a part of it as father of a part of them he be absolute over them and their posterity by have beget them and yet they be absolute over their children by the same title no say our author adams children under him have power over their own children but still with subordination to the first parent a good distinction that sound well and it be pity it signify nothing nor can be reconcile with our author word i readily grant that suppose adams absolute power over his posterity any of his children might hare from him a delegate and so a subordinate power over a part or all the rest but that can not be the power our author speak of here it be not a power by grant and commission but the natural paternal power he suppose a father to have over his children for he say as adam be lord of his children so his children under him have a power over their own children they be then lord over their own children after the same manner and by the same title that adam be ie by right of generation by right of fatherhood it be plain he mean the natural power of father because he limit it to be only over their own children a delegate power have no such limitation as only over their own children it might be over others be well as their own children if it be a delegate power it must appear in scripture but there be no grind in scripture to affirm that adams children have any other power over theirs than what they naturally have as father but that he mean here paternal power and no other be past doubt from the inference he make ill these word immediately follow i see not then how the children of adam or of any man else can be free from subjection to their parent whereby it appear that the power on one side and the subjection on the other our author here speak of be that natural power and subjection between parent and children for that which every mens children owe could be no other and that our author always affirm to be absolute and unlimited this natural power of parent over their children adam have over his posterity say our author and this power of parent over their children his children have over theirs in his lifetime say our author also so that adam by a natural right of father have an absolute unlimited power over all his posterity anal at the saline time his children have by the same right absolute unlimited power over theirs here then be two absolute unlimited power exist together which i would love any body reconcile one to another or to common sense for the salvo he have put in of subordination make it more absurd to have one absolute unlimited nay unlimitable power in subordination to another be so manifest a contradiction that nothing can be more adam be absolute prince with the un limit authority of fatherhood over all his posterity all his posterity be then absolutely his subject anal as our author say his slave children and grandchildren be equally in this state of subjection and slavery and yet say our author the children of adam have paternal ie absolute unlimited power over their own children which in plain english be they be slave and absolute princes at the same time and in the same government and one part of the sum jects have an absolute unlimited power over the other by the natural right of parentage if any one will suppose in favour of our author that he here mean that parent who be in subjection themselves to the absolute authority of their father have yet some power over their children i confess he be something nearer the truth but he will not at all hereby help our author for he nowhere speak of the paternal power but as an absolute unlimited authority can not be suppose to understand any thing else here unless he himself have limit it and show how far it reach and that he mean here paternal authority in that large extent be plain from the immediately follow word this subjection of children be say he the foundation of all regal authority p the subjection then that in the former line he say every man be in to his parent and consequently what adams grandchildren be in to their parent be that which be the fountain of all regal authority ie accord to our author absolute unlimitable authority and thus adams children have regal authority over their children whilst they themselves be subject to their father and fellowsubjects with their children but him mean as he please it be plain he allow adams children to have paternal power p as also all other father to have paternal power over their children o from whence one of these two things will necessarily follow that either adams children even in his life time have and so all other father have as he phrase it p by right of fatherhood royal authority over their children or else that adam by right of fatherhood have not royal authority for it can not be lout that paternal power do or do not give royal authority to them that have it if it do not then adam could not be sovereign by this title nor any body else and then there be an end of all our author politics at once if it do give royal authority then every one that have paternal power have royal authority and then by our author patriarchal government there will be as many kings as there be father an i thus what a monarchy he hath set up let him and his disciples consider princes certainly will have great reason to thank him for these new politics which set up as many absolute kings in every country as there be father of children and yet who can blame our author for it it lie unavoidably in the way of one discourse upon our author principles for have place an absolute power in father by right of beget he could not easily resolve how much of this power belong to a son over the children he have beget and so it fell out to be a very hard matter to give all the power as he do to adam and yet allow a part in his life time to his children when they be parent and which he know not well how to deny them this make him so doubtful in his expressions and so uncertain where to place this absolute natural power which he call fatherhood sometimes adam alone have it all as p o and pref sometimes parent have it which word scarce signify the father alone p sometimes children during their father lifetime as p sometimes father of families as p sometimes father indefinitely o sometimes the heir to adam o sometimes the posterity of adam sometimes prime father all sons of grandchildren of noah o sometimes the eldest parent p sometimes all kings p sometimes all that have supreme power o sometimes heirs to those first progenitors who be at first the natural parent of the whole people p sometimes an elective king p sometimes those whether a few or a multitude that govern the commonweath p sometimes he that can catch it an usurper p o thus this new nothing that be to carry with it all power authority and government this fatherhood which be to design the person and establish the throne of monarchs whom the people be to obey may accord to sir robert come into any hand any how and so by his politics give to democracy royal authority and make an usurper a lawful prince and if it will do all these fine feats much good do our author and all his followers with their omnipotent fatherhood which can serve for nothing but to unsettle and destroy all the lawful governments in the world and to establish in their room disorder tyranny and usurpation ii of fatherhood and property consider together as fountains of sovereignty in the forego chapters we have see what adams monarchy be in our author opinion and upon what title he found it the foundations which he lay the chief stress on as those from which he think he may best derive monarchical power to future princes be two viz fatherhood and property and therefore the way he propose to remove the absurdities and inconveniencies of the doctrine of natural freedom be to maintain the natural and private dominion of adam o conformable hereunto he tell us the ground and principles of government necessarily depend upon the original of property o the subjection of children to their parent be the fountain of all regal authority p and all power on earth be either derive or usurp from the fatherly power there be no other original to be find of any power whatsoever o i will not stand here to examine how it can be say without a contradiction that the first ground and principles of government necessarily depend upon the original of property and yet that there be no other original of any power whatsoever but that of the father it be hard to understand how there can be no other original but fatherhood and yet that the ground and principles of government depend upon the original of property property and fatherhood be as far different as lord of a manor and father of children nor do i see how they will either of them agree with what our author say o of gods sentence against eve gen iii that it be the original grant of government so that if that be the original government have not its original by our author own confession either from property or fatherhood and this text which he bring as a proof of adams power over eve necessarily contradict what he say of the fatherhood that it be the sole fountain of all power for if adam have any such regal power over eve as our author contend for it must be by some other title than that of beget but i leave him to reconcile these contradictions as well as many others which may plentifully be find in him by any one who will but read him with a little attention and shall come now to consider how these two originals of government adams natural and private dominion will consist and serve to make out and establish the title of succeed monarchs who as our author oblige them must all derive their popover from these fountains let us then suppose adam make by gods donation lord and sole proprietor of the whole earth in as large and ample a manner as sir robert could wish let us suppose him also by right of fatherhood absolute ruler over his children with an unlimited supremacy i ask then upon adams death what become of both his natural and private domination and i doubt not it will be answer that they descend to his next heir as our author tell us in several place but this way it be plain can not possibly convey both his natural and private dominion to the same person for should we allow that all the property all the estate of the father ought to descend to the eldest son which will need some proof to establish it and so he have by that title all the private dominion of the father yet the father natural dominion the paternal power can not descend to him by inheritance for it be a right that accrue to a man only by beget no man can have this natural dominion over any one he do not beget unless it can be suppose that a man can have a right to any thing without do that upon which that right be solely found for if a father by beget and no other title have natural dominion over his children he that do not beget them can not have this natural dominion over them and therefore be it true or false that our author say o that every man that be bear by his very birth become a subject to him that beget him this necessarily follow viz that a man by his birth can not become a subject to his brother who do not beget him unless it can be suppose that a man by the very same title can come to be under the natural and absolute dominion of two different men at once or it be sense to say that a man by birth be under the natural dominion of his father only because he beget him and a man by birth also be under the natural dominion of his eldest brother though he do not beget him if then the private dominion of adam ie his property in the creatures descend at his death all entirely to his eldest son his heir for if it do not there be presently an end of all sir roberts monarchy and his natural dominion the dominion a father have over his children by beget them belong immediately upon adams decease equally to all his sons who have children by the same title their father have it the sovereignty found upon property and the sovereignty found upon fatherhood come to be divide since cain as heir have that of property alone seth and the other sons that of fatherhood equally with him this be the best can be make of our author doctrine and of the two title of sovereignty he set up in adam one of them will either signify nothing or if they both must stand they can serve only to confound the right of princes and disorder government in his posterity for by build upon two title to dominion which can not descend together and which he allow may be separate for he yield that adams children have their distinct territories by right of private dominion o p he make it perpetually a doubt upon his principles where the sovereignty be or to whom we owe our obedience since fatherhood and property be distinct title and begin presently upon adams death to be in distinct persons and which then be to give way to the other let us take the account of it as he himself give it us he tell us out of grotius that adams children by donation assignation or some kind of cession before he be dead have their distinct territories by right of private dominion abel have his flock and pasture for them cain have his field for corn and the land of nod where he build him a city o here it be obvious to demand which of these two after adams death be sovereign cain say our author p by what title as heir for heirs to progenitors who be natural parent of their people be not only lord of their own children but also of their brethren say our author p what be cain heir to not the entire possessions not all that which adam have private dominion in for our author allow that abel by a title derive from his father have his distinct territory for pasture by right of private dominion what then abel have by private dominion be exempt from cains dominion for he could not have private dominion over that which be under the private dominion of another and therefore his sovereignty over his brother be go with this private dominion and so there be presently two sovereigns and his imaginary title of fatherhood be out of doors and cain be no prince over his brother or else if cain retain his sovereignty over abel notwithstanding his private dominion it will follow that the first ground and principles of government have nothing to do with property whatever our author say to the contrary it be true abel do not outlive his father adam but that make nothing to the argument which will hold good against sir robert in abels issue or in seth or any of the posterity of adam not descend from cain the same inconvenience he run into about the three sons of noah who as he say p have the whole world divide amongst them by their father i ask then in which of the three we shall find the establishment of regal power after noahs death if in all three as our author there seem to say then it will follow that regal power be found in property of land and follow private dominion and not in paternal power or natural dominion and so there be an end of paternal power as the fountain of regal authority and the so much magnify fatherhood quite vanish if the regal power descend to shem as eldest and heir to his father then noahs division of the world by lot to his sons or his ten years sail about the mediterranean to appoint each son his part which our author tell of p be labour lose his division of the world to them be to ill or to no purpose for his grant to cham and japhet be little worth if shem notwithstanding this grant as soon as noah be dead be to be lord over them or if this grant of private dominion to them over their assign territories be good here be set up two distinct sort of power not subordinate one to the other with all those inconveniencies which he muster up against the power of the people o which i shall set down in his own word only change property or people all power on earth be either derive or usurper from the fatherly power there be no other original to be find of any power whatsoever for if there should be grant two sort of power without any subordination of one to the other they would be in perpetual strife which should be supreme for two supremes can not agree if the fatherly power be supreme then the power ground on private dominion must be subordinate and depend on it and if the power ground on property be supreme then the fatherly power must submit to it and can not be exercise without the licence of the proprietors which must quite destroy the frame and course of nature this be his own argue against two distinct independent power which i have set down in his own word only put power rise from property for power of the people and when he have answer what he himself have urge here against two distinct power we shall be better able to see how with any tolerable sense he can derive all regal authority from the natural anal private dominion of adam from fatherhood and property together which be distinct title that do not always meet in the same persons and it be plain by his own confession presently separate as soon both as adams and noahs death make way for succession though our author frequently in his write jumble them together and omit not to make use of either where he think it will sound best to his purpose but the absurdities of this will more fully appear in the next chapter where we shall examine the ways of coveyance of the sovereignty of adam to princes that be to reign after him iii of the conveyance of adams sovereigns monarchical power sir robert have not be very happy in any proof he bring for the sovereignty of adam be not much more fortunate in convey it to future princes who if his politics be true must all derive their title from that first monarch the ways he have assign as they lie scatter up and down in his write i will set down in his own word in his preface he tell us that adam be monarch of the whole world none of his posterity have any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission or by succession from him here he snake two ways of conveyance of any thing adam stand possess of and those be grant or succession again he say all kings either be or arc to be repute the next heirs to those first progenitors who be at first the natural parent of the whole people p there can not be any multitude of men whatsoever but that in it consider by itself there be one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be the king of all the rest as be the next heir to adam o here in these place inheritance be the only way he allow of convey monarchical power to princes in other place he tell us o all power on earth be either derive or usurp from the fatherly power o all kings that now be or ever be be or be either father of their people or heirs of such father or usurpers of the right of such father o and here he make inheritance or usurpation the only way whereby kings come by this original power but yet he tell us this fatherly empire as it be of itself hereditary so it be alienable by patent and seizable by an usurper o so then here inheritance grant or usurpation will convey it and last of all which be most admirable he tell us p it skills not which way kings come by their power whether by election donation succession or by any other mean for it be still the manner of the government by supreme popover that make them properly kings and not the mean of obtain their crown which i think be a full answer to all his whole hypothesis and discourse about adams royal authority as the fountain from which all princes be to derive theirs and he might have spar the trouble of speak so much as he do up and down of heirs and inheritance if to make any one properly a king need no more but govern by supreme power and it matter not by what mean he come by it by this notable way our author may make oliver as properly king as any one else he could think of and have he have the happiness to live under massaniellos government he could not by this his own rule have forbear to have do homage to him with o king live for ever since the manner of his government by supreme power make him properly king who be but the day before properly a fisherman and if don quixote have teach his squire to govern with supreme authority our author no doubt could have make a most loyal subject in sancho panchas island he must need have deserve some preferment in such governments since i think he be the first politician who pretend to settle government upon its true basis renal to establish the throne of lawful princes ever tell the world that he be properly a king whose manner of government be by supreme power by what mean soever he obtain it which in plain english be to say that regal and supreme power be properly and truly his who can by any mean seize upon it and if this be to be properly a king i wonder how he come to think of or where he will find an usurper this be so strange a doctrine that the surprise of it hath make me pass by without their due reflection the contradictions he run into by make sometimes inheritance alone sometimes only grant or inheritance sometimes only inheritance or usurpation sometimes all these three and at last election or any other mean add to them the ways whereby adams royal authority that be his right to supreme rule could be convey down to future kings and governors so as to give them a title to the obedience and subjection of the people but these contradictions lie so open that the very read of our author own word will discover them to any ordinary understand and though what i have quote out of him with abundance more of the same strain and coherence which might be find in him might well excuse me from any farther treble in this argument yet have propose to myself to examine the main part of his doctrine i shall a little more particularly consider how inheritance grant usurpation or election can any way make out government in the world upon his principles or derive to any one a right of empire froin this regal authority of adam have it be ever so well prove that he have be absolute monarch and lord of the whole world of monarchy by inheritance from adam though it be ever so plain that there ought to be government in the world nay should all men be of our author mind that divine appointment have ordain it to be monarchical yet since men can not obey any thing that can not command and ideas of government in the fancy though ever so perfect though ever so right can not give laws nor prescribe rule to the action of men it would be of no behoof for the settle of order and establishment of government in its exercise and use amongst men unless there be a way also teach how to know the person to whom it belong to have this power and exercise this dominion over others it be in vain then to talk of subjection and obedience without tell us whom we be to obey for be i ever so fully persuade that there ought to be magistracy and rule in the world yet i be nevertheless at liberty still till it appear who be the person that hath right to my obedience since if there be no mark to know him by and distinguish him that hath right to rule from other men it may be myself as well as any other and therefore though submission to government be every ones duty yet since that signify nothing but submit to the direction and laws of such men as have authority to command it be not enough to make a man a subject to convince him that there be regal power in the world but there must be ways of design and know the person to whom this regal power of right belong and a man can never be oblige in conscience to submit to any power unless he can be satisfy who be the person who have a right to exercise that power over him if this be not so there would be no distinction between pirate and lawful princes he that have force be without any more ado to be obey and crown and sceptres would become the inheritance only of violence and rapine men too might as often and as innocently change their governors as they do their physicians if the person can not be know who have a right to direct me and whose prescriptions i be bind to follow to settle therefore mens consciences under an obligation to obedience it be necessary that they know not only that there be a power somewhere in the world but the person who by right be vest with this power over them how successful our author have be in his attempt to set up a monarchical absolute power in adam the reader may judge by what have be already say but be that absolute monarchy as clear as our author would desire it as i presume it be the contrary yet it could be of no use to the government of mankind now in the world unless he also make out these two things first that this power of adam be not to end with him but be upon his decease convey entire to some other person and so on to posterity secondly that the princes and rulers now on earth be possess of this power of adam by a right way of conveyance derive to them if the first of these fail the power of adam be it ever so great ever so certain will signify nothing to the present government and societies in the world but we must seek out some other original of power for the government of polities than this of adam or else there will be none at all in the world if the latter fail it will destroy the authority of the present governors and absolve the people from subjection to them since they have no better claim than others to that power which be alone the fountain of all authority can have no title to rule over them our author have fancy an absolute sovereignty in adam mention several ways of its conveyance to princes that be to be his successors but that which he chiefly insist on be that of inheritance which occur so often in his several discourse and i have in the forego chapter quote several of these passages i shall not need here again to repeat them this sovereignty he erect as have be say upon a double foundation viz that of property and that of fatherhood one be the right he be suppose to have in all creatures a right to possess the earth with the beasts and other inferior rank of things in it for his private use exclusive of all other men the other be the right he be suppose to have to rule and govern men all the rest of mankind in both these right there be suppose an exclusion of all other men it must be upon some reason peculiar to adam that they must both be found that of his property our author suppose to rise from gods immediate donation gen i and that of fatherhood from the act of beget now in all inheritance if the heir succeed not to the reason upon which his father right be found he can not succeed to the right which followeth from it for example adam have a right of property in the creatures upon the donation and grant of god almighty who be lord and proprietor ofthem all let this be so as our author tell us yet upon his death his heir can have no title to them no such right of property in them unless the same reason viz gods donation vest a right in the heir too for if adam could have have no property in nor use of the creatures without this positive donation from god and this donation be only personally to adam his heir could have no right by it but upon his death it must revert to god the lord and owner again for positive grant give no title farther than the express word convey it and by which only it be hold and thus if as our author himself contend that donation gen i be make only to adam personally his heir could not succeed to his property in the creatures and if it be a donation to any but adam let it be show that it be to his heir in our author sense ie to one of his children exclusive of all the rest but not to follow our author too far out of the way the plain of the case be this god have make man and plant in him as in all other animals a strong desire of selfpreservation and furnish the world with things fit for food and raiment and other necessaries of life subservient to his design that man should live and abide for some time upon the face of the earth and not that so curious and wonderful a piece of workmanship by his own negligence or want of necessaries should perish again presently after a few moments continuance god i say have make man and the world thus speak to him that be direct him by his sense and reason as he do the inferior animals by their sense and instinct which be serviceable for his subsistence and give him as the mean of his preservation and therefore i could not but before these word be pronounce gen i if they must be understand literally to have be speak and without any such verbal donation man have a right to an use of the creatures by the will and grant of god for the desire strong desire of preserve his life and be have be plant in him as a principle of action by god himself reason which be the voice of god in him could not but teach him and assure him that pursue that natural inclination he have to preserve his be he follow the will of his maker and therefore have a right to make use of those creatures which by his rear son or sense he could discover would be serviceable thereunto and thus man property in the creatures be found upon the right he have to make use of those things that be necessary or useful to his be this be the reason and foundation of adams property give the same title on the same grind to all his children not only after his death but in his life time so that here be no privilege of his heir above his other children which could exclude them from an equal right to the use of the inferior creatures for the comfortable preservation of their be which be all the property man hath in them and so adams sovereignty build on property or as our author call it private dominion come to nothing every man have a right to the creatures by the same title adam have viz by the right every one have to take care of and provide for their subsistence and thus men have a right in common adams children in common with him but if any one lead begin and make himself a property in any particular thing which how he or any one else could do shall be show in another place that thing that possession if he dispose not otherwise of it by his positive grant descend naturally to his children and they have a right to succeed to it and possess it it might reasonably be ask here how cone children by this right of possess before any other the properties of their parent upon their decease for it be personally the parent when they die without actually transfer their right to another why do it not return again to the common stock of mankind it perhaps be answer that common consent hath dispose of it totheir children common practice we see indeed do so dispose of it but we can not say that it be the common consent of mankind for that hath never be ask nor actually give and it common tacit consent hath establish it it would make but a positive and not a natural right of children to inherit the goods of their parent but where the practice be universal it be reason able to think the cause be natural the grind then i think to be this the first and strongest desire god plant in men and work into the very principles of their nature be that of selfpreservation that be the foundation of a right to the creatures for the particular support and use of each individual person himself but next to this god plant in men a strong desire also of propagate their kind and continue themselves in their posterity and this give children a title to share in the property of their parent and a right to inherit their possessions men be not proprietors of what they have merely for themselves their children have a title to part of it and have their kind of right join with their parent in the possession which come to be wholly theirs when death have put an end to their parent use of it hath take them from their possessions and this eve call inheritance men be by a like obligation bind to preserve what they have beget as to preserve themselves their issue come to have a right in the goods they be possess of that children have such a right be plain from the laws of god and that men arc convince that children have surly a right be evident from the law of the land both which laws require parent to provide for their children for children be by the course of nature bear weak and unable to provide for themselves they have by the appointment of god himself who hath thus order the course of nature a right to be nourish and maintain by their parent nay a right not only to a bare subsistence but to the convenicncics and comfort of life as far as the condition of their parent can afford it hence it come that when their parent leave the world and so the care due to their children cease the effect of it be to extend as far as possibly they can and the provision they have make in their lifetime be understand to be intendecl as nature require they should for their children whom after themselves they be bind to provide for though the die parent by express word declare nothing about them nature appoint the descent of their property to their children who thus come to have a title and natural right of inheritance to their father goods which the rest of mankind can not pretend to be it not for this right of be nourish and maintain by their parent which god and nature have give to children and oblige parent to as a duty it would be reasonable that the father should inherit the estate of his son and be prefer in the inheritance before his grandchild for to the grandfather there be due a long score of care and expense lay out upon the breed and education of his son which one would think in justice ought to be pay but that hay teen do in obedience to the same law whereby he receive nourishment and education from his own parent this score of education receive from a man father be pay by take care and provide for his own children be pay i say as much as be require of payment by alteration of property unless present necessity of the parent require a return of goods for their necessary support and subsistence for we be not now speak of that reverence acknowledgment respect and honour that be always due from children to their parent but of possessions and commodities of life valuable by money but though it be incumbent on parent to bring up and provide for their children yet this debt to their children do not quite cancel the score to their parent but only be make by nature preferable to it for the debt a man owe his father take place and give the father a right to inherit the sons goods where for want of issue the right of issue doth not exclude that title and therefore a man have a right to be maintain by his children where he need it and to enjoy also the comfort of life from them when the necessary provision due to them end their children will afford it if his son die without issue the father have a right in nature to possess his goods and inherit his estate whatever the municipal laws of some countries may absurdly direct otherwise and so again his children and their issue from him or for want of such his father and his issue but where no such be to be find ie no kindred there we see the possessions of a private man revert to the community and so in politic societies come into the hand of the public magistrate but in the state of nature become again perfectly common nobody have a right to inherit them nor can any one have a property in them otherwise than in any other things common by nature of which i shall speak in its due place i have be the larger in show upon what grind children have a right to succeedto the possession of their father properties not only because by it it will appear that if addend have a property a titular insignificant useless property for it could be no better for he be bind to nourish and maintain his children and posterity out of it in the whole earth and its product yet all his children come to have by the law of nature and right of inheritance a joint title and a right of property in it after his death it could convey no right of sovereignty to any one of his posterity over the rest since every one have a right of inheritance to his portion they might enjoy their inheritance or any part of it in common or share it or some part of it by division as it best like them but no one could pretend to the whole inheritance or any sovereignty suppose to accompany it since a right of inheritance give every one of the rest as well as any one a title to share in the goods of his father not only upon this account i say have i be so particular in examine the reason of childrens inherit the property of their father but also because it will give us farther light in the inheritance of rule and power which in countries where their particular municipal laws give the whole possession of land entirely to the firstborn and descent of power have go so to men by this custom that some have be apt to be deceive into an opinion that there be a natural or divine right of primogeniture to both estate and power and that the inheritance of both rule over men and property in things spring from the same original and be to descend by the same rule property whose original be from the right a man have to use any of the inferior creatures for the subsistence and comfort of his life be for the benefit and sole advantage of the proprietor so that he may even destroy the thing that he have property in by his use of it where need require but government be for the preservation of every man right and property by preserve him from the violence or injury of others be for the good of the govern for the magistrates sword be for a terror to evil doers and by that terror to enforce men to observe the positive laws of the society make conformable to the laws of nature for the public good ie the good of every particular member of that society as far as by common rule it can be provide for the sword be not give the magistrate for his own good alone children therefore as have be show by the dependence they have on their parent for subsistence have a right of inheritance to their father property as that which belong to them for their proper good and behoof and therefore be fitly term goods wherein the firstborn have not a sole or peculiar right by any law of god and nature the younger children have an equal title with him found on that right they all have to maintenance support and comfort from their parent and on nothing else but government be for the benefit of the govern and not the sole advantage of the governors but only for theirs with the rest as they make a part of that politic body each of whose part and members be take care of and direct in its peculiar function for the good of the whole by the laws of society can not be inherit by the same title that children have to the goods of their father the right a son have to be maintain and provide with the necessaries and conveniencies of life out of his father stock give him a right to succeed to his father property for his own good but this can give him no right to succeed also to the rule which his father have over other men all that a child have right to claim from his father be nourishment and education and the things nature furnish for the support of life but he have no right to demand rule or dominion from him he can subsist and receive from him the portion of good things and advantage of education naturally due to him without empire and dominion that if his father hath any be vest in him for the good and behoof of others and therefore the son can not claim or inherit it by a title which be found wholly on his own private good and advantage we must know low the first ruler from whom any one claim come by his authority upon what grind any one have empire what his title be to it before we can know who have a right to succeed him in it and inherit it from him if the agreement and consent of men first give a sceptre into any ones hand or put a crown on his head that also must direct its descent and conveyance for the same authority that make the first a lawful ruler must make the second too and so give right of succession in this case inheritance or primogeniture can in itself have no right no presence to it any farther than that consent which establish the form of the government hath so settle the succession and thus we see the succession of crown in several countries place it on different head and he come by right of succession to be a prince in one place who would be a subject in another if god by his positive grant and reveal declaration first give rule and dominion to any man he that will claim by that title must have the same positive grant of god for his succession for if that have not direct the course of its descent and conveyance clown to others nobody can succeed to this title of the first ruler children have no right of inheritance to this and primogeniture can lay no claim to it unless god the author of this constitution hath so ordain it thus we see the pretensions of sauls family who receive his crown from the immediate appointment of god end with his reign and david by the same title that saul reign viz gods appointment succeed in his throne to the exclusion of jonathan and all pretensions of paternal inheritance and if solomon have a right to succeed his father it must be by some other title than that of primogeniture a cadet or sisters son must have the preference in succession if he have the same title the first lawful prince have and in dominion that have its foundation only in the positive appointment of god himself benjamin the youngest must have the inheritance of the crown if god so direct as well as one of that tribe have the first possession if paternal right the act of beget give a man rule and dominion inheritance or primogeniture can give no title for he that can not succeed to his father title which be beget can not succeed to that power over his brethren which his father have by paternal right over them but of this i shall have occasion to say more in another place this be plain in the meantime that any government whether suppose to be at first found in paternal right consent of the people or the positive appointment of god himself which can supersede either of the other and so begin a new government upon a new foundation i say any government begin upon either of these can by right of succession come to those only who have the title of him they succeed to power found on contract can descend only to him who have right by that contract power found on beget he only can have that beget and power found on the positive grant or donation of god he only can have by right of succession to whom that grant direct it from what i have say i think this be clear that a right to the use of the creatures be found originally in the right a man have to subsist and enjoy the conveniencies of life and the natural right children have to inherit the goods of their parent be found in the right they have to the same subsistence and commodities of life out of the stock of their parent who be therefore teach by natural love and tenderness to provide for them as a part of themselves and all this be only for the good of the proprietor or heir it can be no reason for childrens inherit of rule and dominion which have another original and a different end nor can primogeniture have any presence to a right of solely inherit either property or power as we shall in its due place see more fully it be enough to have show here that adams property or private dominion could not convey any sovereignty or rule to his heir who not have a right to inherit all his father possessions could not thereby come to have any sovereignty over his brethren and therefore if any sovereignty on account of his property have be vest in adam which in truth there be not yet it would have die with him as adams sovereignty if by virtue of be proprietor of the world he have any authority over men could not have be inherit by any of his children over the rest because they have the same title to divide the inheritance and every one have a right to a portion of his father possessions so neither could adams sovereignty by right of fatherhood if any such he have descend to any one of his children for it be in our author account a right acquire by beget to rule over those he have beget it be not a power possible to be inherit because the right be consequent to and build on an act perfectly personal make that power so too and impossible to be inherit for paternal power be a natural right rise only from the relation of father and son be as impossible to be inherit as the relation itself and a man may pretend as well to inherit the conjugal power of the husband whose heir he be have over his wife as he can to inherit the paternal power a father over his children for the power of the husband be found on contract and the power of the father on beget he may as well inherit the power obtain by the conjugal contract which be only personal as he may the power obtain by beget which could reach no farther than the person of the begetter unless beget can be a title to power in him that do not beget which make it a reasonable question to ask whether adam die before eve his heir suppose cain or seth should have by right of inherit adams fatherhood sovereign power over eve his mother for adams father hood be nothing but a right he have to govern his children because he beget them he that inherit adams fatherhood inherit nothing even in our author sense but the right adam have to govern his children because he beget them so that the monarchy of the heir would not have take in eve or if it do it be nothing but the fatherhood of adam descend by inheritance the heir must have right to govern love because adam beget her for fatherhood s nothing else perhaps it will be say with our author that a man can alien his power over his child and what may be transfer by compact may be possess by inheritance i answer a father can not alien the power he have over his child he may perhaps to some degrees forfeit it but can not transfer it and if any other man acquire it it be not by the father grant but by some act of his own for example a father unnaturally careless of his child sell or give him to another man and he again expose him a third man find him breed him up cherish and provide for him as his own i think in this case nobody will doubt but that the greatest part of filial duty and subjection be here owe and to be pay to this fosterfather and if any thing could be demand from the child by either of the other it could be only due to his natural father who perhaps might have forfeit his right to much of that duty compre hended in the command honour your parent but could transfer none of it to another he that purchase and neglect the child get by his purchase and grant of the father no title to duty or honour from the child but only he acquire it who by his own authority perform the office and care of a father to the forlorn and perish infant make himself by paternal care a title to proportionable degrees of paternal power this will be more easily admit upon considerations of the nature of paternal power for which i refer my reader to the second book to return to the argument in hand this be evident that paternal power arise only from beget for in that our author place it alone can neither be transfer nor inherit and he that do not beget can no more have paternal power which arise from thence than he can have a right to any thing who perform not the condition to which only it be annex if one should ask by what law have a father power over his children it will be answer no doubt by the law of nature which give such a power over them to him that beget them if one should ask likewise by what law do our author heir come by a right to inherit i think it would be answer by the law of nature too for i find not that our author bring one word of scripture to prove the right of such an heir he speak of why then the law of nature give father paternal power over their children because they do beget them and the same law of nature give the paternal power to the heir over his brethren who do not beget them whence it follow that either the father have not his paternal power by beget or else that the heir have it not at all for it be hard to understand how the law of nature which be the law of reason can give the paternal power to the father over his children for the only reason of beget and to the firstborn over his brethren without this only reason ie for no reason at all and if the eldest by the law of nature can inherit this paternal power without the only reason that give a title to it so may the youngest as well as he and a stranger as well as either for where there be no reason for any one as there be not but for him that beget all have an equal title i be sure our author offer no reason and when any body do we shall see whether it will hold or no in the mean time it be as good sense to say that by the law of nature a man have right to inherit the property of another because he be of kin to him and be know to be of his blood and therefore by the same law of nature an utter stranger to his blood have right to inherit his estate as to say that by the law of nature he that beget them have paternal power over his children and therefore by the law of nature the heir that beget them not have this paternal power over them or suppose the law of the land give absolute power over their children to such only who nurse them and feed their children themselves could any body pretend that this law give any one who do no such thing absolute power over those who be not his children when therefore it can be show that conjugal power can belong to him that be not an husband it will also i believe be prove that our author paternal power acquire by beget may be inherit by a son and that a brother as heir to his father power may have paternal power over his brethren and by the same rule conjugal power too but till then i think we may rest satisfy that the paternal power of adam this sovereign authority of fatherhood be there any such could not descend to nor be inherit by his next heir fatherly power i easily grant our author if it will do him any good can never be lose because it will be as long in the world as there be father but none of then will have adams paternal power or derive theirs from him but every one will have his own by the same title adam have his viz by beget but not by inheritance or succession no more than husband have their conjugal power by inheritance from adam and thus we see as adam have no such property no such paternal power as give him sovereign jurisdiction over mankind so likewise his sovereignty build upon either of these title if he have any such could not have descend to his heir but must have end with him adam therefore as have be prove be neither monarch nor his imaginary monarchy hereditable the power which be now in the world be not that which be adams since all that adam could have upon our author ground either of property or fatherhood necessarily cry with him and could not be convey to posterity by inheritance in the next place we will consider whether adam have any such heir to inherit his power as our author talk of of the heir to adams monarchical power our author tell us o that it be a truth undeniable that there can not be any multitude of men whatsoever either great or small though gather together from the several corner and remotest regions of the world but that in the same multitude consider by itself there be one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be king of all the rest as be the next heir to adam and all the other subject to him every man by nature be a king or a subject and again p if adam himself be still live and now ready to die it be certain that there be one man and but one in the world who be next heir let this multitude of men be if our author please all the princes upon the earth there will then be by our author rule one amongst them that in nature hath a right to be king of all the rest as be the right heir to adam an excellent way to establish the throne of princes and settle the obedience of their subject by set up an hundred or perhaps a thousand title if there be so many princes in the world against any king now reign each as good upon our author ground as his who wear the crown if this right of heir carrier any weight with it if it be the ordinance of god as our author seem to tell us o must not all be subject to it from the highest to the lowest can those who wear the name of princes without have the right of be heirs to adam demand obedience from their subject by this title and not be bind to pay it by the same law either governments in the world be not to be claim and hold by this title of adams heir and then the start of it be to no purpose the be or not be adams heir signify nothing as to the title of dominion or if it really be as our author say the true title to government and sovereignty the first thing to be do be to find out this true heir of adam seat him in his throne and then all the kings and princes of the world ought to come and resign up their crown and sceptres to him as things that belong no more to them than to any of their subject for either this right in nature of adams heir to be king over all the race of men for all together they make one multitude be a right not necessary to the make of a lawful king and so there may be lawful kings without it and then kings title and pointer depend not on it or else all the kings in the world but one be not lawful kings and so have no right to obedience either this title of heir to adam be that whereby kings hold their crown and have a right to subjection from their subject and then one only can have it and the rest be subject can require no obedience from other men w ho be but their fellowsubjects or else it be not the title whereby kings rule and have a right to obedience from their subject and then kings be kings without it and this dream of the natural sovereignty of adams heir be of no use to obedience and government for if kings be a right to dominion and the obedience of their subject who be not nor can possibly be heirs to adam what use be there of such a title when we be oblige to obey without it if kings who be not heirs to adam have no right to sovereignty we be all free till our author or any body for him will show us adams right heir if there be but one heir of adam there can be but one lawful king in the world and noborly in conscience can be oblige to obedience till it be resolve who that be for it may be any one who be notknown to be of a younger house and all others have equal title if there be more than one heir of adam every one be his heir and so every one have regal power for if two sons can be heirs together then all the sons equally be heirs and so all be heirs be all sons or sons sons of adam betwixt these two the right of heir can not stand for by it either but one only man or all men be kings take which you please it dissolve the bond of government and obedience since if all men be heirs they can owe obedience to nobody if only one nobody can be oblige to pay obedience to him till he be know and his title make out who heir the great question which in all age have disturb mankind and bring on them the greatest part of those mischiefs which have ruin cities depopulate countries and disorder the peace of the world have be not whether there be power in the world nor whence it come but who should have it the settle of this point be of no smaller moment than the security of princes and the peace and welfare of their estates and kingdoms a reformer of politics one would think should lay this sure and be very clear in it for if this remain disputable all the rest will be to very little purpose and the skill use in dress up power with all the splendor and temptation absoluteness can add to it without show who have a right to have it will serve only to give a greater edge to man natural ambition which of itself be but too keen what can this do but set men on the more eagerly to scramble and so lay a sure and last foundation of endless contention and disorder instead of that peace and tranquillity which be the blurriness of government and the end of human society this designation of the person our author be more than ordinary oblige to take care of because he affirm that the assignment of civil power be by divine institution hath make the conveyance as well as the power itself sacred so that no consideration no act or art of man can divert it from that person to whom by this divine right it be assign no necessity or contrivance can substitute another person in his room for if the assignment of civil power be by divine institution and adams heir be he to whom it be thus assign as in the forego chapter our author tell us it would be as much sacrilege for any one to be king who be not adams heir as it would have be amongst the jews for any one to have be priest who have not be of aarons posterity for not only the priesthood in general be by divine institution but the assignment of it to the sole line and posterity of aaron make it impossible to be enjoy or exercise by any one but those persons who revere else offspring of aaron whose succession therefore be carefully observe and by that the persons who have a right to the priesthood certainly know let us see then what care our author have take to make us know who be this heir who by divine institution leas a right to be king over all men the first account of him we meet with be p in these word this subjection of children be the fountain of all regal authority by the ordination of god himself it follow that civil power not only in general be by divine institution but even the assignment of it specifically to the eldest parent matter of such consequence as this be should be in plain word as little liable as might be to doubt or equivocation and i think if language be capable of express any thing distinctly and clearly that of kindred and the several degrees of nearness of blood be one it be therefore to be wish that our author have use a little more intelligible expressions here that we might have better know who it be to whom the assignment of civil power be make by divine institution or at least would have tell us what he mean by eldest parent for i believe if land have be assign or grant to him and the eldest parent of his family he would have think it have need an interpreter and it would scarce have be know to whom next it belong in propriety of speech and certainly propriety of speech be necessary in a discourse of this nature eldest parent signify either the eldest men and women that have have children or those who have longest have issue and then our author assertion will be that those father and mother who have be longest in the world or longest fruitful have by divine institution a right to civil power if there be any absurdity in this our author must answer for it and if his mean be different from my explication he be to be blame that he would not speak it plainly this i be sure parent can not signify heirs male nor eldest parent an infant child who yet may sometimes be the true heir if there can be but one and we be hereby still as much at a loss who civil power belong to notwithstanding this assignment by divine institution as if there have be no such assignment at all or our author have say nothing of it this of eldest parent leave us more in the dark who by divine institution have a right to civil power than those who never hear any thing at all of heir or descent of which our author be so full and though the chief matter of his write be to teach obedience to those who have a right to it which he tell us be convey by descent yet who those be to whom this right by descent belong he leave like the philosophers stone in politics out of the reach of any one to discover from his write this obscurity can not be impute to want of language in so great a master of style as sir robert be when he be resolve with himself what he would say and therefore i fear find how hard it would be to settle rule of descent by divine institution and how little it would be to his purpose or conduce to the clear and establish the title of princes if such rule of descent be settle he choose rather to content himself with doubtful and general term which might make no ill sound in mens ears who be will to he please with them rather than offer any clear rule of descent of this fatherhood of adam by which mens consciences might be satisfy to whom it descend and know the persons who have a right to regal power and with it to their obedience how else be it possible that lay so much stress as he do upon descent and adams heir next heir true heir he should never tell us what heir mean nor the way to know who the next or true heir be this i do not remember he do any where expressly handle but where it come in his way very warily and doubtfully touch though it be so necessary that without it all discourse of government and obedience upon his principles would be to no purpose and fatherly power ever so well make out will be of no use to any body hence he tell us o that not only the constitution of power in general but the limitation of it to one kind ie monarchy and the determination of it to the individual person and line of adam be all three ordinances of god neither eve nor her children could either limit adams power or join others with him and what be give unto adam be give in his person to his posterity here again our author inform us that the divine ordinance hath limit the descent of aclams monarchical power to whom to adams line and posterity say our author a notable limitation a limitation to all mankind for if our author can find any one amongst mankind that be not of the line and posterity of adam he may perhaps tell him who this next heir of adam be but for us i despair how this limitation of adams empire to his line and posterity will help us to find out one heir this limitation indeed of our author will save those the labour who would look for him amongst the race of brutes if any such there be but will very little contribute to the discovery of one next heir amongst men though it make a short and easy determination of the question about the descent of adams regal power by tell us that the line and posterity of adam be to have it that be in plain english any one may have it since there be no person live that hath not the title of be of the line and posterity of adam and while it keep there it keep within our author limitation by gods ordinance indeed p he tell us that such heirs be not only lord of their own children but of their brethren whereby and by the word follow which we shall consider anon he seem to insinuate that the eldest son be heir but he nowhere that i know say it in direct word but by the instance of cain and jacob that there follow we may allow this to be so far his opinion concern heirs that where there be divers children the eldest son have the right to be heir that primogeniture can not give any title to paternal power we have already show that a father may have a natural right to some kind of power over his children be easily grant but that an elder brother have so over his brethren remain to be prove god or nature have not any where that i know place such jurisdiction in the first bear nor can reason find any such natural superiority amongst brethren the law of moses give a double portion of the goods and possessions to the eldest but we find not any here that naturally or by gods institution superiority or dominion belong to him and the instance there bring by our author be but slender proof of a right to civil power and dominion in the first bear and do rather show the contrary his word be in the forecited place and therefore we find god tell cain of his brother abel his desire shall be subject unto thee and thou shalt rule over him to which i answer these word of god to cain be by many interpreters with great reason understand in a quite different sense than what our author use them in whatever be mean by them it could not be that cain as elder have a natural dominion over abel for the word be conditional if thou dost well and so personal to cain and whatever be signify by them do depend on his carriage and not follow his birthright and therefore could by no mean be an establishment of dominion in the firstborn in general for before this abel have his distinct territories by right of private dominion as our author himself confess o which he could not have have to the prejudice of the heirs title if by divine institution cain as heir be to inherit all his father dominion if this be intend by god as the charter of primogeniture and the grant of dominion to the elder brothers in general as such by right of inheritance we might expect it should have include all his brethren for we may well suppose adam from whom the world be to be people have by this time that these be grow up to be men more sons than these two whereas abel himself be not so much as name and the word in the original can scarce with any good construction be apply to him it be too much to build a doctrine of so mighty consequence upon so doubtful and obscure a place of scripture which may well nay better be understand in a quite different sense and so can be but an ill proof be as doubtful as the thing to be prove by it especially when there be nothing else in scripture or reason to be find that favour or support it it follow p accordingly when jacob buy his brothers birthright isaac bless him thus be lord over thy brethren and let the sons of thy mother bow before thee another instance take it bring by our author to evince dominion due to birthright and an admirable one it be for it must be no ordinary way of reason in a man that be plead for the natural power of kings and against all compact to bring for proof of it an example where his own account of it found all the right upon compact and settle empire in the younger brother unless buy and sell be no compact for he tell us when jacob buy his birthright but pass by that let us consider the history itself with what use our author make of it and we shall find the follow mistake about it that our author report this as if isaac give jacob this bless immediately upon his purchase the birthright for he say when jacob buy isaac bless him which be plainly otherwise in the scripture for it appear there be a distance of time between and if we will take the story in the order it lie it must be no small distance all isaacs sojourn in gerar and transactions with abimelech gen xxvi come between rebecca be then beautiful and consequently young but isaac when he bless jacob be old and decrepit and esau also complain of jacob gen xxvii that two time he have supplant him he take away my birthrigllt say he and behold now he hath take away my bless word that i think signify distance of time and difference of action another mistake of our author be that he suppose isaac give jacob the bless and bid him be lord over his brethren because he have the birthright for our author bring this example to prove that he that have the birthright have thereby a right to be lord over his brethren but it be also manifest by the text that isaac have no consideration of jacobs have buy the birthright for when he bless him he consider him not as jacob but take him for esau nor do esau understand any such connexion between birthright and the bless for he say he hath supplant me these two time he take away my birthright and behold now he hath take away my bless whereas have the bless which be to be lord over his brethren belong to the birthright esau could not have complain of this second as a cheat jacob have get nothing but what esau have sell him when he sell him his birthright so that it be plain dominion if these word signify it be not understand to belong to the birthright and that in those days of the patriarchs dominion be not understand to be the right of the heir but only a greater portion of goods be plain from gen xxi for sarah take isaac to be heir say cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son whereby could be mean nothing but that he should not have a presence to an equal share of his father estate after his death but should have his portion presently and be go accordingly we read gen xxv that abraham give all that he have unto isaac but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham have abraham give gift and send them away from isaac his son while he yet live that be abraham have give portion to all his other sons and send them away that which he have reserve be the greatest part of his substance isaac as heir possess after his death but by be heir he have no right to be lord over his children for if he have why should sarah endeavour to rob him of one of his subject or lessen the number of his slave by desire to have ishmael send away thus as under the law the privilege of birthright be nothing but a double portion so we see that before moses in the patriarchs time from whence our author pretend to take his model there vas no knowledge no think that birthright give rule or empire paternal or kingly authority to any one over his brethren if this be not plain enough in the story of isaac and ishmael he that will look into chron v may there read these word reuben as the firstborn but forasmuch as he defile his father bed his birthright be give unto the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy be not to be reckon after the birthright for judah prevail above his brethren and of him come the chief ruler but the birthright be josephs what this birthright be jacob bless joseph gen xlviii telleth us in these word moreover i have give thee one portion above thy brethren which i take out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow whereby it be not only plain that the birthright be nothing but a double portion but the text in chronicle be express against our author doctrine and show that dominion be no part of the birthright for it tell us that joseph the birthright but judah the dominion one would think our author be very fond of the very name of birthright when he bring this instance of jacob and esau to prove that dominion belong to the heir over his brethren because it will be but an ill example to prove that dominion by gods ordination belong to the eldest son because jacob the youngest here have it let him come by it how he would for if it prove any thing it can only prove against our author that the assignment of dominion to the eldest be not by divine institution which would then be unalterable for if by the law of god or nature absolute power and empire belong to the eldest son and his heirs so that they be supreme monarchs and all the rest of their brethren slave our author give us reason to doubt whether the eldest son have a popover to part with it to the prejudice of his posterity since he tell us o that in grant and gift that have their original from god or nature no inferior power of man can limit or make any law of prescription against them because this place gen xxvii bring by our author concern not at all the dominion of one brother over the other nor the subjection of esau to jacob for it be plain in history that esau be never subject to jacob but live apart in mount seir where he found a distinct people and government and be himself prince over them as much as jacob be in his own family the text if consider can never be understand of esau himself or the personal dominion of jacob over him for the word brethren and sons of thy mother could not be use literally by isaac who know jacob have only one brother and these word be so far from be true in a literal sense or establish any dominion in jacob over esau that in the story we find the quite contrary for gen xxxii jacob several time call esau lord and himself his servant and gen xxxiii he bow himself seven time to the grind to esau whether esau then be a subject and vassal my as our author tell us all subject be slave to jacob and jacob his sovereign prince by birthright i leave the reader to judge and to believe if he can that these word of isaac be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother sons bow down to thee confirm jacob in a sovereignty over esau upon the account of the birthright he have get from him he that read the story of jacob and esau will find there never be any jurisdiction or authority that either of them have over the other after their father death they live with the friendship and equality of brethren neither lord neither slave to his brother but independent of each other be both head of their distinct families where they receive no laws from one another but live separately and be the root out of which spring two distinct people under two distinct governments this bless then of isaac whereon our author would build the dominion of the elder brother signify no more but what rebecca have be tell from god gen xxv two nations be in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separate from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger and so jacob bless judah gen xlix and give him the sceptre and dominion from whence our author might have argue as well that jurisdiction and dominion belong to the third son over his brethren as well as from this bless of isaac that it belong to jacob both these place contain only predictions of what should long after happen to their posterities and not any declaration of the right of inheritance to dominion in either and thus we have our author two great and only arguments to prove that heirs be lord over their brethren because god tell cain gen iv that however sin might set upon him he ought or might be master of it for the most learn interpreters understand the word of sin and not of abel anal give so strong reason for it that nothing can convincingly be infer from so doubtful a text to our author purpose because in this of gen xxvii isaac foretell that the israelites the posterity of jacob should have dominion over the edomites the posterity of esau therefore say our authorheirs be lord of their brethren i leave any one to judge of the conclusion and now we see our author have provide for the descend and conveyance down of adams monarchical power or paternal dominion to posterity by the inheritance of his heir succeed to all his father authority and become upon his death as much lord as his father be not only over his own children but over his brethren and all descend from his father and so in infinitum but yet who this heir be he do not once tell us and all the light we have from him in this so fundamental a point be only that in his instance of jacob by use the word birthright as that which pass from esau to jacob he leave us to guess that by heir he mean the eldest son though i do not remember he any where mention expressly the title of the firstborn but all along keep himself under the shelter of the indefinite term heir but take it to be have mean that the eldest son be heir for if the eldest be not there will be no presence why the sons should not be all heirs alike and so by right of primogeniture have dominion over his brethren this be but one step towards the settlement of succession and the difficulties remain still as much as ever till he can show us who be mean by right heir in all those case which may happen where the present possessor hath no son this he silently pass over and perhaps wisely too for what can be wiser after one have affirm that the person have that power as well as the power and form of government be the ordinance of god and by divine institution viz o p than to be careful not to start any question concern the person the resolution whereof will certainly lead him into a confession that god and nature hath determine nothing about him and if our author can not show who by right of nature or a clear positive law of god have the next right to inherit the dominion of this natural monarch he have be at such pain about when he die without a son he might have spar his pain in all the rest it be more necessary for the settle mens consciences and determine their subjection and allegiance to show them who by original right superior and antecedent to the will or any act of men hath a title to this paternal jurisdiction than it be to show that by nature there be such a jurisdiction it be to no purpose for me to know there be such a paternal power which i ought and be disposal to obey unless where there be many pretenders i also know the person that be rightfully in vest and endow with it for the main matter in question be concern the duty of my obedience and the obligation of conscience i be under to pay it to him that be of right my lord and ruler i must know the person that this right of paternal power reside in and so empower him to claim obedience from me for let it be true what he say p that civil power not only in general be by divine institution but even the assignment of it specially to the eldest parent and o that not only the power or right of government but the form of the power of govern and the person have that power be all the ordinance of god yet unless he show us in all case who be this person ordain by god who be this eldest parent all his abstract notions of monarchical power will signify just nothing when they be to be reduce to practice and men be conscientiously to pay their obedience for paternal jurisdiction be not the thing to be obey because it can not command but be only that which give one man a right which another hath not and if it come by inheritance another man can not have to command and be obey it be ridiculous to say i pay obedience to the paternal power when i obey him to whom paternal power give no right to my obedience for he can have no divine right to my obedience who can not show his divine right to the power of rule over me as well as that by divine right there be such a power in the world and hence not be able to make out any princes title to government as heir to adam which therefore be of no use and have be better let alone he be fain to resolve all into present possession and make civil obedience as due to an usurper as to a lawful king and thereby the usurpers title as good his word be o and they deserve to be remember if an usurper dispossess the true heir the subject obedience to the fatherly popover must go along and wait upon gods providence but i shall leave his title of usurpers to be examine in its due place and desire my sober reader to consider what thank princes owe such politics as this which can suppose paternal popover ie a right to government in the hand of a cade or a cromwell and so all obedience be due to paternal power the obedience of subject will be due to them by the same right and upon as good ground as it be to lawful princes and yet this as dangerous a doctrine as it be must necessarily follow from make all political power to be nothing else but adams paternal power by right and divine institution descend from him without be able to show to whom it descend or who be heir to it to settle government in the world and to lay obligations to obedience on any man conscience it be as necessary suppose with our author that all power be nothing but the be possess of adams fatherhood to satisfy him who have a right to this power this fatherhood when the possessor die without sons to succeed immediately to it as it be to tell him that upon the death of the father the eldest son have a right to it for it be still to be remember that the great question be and that which our author would be think to contend for if he do not sometimes forget it what persons have a right to be obey and not whether there be a power in the world which be to be call paternal without know in whom it reside for so it be a popover ie right to govern it matter not whether it be term paternal or regal natural or acquire whether you call it supreme fatherhood or supreme brotherhood will be all one provide we know who have it i go on then to ask whether in the inherit of this paternal power this supreme fatherhood the grandson by a daughter hath a right before a nephew by a brother whether the grandson by the eldest son be an infant before the younger son a man and able whether the daughter before the uncle or any other man descend by a male line whether a grandson by a younger daughter before a granddaughter by an elder daughter whether the elder son by a concubine before a younger son by a wife from whence also will arise many question of legitimation and what in nature be the difference betwixt a wife and a concubine for as to the municipal or positive laws of men they can signify nothing here it may farther be ask whether the eldest son be a fool shall inherit this paternal power before the younger a wise man and what degree of folly it must be that shall exclude him and who shall be judge of it whether the son of a fool exclude for his folly before the son of his wise brother who reign who have the paternal power whilst the widowqueen be with child by the decease king and nobody know whether it will be a son or a daughter which shall be heir of the two male twin who by the dissection of the mother be lay open to the world whether a sister by the halfblood before a brothers daughter by the whole blood these and many more such doubt might be propose about the title of succession and the right of inheritance and that not as idle speculations but such as in history we shall find have concern the inheritance of crown and kingdoms and if ours want them we need not go farther for famous examples of it than the other kingdom in this very island which have be fully relate by the ingenious and learn author of patriarcha non monarcha i need say no more of till our author hath resolve all the doubt that mall arise about the next heir and show that they be plainly determine by the law of nature or the reveal law of god all his suppositions of a monarchical absolute supreme paternal power in adam and the descent of that power to his heirs would not be of the least use to establish the authority or make out the title of any one prince now on earth but would rather unsettle and bring all into question for let our author tell us as long as he please and let all men believe it too that adam have a paternal and thereby a monarchical power that this the only power in the world descend to his heirs and that there be no other power in the world but this lot this be all as clear demonstration as it be manifest error yet if it be not past doubt to whom this paternal power descend and whose now it be nobody can be under any obligation of obedience unless any one will say that i be bind to pay obedience to paternal power in a man who have no more paternal power than i myself which be all one as to say i obey a man because he have a right to govern and if i be ask how i know he have a right to govern i should answer it can not be know that he have any at all for that can not be the reason of my obedience which i know not to be so much less can that be a reason of my obedience which nobody at all can know to be so and therefore all this ado about adams fatherhood the greatness of its power and the necessity of its supposal help nothing to establish the power of those that govern or to determine the obedience of subject who be to obey if they can not tell whom they be to obey or it can not be know who be to govern and who to obey in the state the world be now it be irrecoverably ignorant who be adams heir this fatherhood this monarchical power of adam descend to his heirs would be of no more use to the government of mankind than it would be to the quiet of men s consciences or secure their healths if our author have assure them that adam have a power to forgive sin or cure diseases which by divine institution descend to his heir whilst this heir be impossible to be know and should not he do as rationally who upon this assurance of our author go and confess his sin and expect a good absolution or take physic with expectation of health from any one who have take on himself the name of priest or physician or thrust himself into those employments say i acquiesce in the absolve power descend from adam or i shall be cure by the medicinal power descend from adam as he who say i submit to and obey the paternal lower descend from adam when it be confess all these power descend only to his single heir and that heir be unknown it be true the civil lawyers have pretend to determine some of these case concern the succession of princes but by our author principles they have meddle in a matter that belong not to them for if all political power be derive only from adam and be to descend only to his successive heirs by the ordinance of god and divine institution this be a right antecedent and paramount to all government and therefore the positive laws of men can not determine that which be itself the foundation of all law and government and be to receive its rule only from the law of god and nature and that be silent in the case i be apt to think there be no such right to be convey this way i be sure it would be to no purpose if there be and men would be more at a loss concern government and obedience to governors than if there be no such right since by positive laws and compact which divine institution if there be any shut out all these endless inextricable doubt can be safely provide against but it can never be understand how a divine natural right and that of such moment as be all order and peace in the world should be convey down to posterity without any plain natural or divine rule concern it and there would be an end of all civil government if the assignment of civil power be by divine institution to the heir and yet by that divine institution the person of the heir could not be know this paternal regal power be by divine right only his it leave no room for human prudence or consent to place it any where else for if only one man hath a divine right to the obedience of mankind nobody curl claim bleat obedience but he that can show that right nor can mens consciences by any other presence he oblige to it and thus this doctrine cut up all government by the root thus we see how our author lay it for a sure foundation that the very person that be to rule be the ordinance of god and by divine institution tell us at large only that this person be the heir but who this heir be he leave us to guess and so this divine institution which assign it to a person whom vie have no rule to know be just as good as an assignment to nobody at all but whatever our author do divine institution make no such ridiculous assignments nor can god be suppose to make it a sacred law that one certain person should have a right to something and yet not give rule to mark out and know that person by or give an heir a divine right to power and yet not point out who that heir be it be rather to be think that an heir have no such right by divine institution than that god should give such a right to the heir but yet leave it doubtful and undeterminable who such heir be if god lead give the land of canaan to abraham and in general term to somebody after him without name his seed whereby it might be know who that somebody be it would have be as good and useful an assignment to determine the right to the land of canaan as it would be the determine the right of crown to give empire to adam and his successive heirs after him without tell who his heir be for the word heir without a rule to know who it be signify no more than somebody i know not whom god make it a divine institution that men should not marry those who be of near kin think it not enough to say none of you shall approach to any that be near of kin to him to uncover albeit nakedness but moreover give rule to know who be those near of kin forbid by divine institution or else that law would have be of no use it be to no purpose to lay restraint or give privilege to men in such general term as the particular person concern can not be know by but god not have any where say the next heir shall inherit all his father estate or dominion we be not to wonder that he hath nowhere appoint who that heir should be for never have intend any such thing never design any heir in that sense we can not expect he should any where nominate or appoint any person to it as we might have it be otherwise and therefore in scripture though the word heir occur yet there be no such thing as heir in our author sense one that be by right of nature to inherit all that his father have exclusive of his brethren hence sarah suppose that if ishmael staid in the house to share in abrahams estate after his death this son of a bondwoman might be heir with isaac and therefore say she cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son but this can not excuse our author who tell us there be in every number of men one who be right and next heir to adam ought to have tell us what the laws of den scent be but he have be so spar to instruct us by rule how to know who be heir let us see in the next place what his history out of scripture on which he pretend wholly to build his government give us in this necessary and fundamental point our author to make good the title of his look p begin his history of the descent of adams regal power p in these word this lordship which adam by command have over the whole world and by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy be a large c how do he prove that the patriarchs by descent do enjoy it for dominion of life and deaths say he we find judah the father pronounce sentence of death against thamar his daughterinlaw for play the harlot p how do this prove that judah have absolute and sovereign authority he pronounce sentence of death the pronounce of sentence of death be not a certain mark of sovereignty but usually the office of inferior magistrates the power of make laws of life and death be indeed a mark of sovereignty but pronounce the sentence accord to those laws may be do by others and therefore this will but ill prove that he have sovereign authority as if one should say judge jefferies pronounce sentence of death in the late time therefore judge jefferies have sovereign authority but it will be say judah do it not by commission from another and therefore do it in his own right who know whether he have any right at all heat of passion might carry him to do that which he have no authority to do judah have dominion of life and death how do that appear he exercise it he pronounce sentence of death against thamar our author think it be very good proof that because he do it therefore he have a right to do it he lay with her also by the same way of proof he have a right to do that too if the consequence be good from do to a right of do absalom too may be reckon amongst our author sovereigns for he pronounce such a sentence of death against his brother amnon and much upon a like occasion and have it execute too if that be sufficient to prove a dominion of life and death but allow this all to be clear demonstration of sovereign power who be it that have this lordship by right descend to him from adam as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch judah say our author judah a younger son of jacob his father and elder brethren live so that if our author own proof be to be take a younger brother may in the life of his father and elder brothers by right of descent enjoy adams monarchical power and if one so qualify may be a monarch by descent why may not every man if judah his father and elder brethren live be one of adams heirs i know not who can be exclude from this inheritance all men by inheritance may be monarchs as well as judah touch war we see that abraham command an army of soldier of his own family and esau meet his brother jacob with men at arm for matter of peace abraham make a league with abimelech c p be it not possible for a man to have men in his family without be heir to adam a planter in the west indies have more and might if he please who doubt muster them up and lead them out against the indians to seek reparation upon any injury receive from them and an this without the absolute dominion of a monarch descend to him from adam would it not be an admirable argument to prove that all power by gods institution descend from adam by inheritance and that the very person and power of this planter be the ordinance of god because he have power in his family over servants bear in his house and buy with his money for this be just abrahams case those who be rich in the patriarchs days as in the west indies now buy men and maidservants and by their increase as well as purchase of new come to have large and numerous families which though they make use of in war or peace can it be think the power they have over them be an inheritance descend from adam when it be the purchase of their money a man rid in an expedition against an enemy his horse buy in a fair would be as good a proof that the owner enjoy the lordship which adam by command have over the whole world by right descend to him as abrahams lead out the servants of his family be that the patriarchs enjoy this lordship by descent from adam since the title to the power the master have in both case whether over slave or horse be only from his purchase and the get a dominion over any thing by bargain and money be a new way of prove one have it by descent and inheritance but make war and peace be mark of sovereignty let it be so in politic societies may not therefore a man in the west indies who hath with him sons of his own friends or companion soldier under pay or slave buy with money or perhaps a band make up of all these make war and peace if there should be occasion and ratify the article too with an oath without be a sovereign an absolute king over those who go with him he that say he can not must then allow many master of ship many private planters to be absolute monarchs for as much as this they have do war and peace can not be make for politic societies but by the supreme power of such societies because war and peace give a different motion to the force of such a politic body none can make war or peace but that which have the direction of the force of the whole body and that in politic societies be only the supreme power in voluntary societies for the time he that have such a power by consent may make war and peace and so may a single man for himself the state of war not consist in the number of partisans but the enmity of the party where they have no superior to appeal to the actual make of war or peace be no proof of any other power but only of dispose those to exercise or cease act of enmity for whom he make it and this power in many case any one may have without any politic supremacy and therefore the make of war or peace will not prove that every one that do so be a politic ruler much less a king for then commonwealths must be kings too for they do as certainly make war and peace as monarchical government but grant this a mark of sovereignty in abraham be it a proof of the descent to him of adams sovereignty over the whole world if it be it will surely be as good a proof of the descent of adams lordship to others too and then commonwealths as well as abraham will be heirs of adam for they make war and peace as well as he if you say that the lordship of adam doth not by right descend to commonwealths though they male war and peace the same say i of abraham and then there be an end of your argument if you stand to your argument and say those that do make war and peace as commonwealths do without doubt do inherit adams lordship there be an end of your monarchy unless you will say that commonwealths by descent enjoy adams lordship be monarchies and that indeed would be a new way of make all the governments in the world monarchical to give our author the honour of this new invention for i confess it be not i have first find it out by trace his principles and so charge it on him it be fit my readers know that as absurd as it may seem he teach it himself p where he ingenuously say in all kingdoms and commonwealths in the world whether the prince be the supreme father of the people or but the true heir to such a father or come to the crown by usurpation or election or whether some few or a multitude govern the commonwealth yet still the authority that be in any one or in many or in all these be the only right and natural authority of a supreme father which right of fatherhood he often tell us be regal and royal authority as particularly p the page immediately precede this instance of abraham this regal authority he say those that govern commonwealths have and if it be true that regal and royal authority be in those that govern commonwealths it be as true that commonwealths be govern by kings for if regal authority be in him that govern he that govern must need be a king and so all common wealths be nothing but downright monarchies and then what need any more ado about the matter the governments of the world be as they should be there be nothing but monarchy in it this without doubt be the surest way our author could have find to turn all other governments but monarchical out of the world but all this scarce prove abraham to have be a king as heir to adam if by inheritance he kind be king lot who be of the same family must need have be his subject by that title before the servants in his family but we see they live as friends and equal and when their herdsmen could not agree there be no presence of jurisdiction or superiority between them but they part by consent gen xiii hence he be call both by abraham and by the text abrahams brother the name of friendship and equality and not of jurisdiction and authority though he be really but his nephew and if our author know that abraham be adams heir and a king it be more it seem than abraham himself know or his servant whom he send a woo for his son for when he set out the advantage of the match gen xxiv thereby to prevail with the young woman and her friends he say i be abrahams servant and the lord hath bless my master greatly and he be become great and he hath give him flock and herd and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses and sarah my master wife bare a son to my master when she be old and unto him hath he give all he hath can one think that a discreet servant that be thus particular to set out his master greatness would have omit the crown isaac be to have if he have know of any such can it be imagine he should have neglect to have tell them on such an occasion as this that abraham be a king a name well know at that time for he have nine of them his neighbour if he or his master have think any such thing the likeliest matter of all the rest to make his errand successful but this discovery it seem be reserve for our author to make two or years after and let him enjoy the credit of it only he should have take care that some of adams land should have descend to this his heir as well as all adams lordship for though this lordship which abraham if we may believe our author as well as the other patriarchs by right descend to him do enjoy be as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch which hath be since the creation yet his estate his territories his dominions be very narrow and scanty for he have not the possession of a foot of land till he buy a field and a cave of the sons of heth to bury sarah in the instance of esau join with this of abraham to prove that the lordship which adam have over the whole world by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy be yet more pleasant than the former esau meet his brother jacob with men at arm he therefore be a king by right of heir to adam four hundred arm men then however get together be enough to prove him that lead them to be a king and adams heir there have be tories in ireland whatever there be in other countries who would have thank our author for so honourable an opinion of them especially if there have be nobody near with a better title of arm men to question their royal authority of it be a shame for men to trifle so to say no worse of it in so serious an argument here esau be bring as a proof that adams lordship adams absolute dominion as large as that of any monarch descend by right to the patriarchs and in this very chap p jacob be bring as an instance of one that by birthright be lord over his brethren so we have here two brothers absolute monarchs by the same title and at the same time heirs to adam the eldest heir to adam because he meet his brother with men and the youngest heir to adam by birth right esau enjoy the lordship which adam have over the whole world by right descend to him in as large and ample manner as the absolutest dominion of any monarch and at the same time jacob lord over him by the right heirs have to be lord over their brethren risum teneatis i never i confess meet with any man of part so dexterous as sir robert at this way of argue but it w as his misfortune to light upon an hypothesis that could not be accommodate to the nature of things and human affairs his principles could not be make to agree with that constitution and order which god lead settle in the world and therefore must need often clash with common sense and experience in the next section he tell us this patriarchal power continue not only till the flood but after it as the name patriarch cloth in part prove the word patriarch cloth more than in part prove that patriarchal power continue in the world as long as there be patriarchs for it be necessary that patriarchal power should be whilst there be patriarchs as it be necessary there should be paternal or conjugal power whilst there be father or husband but this be but play with name that which he would fallaciously insinuate be the thing in question to be prove viz that the lordship which adam have over the world the suppose absolute universal dominion of adam by right descend from him the patriarchs do enjoy if he affirm such an absolute monarchy continue to the flood in the world i would be glad to know what record he have it from for i confess i can not find a word of it in my bible if by patriarchal power he mean any thing else it be nothing to the matter in hand and how the name patriarch in some part prove that those who be call by that name have absolute monarchical power i confess i do not see and therefore i think need no answer till the argument from it be make out a little clearer the three sons of noah have the world say our author divide amongst them by their father for of them be the whole world overspread p the world might be overspread by the offspring of noahs sons though he never divide the world amongst them for the earth might be replenish without be divide so that all our author argument here prove no such division however i allow it to him and then ask the world be divide amongst them which of the three be adams heir if adams lordship adams monarchy by right descend only to the eldest then the other two could be but his subject his slave if by right it descend to all three brothers by the same right it will descend to all mankind and then it will be impossible what he say p that heirs be lord of their brethren should be true but all brothers and consequently all men will be equal and independent all heirs to adams monarchy and consequently all monarchs too one as much as another but it will be say noah their father divide the world amongst them so that our author will allow more to noah than he will to god almighty for o he think it hard that god himself should give the world to noah and his sons to the prejudice of noahs birthright his word be noah be leave sole heir to the world why should it be think that god would disinherit him of his birthright and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children and yet he here think it fit that noah should disinherit shem of his birthright and divide the world betwixt him and his brethren so that his birthright when our author please must and when he please must not be sacred and inviolable if noah do divide the world between his sons and his assignment of dominions to them be good there be an end of divine institution all our author discourse of adams heir with whatsoever he build on it be quite out of doors the natural power of kings fall to the grind and then the form of the power govern and the person have that power will not be as he say they be o the ordinance of god but they will he ordinances of man for if the right of the heir be the ordinance of god a divine right no man father or not father can alter it if it be not a divine right it be only human depend on the will of man and so where human institution give it not the firstborn have no right at all above his brethren and men may put government into what hand and under what form they please he go on most of the civilest nations of the earth labour to fetch their original from some of the sons or nephews of noah p how many do most of the civilest nations amount to and who be they i fear the chinese a very great and civil people as well as several other people of the east west north and south trouble not themselves much about this matter all that believe the bible which i believe be our author most of the civilest nations must necessarily derive themselves from noah but for the rest of the world they think little of his sons or nephews but if the herald and antiquaries of all nations for it be these men generally that labour to find out the originals of nations or all the nations themselves stout labour to fetch their original from some of the sons or nephews of noah what would this be to prove that the lordship which adam have over the whole world by a right descend to the patriarchs whoever nations or race of men labour to fetch their original from may be conclude to be think by them men of renown famous to posterity for the greatness of their virtues and action but beyond these they look not nor consider who they be heirs to but look on them as such as raise themselves by their own virtue to a degree that would give lustre to those who in future age could pretend to derive themselves from them but if it be ogyges hercules brama tamerlain pharamond nay if jupiter and saturn be the name from whence divers race of men both ancient and modern have labour to derive their original will that prove that those men enjoy the lordship of adam by right descend to them if not this be but a flourish of our author to mislead his reader that in itself signify nothing to as much purpose be what he tell us p concern this division of the world that some say it be by lot and others that noah sail round the mediterranean in ten years and divide the world into asia afric and europe portion for his three sons america then it seem be leave to be his that could catch it why our author take such pain to prove the division of the world by noah to his sons and will not leave out an imagination though no better than a dream that he can find any where to favour it be hard to guess since such a division if it prove any thing must necessarily take away the title of adams heir unless three brothers can all together be heirs of adam and therefore the follow word howsoever the manner of this division be uncertain yet it be most certain the division be by families from noah and his children over which the parent be head and princes p if allow him to be true and of any force to prove that all the power in the world be nothing but the lordship of adams descend by right they will only prove that the father of the children be all heirs to this lordship of adam for if in those days cham and japhet and other parent besides the eldest son be head and princes over their families and have a right to divide the earth by families what hinder younger brothers be father of families from have the same right if cham and japhet be princes by right descend to them notwithstanding any title of heir in their eldest brother younger brothers by the same right descend to them be princes now and so all our author natural power of kings will reach no farther than their own children and no kingdom by this natural right can be bigger than a family for either this lordship of adam over the whole world by right descend only to the eldest son and then there can be but one heir as our author say p or else it by right descend to all the sons equally and then every father of a family will have it as well as the three sons of noah take which you will it destroy the present governments and kingdoms that be now in the world since whoever have this natural power of a king by right descend to him must have it either as our author tell us cain have it and be lord over his brethren and so be alone king of the whole world or else as he tell us here shem cham and japhet have it three brothers and so be only prince of his own family and all families independent one of another all the world must be only one empire by the right of the next heir or else every family be a distinct government of itself by the lordship of adams descend to parent of families and to this only tend all the proof he here give us of the descent of adams lordship for continue his story of this descent he say in the dispersion of babel we must certainly find the establishment of royal power throughout the kingdoms of the world p if you must find it pray do and you will help us to a new piece of history but you must show it us before we shall be bind to believe that regal power be establish in the world upon your principles for that regal power be establish in the kingdoms of the world i think nobody will dispute but that there should be kingdoms in the world whose several kings enjoy their crown by right descend to them from adam that we think not only apocryphal but also utterly impossible if our author have no better foundation for his monarchy than a supposition of what be do at the dispersion of babel the monarchy he erect thereon whose top be to reach to heaven to unite mankind will serve only to divide and scatter them as that tower do and instead of establish civil government and order in the world will produce nothing but effusion for he tell us the nations they be divide into be distinct families which have father for rulers over them whereby it appear that even in the confusion god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority by distribute the diversity of languages accord to the diversity of families p it would have be a hard matter for any one but our author to have find out so plainly in the text he here bring that all the nations in that dispersion be govern by father and that god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority the word of the text be these be the sons of shem after their families after their tongue in their land after their station and the same thing be say of cham and japhet after an enumeration of their posterities in all which there be not one word say of their governors or form of government of father or fatherly authority but our author who be very quicksighted to spy out fatherhood where nobody else could see any the least glimpse of it tell us positively their rulers be father and god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority and why because those of the same family speak the same language and so of necessity in the division keep together just as if one should argue thus hannibal in his army consist of divers nations keep those of the same language together therefore father be captain of each band and hannibal be careful of the fatherly authority or in people of carolina the english french scotch and welsh that be there plant themselves together and by them the country be divide in their land after their tongue after their families after their nations therefore care be take of the fatherly authority or because in many part of america every little tribe be a distinct people with a different language one should infer that therefore god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority or that therefore their rulers enjoy adams lordship by right descend to them though we know not who be their governors nor what their form of government but only that they be divide into little indepen dent societies speak different languages the scripture say not a word of their rulers or form of government but only give an account how mankind come to be divide into distinct languages and nations and therefore it be not to argue from the authority of scripture to tell us positively father be their rulers when the scripture say no such thing but to set up fancy in ones own brain when we confidently aver matter of fact where record be utterly silent upon a like grind ie none at all he say that they be not confuse multitudes without head and governors and at liberty to choose what governors or governments they please for i demand when mankind be all yet of one language all congregate in the plain of shinar be they then all under one monarch who enjoy else lordship of adam by right descend to him if they be not there be then no thoughts it be plain of adams heir no right to government know then upon that title no care take by god or man of adams fatherly authority if when mankind be but one people dwell altogether and be of one language and be upon build a city together and when it be plain they could not but know the right heir for shem live till isaacs time a long while after the division at babel if then i say they be not under the monarchical government of adams fatherhood by right descend to the heir it be plain there w as no regard have to the fatherhood no monarchy acknowledge due to adams heir no empire of shems in asia and consequently no such division of the world by noah as our author have talk of as far as we can conclude any thing from scripture in this matter it seem from this place that if they have any government it be rather a commonwealth than an absolute monarchy for the scripture tell us gen xi they say it be not a prince command the build of this city and tower it be not by the command of one monarch but by the consultation of many a free people let us build us a city they build it for themselves as free men not as slave for their lord and master that we be not scatter abroad have a city once build and fix habitations to settle our abodes and families this be the consultation and design of a people that be at liberty to part asunder but desire to keep in one body and could not have be either necessary or likely in men tie together under the government of one monarch who if they have be as our author tell us all slave under the absolute dominion of a monarch need not have take such care to hinder themselves from wander out of the reach of his dominion i demand whether this be not plainer in scripture than any thing of adams heir or fatherly authority but if be as god say gen xi one people they have one ruler one king by natural right absolute and supreme over them what care have god to preserve the paternal authority of the supreme fatherhood if on a sudden he suffer for so many our author talk of distinct nations to be erect out of it under distinct governors and at once to withdraw themselves from the obedience of their sovereign this be to intitle gods care how and to what we please can it be sense to say that god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority in those who have it not for if these be subject under a supreme prince what authority have they be it an instance of gods care to preserve the fatherly authority when he take away the true supreme fatherhood of the natural monarch can it be reason to say that god for the preservation of fatherly authority let several new governments with their governors start up who could not all have fatherly authority and be it not as much reason to say that god be careful to destroy fatherly authority when he supers one who be in possession of it to have his government tear in piece and share by several of his subject would it not be an argument just like this for monarchical government to say when any monarchy be shatter to piece and divide amongst revolt subject that god be careful to preserve monarchical popover by rend a settle empire into a multitude of little governments if any one will say that what happen in providence to be preserve god be careful to preserve as a thing therefore to be esteem by men as necessary or useful it be a peculiar propriety of speech which every one will not think fit to imitate but this i an sure be impossible to be either proper or true speak that shem for example for he be then alive should have fatherly authority or sovereignty by right of fatherhood over that one people at babel and that the next moment shem yet live others should have fatherly authority or sovereignty by right of fatherhood over the same people divide into so many distinct governments either these father actually be rulers just before the confusion and then they be not one people but that god himself say they be or else they be a commonwealth and then where be monarchy or else these father have fatherly authority but know it not strange that fatherly authority should be the only original of government amongst men and yet all mankind not know it and stranger yet that the confusion of tongue should reveal it to them all of a sudden that in an instant these should know that they have fatherly power and all others know that they be to obey it in them and every one know that particular fatherly authority to which he be a subject he that can think this argue from scripture may from thence make out what model of an utopia will best suit with his fancy or interest and this fatherhood thus dispose of will justify both a prince who claim an universal monarchy and his subject who be father of families shall quit subjection to him and canton his empire into less governments for themselves for it will always remain a doubt in which of these the fatherly authority reside till our outlook resolve us whether shem who be then alive or these new princes begin so many new empires in his dominions and over his subject have right to govern since our author tell us that both one and the other have fatherly which be supreme authority and be bring in by him as instance of those who do enjoy the lordships of adam by right descend to them which be as large and ample as the absolutest dominion of any monarch this at least be unavoidable that if god be careful to preserve the fatherly authority in the newerected nations it necessarily follow that he be as careful to destroy all pretences of adams heir since he take care and therefore do preserve the fatherly authority in so many at least that could not possibly be adams heirs when the right heir if god have ever ordain any such inheritance could not but be know shem then live and they be all one people nimrod be his next instance of enjoy this patriarchal power p but i know not for what reason our author seem a little unkind to him and say that he against right enlarge his empire by seize violently on the right of other lord of families these lord of families here revere call father of families in his account of the dispersion at babel but it matter not how they be call so we know who they be for this fatherly authority must be in them either as heirs to adam and so there could not be nor above one at once or else as natural parent over their children and so every father will have paternal authority over his children by the same right and in as large extent as those have and so be independent princes over their own offspring take his lord of families in this latter sense as it be hard to give those word any other sense in this place he give us a very pretty account of the original of monarchy in these follow word p and in this sense he may be say to be the author and founder of monarchy viz as against right seize violently on the right of father over their children which paternal authority if it be in them by right of nature for else how could those come by it nobody can take from them without their own consent and then i desire our author and his friends to consider how far this will concern other princes and whether it will not accord to his conclusion of that paragraph resolve all regal power of those whose dominions extend beyond their families either into tyranny and usurpation or election and consent of father of families which will differ very little from consent of the people all his instance in the next section p of the dukes of edom the nine kings in a little corner of asia in abrahams days the kings in canaan destroy by joshua and the care he take to prove that these be all sovereign princes and that every town in those days have a king be so many direct proof against him that it be not the lordship of adam by right descend to them that make kings for if they have hold their royalties by that title either there must have be but one sovereign over them all or else every father of a family have be as good a prince and have as good a claim to royalty as these for if all the sons of esau have each of them the younger as well as the eldest the right of fatherhood and so be sovereign princes after their father death the same right have their sons after them and so on to all posterity which will limit all the natural power of fatherhood only to be over the issue of their own body and their descendents which power of fatherhood die with the head of each family and make way for the like power of fatherhood to take place in each of his sons over their respective posterities whereby the power of fatherhood will be preserve indeed and be intelligible but will not be at all to our author purpose none of the instance he bring be proof of any power they have as heirs of adams paternal authority by the title of his fatherhood descend to them no nor of any power they have by virtue of their own for adams fatherhood be over all mankind it could descend to but one at once and from him to his right heir only and so there could by that title be but one king in the world at a time and by right of fatherhood not descend from adam it must be only as they themselves be father end so could be over none but their own posterity so that if those dukes of edom if abraham and the nine kings his neighbour if jacob and esau and the kings in canaan the kings mutilate by adonibeseck the kings that come to benhadad the kings of greece make war at troy be as our author contend all of them sovereign princes it be evident that kings derive their power from some other original than fatherhoodsince some of these have power over more than their own posterity and it be demonstration they could not be all heirs to adam for i challenge any man to make any presence to power by right of fatherhood either intelligible or possible in any one otherwise than either as adams heir or as progenitor over his own descendents naturally spring from him and if our author could show that any one of these princes of which he give us here so large a catalogue have his authority by either of these title i think i might yield him the cause though it be manifest they be all impertinent and directly contrary to what he bring them to prove viz that the lordship which adam have over the world by right descend to the patriarchs have tell us p that the patriarchal government continue in abraham isaac and jacob until the egyptian bondage p he tell us by manifest footsteps we may trace this paternal government unto the israelites come into egypt allure the exercise of the supreme patriarchal government be intermit because they be in subjection to a stronger prince what these footsteps be of paternal government in our author sense ie of absolute monarchical power descend from adam and exercise by right of fatherhood we have see that be for years no footsteps at all since in all that time he can not produce any one example of any person who claim or exercise regal authority by right of fatherhood or show any one who be a king be adams heir all that his proof amount to be only this that there be father patriarchs and kings in that age of the world but that the father and patriarchs have any absolute arbitrary power or by what title those kings have theirs and of what extent it be the scripture be wholly silent it be manifest by right of fatherhood they neither do nor could claim any title to dominion or empire to say that the exercise of supreme patriarchal government be intermit because they be in subjection to a stronger prince prove nothing but what i before suspect viz that patriarchal jurisdiction or government be a fallacious expression and do not in our author signify what he would yet insinuate by it paternal and regal power such an absolute sovereignty as he suppose be in adam for how can he say that patriarchal jurisdiction be intermit in egypt where there be a king under whose regal government the israelites be if patriarchal be absolute monarchical jurisdiction and if it be not but something else why do he make such ado about a power not in question and nothing to the purpose the exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction if patriarchal be regal be not intermit whilst the israelites be in egypt it be true the exercise of regal power be not then in the hand of any of the promise seed of abraham nor before neither that i know but what be that to the intermission of regal authority as descend from adam unless our author will have it that this choose line of abraham have the right of inheritance to adams lordship and then to what purpose be his instance of the rulers in whom the fatherly authority be preserve in the confusion at isabel why do he bring the princes sons of ishmael and the dukes of edom and join them with abraham isaac and jacob as examples of the exercise of true patriarchal government if the exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction be intermit in the world whenever the heirs of jacob have not supreme power i fear supreme patriarchal jurisdiction be not only intermit but from the time of the egyptian bondage quite lose in the world since it will be hard to find from that time downwards any one who exercise it as an inheritance descend to him from the patriarchs abraham isaac and jacob i imagine monarchical government would have serve his turn in the hand of pharaoh or any body one can not easily discover in all place what his discourse tend to as particularly in this place it be not obvious to guess what he drive at when he say the exercise of supreme patriarchal jurisdiction in egypt or how this serve to make out the descent of adams lordship to the patriarchs or any body else for i think he have be give us out of scripture proof and examples of monarchical government found on paternal authority descend from adam and not an history of the jews amongst whom yet we find no kings till many years after they be a people and when kings be their rulers there be not the least mention or room for a presence that they be heirs to adam or kings by paternal authority i expect talk so much as he do of scripture that he would have produce thence a series of monarchs whose title be clear to adams fatherhood and who as heirs to him own and exercise paternal jurisdiction over their subject and that this be the true patriarchal government whereas he neither prove thee the patriarchs be kings nor that either kings or patriarchs be heirs to adam or so much as pretend to it and one may as well prove that the patriarchs be all absolute monarchs that the power both of patriarchs and kings be only paternal and that this power descend to them from adam i say all these proposition may be as well prove by a confuse account of a multitude of little kinds in the westindies out of ferdinando soto or any of our late histories of the northern america or by our author kings of greece out of homer as by any thing he bring out of scripture in that multitude of kings he have reckon up and methinks he should have let homer and his war of troy alone since his great zeal to truth or monarchy carry him to such a pitch of transport against philosophers and poets that he tell us in his preface that there be too many in these days who please themselves in run after the opinions of philosophers and poets to find out such an original of government as might promise them some title to liberty to the great scandal of christianity and bring in of atheism and yet these heathens philosopher aristotle and poet homer be not reject by our zealous christian politician whenever they over any thing that seem to serve his turn whether to the great scandal of christianity and bring in of atheism let him look this i can not but observe in author who it be visible write not for truth how ready zeal for interest and party be to entitle christianity to their design and to charge atheism on those who will not without examine submit to their doctrines and blindly swallow their nonsense but to return to his scripture history our author farther tell us p that after the return of the israelites out of bondage god out of a special care of them choose moses and joshua successively to govern as princes in the place and stead of the supreme father if it be true that they return out of bondage it must be in a state of freedom and must imply that both before and after this bondage they be free unless our author will say that change of master be return out of bondage or that a slave return out of bondage when he be remove from one gaily to another if then they return out of bondage it be plain that in those days whatever our author in his preface say to the contrary there be a difference between a son a subject and a slave and that neither the patriarchs before nor their rulers after this egyptian bondage number their sons or subject amongst their possessions and dispose of them with as absolute a dominion as they do their other goods this be evident in jacob to whom reuben offer his two sons as pledge and judah be at last surety for benjamins safe return out of egypt which all have be vain superfluous and but a sort of mockery if jacob have have the same power over every one of his family as he have over his ox or his ass as an owner over his substance and the offer that reuben or judah make have be such a security for return of benjamin as if a man should take two lamb out of his lord flock and offer one as security that he will safely restore the other when they be out of this bondage what then god out of a special care of them the israelites it be well that once in his book he will allow god to have any care of the people for in other place he speak of mankind as if god have no care of any part of them but only of their monarchs and that the rest of the people the societies of men be make as so many herd of cattle only for the service use and pleasure of their princes choose moses and joshua successively to govern as princes a shrewd argument our author have find out to prove gods care of the fatherly authority and adams heirs that here as an expression of his care of his own people he choose those for princes over them that have not the least presence to either the persons choose be moses of the tribe of levi and joshua of the tribe of ephraim neither of which have any title of fatherhood but say our author they be in the place and stead of the supreme father if god have any where as plainly declare his choice of such father to be rulers as he do of moses and joshua we might believe moses and joshua be in their place and stead but that be the question in debate till that be better prove moses be choose by god to be ruler of his people will no more prove that government belong to adams heir or to the fatherhood than gods choose aaron of the tribe of levi to be priest will prove that the priesthood belong to adams heir or the prime father since god would choose aaron to be priest and moses ruler in israel though neither of those offices be settle on adams heir or the fatherhood our author go on and after them likewise for a time he raise up judge to defend his people in time of peril p this prove fatherly authority to be the original of government and that it descend from adam to his heirs just as well as what go before only here our author seem to confess that these judge who be all the governors they then have be only men of velour whom they make their general to defend them in time of peril and can not god raise up such men unless fatherhood have a title to government but say our author when god give the israelites kings he reestablish the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government p how do god reestablish it by a law a positive command we find no such thing our author mean then that when god give theta a king in give them a king he reestablish the right c to reestablish defacto the right of lineal succession to paternal government be to put a man in possession of that government which his father do enjoy and he by lineal succession have a right to for first if it be another government than what his ancestor have it be not succeed to an ancient right but begin a new one for if a prince should give a man besides his ancient patrimony which for some age his family have be disseised of an additional estate never before in the possession of his ancestors he could not be say to reestablish the right of lineal succession to any more than what have be formerly enjoy by his ancestors if therefore the power the kings of israel have be any thing more than isaac or jacob have it be not the reestablish in them the right of succession to a power but give them a new power however you please to call it paternal or not and whether isaac and jacob have the same power that the kings of israel have i desire any one by what have be above say to consider and i do not think he will find that either abraham isaac or jacob have any regal power at all next there can be no reestablishment of the prime and ancient right of lineal succession to any thing unless he that be put in possession of it have the right to succeed and be the true and next heir to him he succeed to can that be a reestablishment which begin in a new family or that the reestablishment of an ancient right of lineal succession when a crown be give to one who have no right of succession to it and who if the lineal succession have go on have be out of all possibility of presence to it saul the first king god give the israelites be of the tribe of benjamin be the ancient and prime right of lineal succession reestablish in him the next be david the youngest son of jesse of the posterity of judah jacobs third son be the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government reestablish in him or in solomon his younger son and successor in the throne or in jeroboam over the ten tribes or in athaliah a woman who reign six years an utter stranger to the royal blood if the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government be reestablish in any of these or their posterity the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government belong to younger brothers as well as elder and may be reestablish in any man live for whatever younger brothers by ancient and prime right of lineal succession may have as well as the elder that every man live may have a right to by lineal succession and sir robert as well as any other and so what a brave right of lineal succession to his paternal or regal government our author have reestablish for the secure the right and inheritance of crown where every one may have it let the world consider but say our author however p whensoever god make choice of any special person to be king he intend that the issue also should have benefit thereof as be comprehend sufficiently in the person of the father although the father be only name in the grant this yet will not help out succession for if as our author say the benefit of the grant be intend to the issue of the grantee this will not direct the succession since if god give any thing to a man and his issue in general the claim can not be to any one of that issue in particular every one that be of his race will have an equal right if it be say our author mean heir i believe our author be as will as any body to have use that word if it would have serve his turn but solomon who succeed david in the throne be no more his heir than jeroboam who succeed him in the government of the ten tribes be his issue our author have reason to avoid say that god intend it to the heirs when that would not hold in a succession which our author could not except against and so he have leave his succession as undetermined as if he have say nothing about it for if the regal power be give by god to a man and his issue as the land of canaan be to abraham and his seed must they not all have a title to it all share in it and one may as well say that by gods grant to abraham and his seed the land of canaan be to belong only to one of his seed exclusive of all others as by gods grant of dominion to a man and his issue this dominion be to belong in peculiar to one of his issue exclusive of all others but how will our author prove that whensoever god make choice of any special person to be a king he intend that the i suppose he mean his issue also should have benefit thereof have he so soon forget moses and joshua whom in this very section he say god out of a special care choose to govern as princes and the judge that god raise up have not these princes have the same authority of the supreme fatherhood the same power that the kings have and be specially choose by god himself should not their issue have the benefit of that choice as well as davids or solomons if these have the paternal authority put into their hand immediately by god why have not their issue the benefit of this grant in a succession to this power or if they have it as adams heirs why do not their heirs enjoy it after them by right descend to them for they could not be heirs to one another be the power the same and from the same original in moses joshua and the judge as it be in david and the kings and be it inheritable in one and not in the other if it be not paternal authority then gods own people be govern by those that have not paternal authority and those governors do well enough without it if it be paternal authority and god choose the persons that be to exercise it our author rule fail that whensoever god make choice of any person to be supreme ruler for i suppose the name king have no spell in it it be not the title but the power make the difference he intend that the issue also should have the benefit of it since from their come out of egypt to davids time years the issue be never so sufficiently comprehend in the person of the father as that any son after the death of his father succeed to the government amongst all those judge that judge israel if to avoid this it be say god always choose the person of the successor and so transfer the fatherly authority to him exclude his issue from succeed to it that be manifestly not so in the story of jephthah where he article with the people and they make him judge over them as be plain judg xi it be in vain then to say that whensoever god choose any special person to have the exercise of paternal authority for if that be not to be king i desire to know the difference between a king and one have the exercise of paternal authority he intend the issue also should have the benefit of it since we find the authority the judge have end with them and descend not to their issue and if the judge have not paternal authority i fear it will trouble our author or any of the friends to his principles to tell who have then the paternal authority that be the government and supreme power amongst the israelites and i suspect they must confess that the choose people of god continue a people several hundreds of years without any knowledge or think of this paternal authority or any appearance of monarchical government at all to be satisfy of this he need but read the story of the levite and the war thereupon with the benjamites in the three last chapters of judge and when he find that the levite appeal to the people for justice that it be the tribes and the congregation that debate resolve and direct all that be do on that occasion he must conclude either that god be not careful to preserve the fatherly authority amongst his own choose people or else that the fatherly authority may be preserve where there be no monarchical government if the latter then it will follow that though fatherly authority be ever so well prove yet it will not infer a necessity of monarchical government if the former it will seem very strange and improbable that god should ordain fatherly authority to be so sacred amongst the sons of men that there could be no power or government without it and yet that amongst us own people even whilst he be provide a government for them and therein prescribe rule to the several state and relations of men this great and fundamental one this most material and necessary of all the rest should he conceal and lie neglect for years after before i leave this i must ask flow our author know that whensoever god make choice of any special person to be king he intend that the issue should have the benefit thereof do god by the law of nature or revelation say so by the same law also he must say which of his issue must enjoy the crown in succession and so point out the heir or else leave his issue to divide or scramble for the government both mike absurd and such as will destroy the benefit of such grant to the issue when any such declaration of gods intention be produce it will be our duty to believe god intend it so but till that be do our author must show us some better warrant before we shall be oblige to receive lie as the authentic revealer of gods intentions the issue say our author be comprehend sufficiently in the person of the father although the father only be name in the grant and yet god when he give the land of canaan to abraham gen xiii think fit to put his seed into the grant too so the priesthood be give to aaron and his seed and the crown god give not only to david but his seed also and however our author assure us that god intend that the issue should have the benefit of it when he choose any person to be king yet we see that the kingdom which he give to saul without mention his seed after him never come to any of his issue and why when god choose a person to be king he should intend that his issue should have the benefit of it more than when he choose one to be judge in israel i would fain know a reason or why do a errant of fatherly authority to a king more comprehend the issue than when a like grant be make to a judge be paternal authority by right to descend to the issue of one and not of the other there will need some reason to be show of this difference more than the name when the thing give be the same fatherly authority and the manner of give it gods choice of the person the same too for i suppose our author when he say god raise up judge will by no mean allow they be choose by the people but since our author have so confidently assure us of the care of god to preserve the fatherhood and pretend to build all he say upon the authority of the scripture we may well expect that that people whose law constitution and history be chiefly contain in the scripture should furnish him with the clearest instance of gods care of preserve the fatherly authority in that people who it be agree he have a most peculiar care of let us see then what state this paternal authority or government be in amongst the jews from their begin to be a people it be omit by our author confession from their come into egypt till their return out of that bondage above years from thence till god give the israelites a king about years more our author give but a very slender account of it nor indeed all that time be there the least footsteps of paternal or regal government amongst them but then say our author god reestablish the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government what a lineal succession to paternal government be then establish we have already see i only now consider how long this last and that be to their captivity about years from thence to their destruction by the romans above years after the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to paternal government be again lose and they continue a people in the promise land without it so that of years that they be gods peculiar people they have hereditary kingly government amongst them not onethird of the time and of that time there be not the least footstep of one moment of paternal government nor the reestablishment of the ancient and prime right of lineal succession to it whether we suppose it to be derive as from its fountain from david saul abraham or which upon our author principles be the only true from adam note in grant and gift that have their original from god or nature as the power of the father hath no inferior power of man can limit nor shake any law of prescription against them obs the scripture teach that supreme power be originally in the father without any limitation obs of political power it have be show in the forego discourse firstly that adam have not either by natural right of fatherhood or by positive donation from god any such authority over his children nor dominion over the world as be pretend secondly that if he have his heirs yet have no right to it thirdly that if his heirs have there be no law of nature nor positive law of god that determine which be the right heir in all case that may arise the right of succession and consequently of bear rule could not have be certainly determine fourthly that if even that have be determine yet the knowledge of which be the eldest line of adams posterity be so long since utterly lose that in the race of mankind and families of the world there remain not to one above another the least pretence to be the eldest house and to have the right of inheritance all these promise have as i think be clearly make out it be impossible that the rulers now on earth should make any benefit or derive any the least shadow of authority from that which be hold to be the fountain of all power adams private dominion and paternal jurisdiction so that he that will not give just occasion to think that all government in the world be the product only of force and violence and that men live together by no other rule but that of beasts where the strongest carry it and so lay a foundation for perpetual disorder and mischief tumult sedition and rebellion things that the followers of that hypothesis so loudly cry out against must of necessity find out another rise of government another original of political power and another way of design and know the persons that have it than what concern the true original extent and end of civil government sir robert filmer hath teach us to this purpose i think it may not be amiss to set down what i take to be political power that the power of a magistrate over a subject may be distinguish from that of a father over his children a master over his servant a husband over his wife and a lord over his slave all which distinct power happen sometimes together in the same man if he be consider under these different relations it may help us to distinguish these power one from another and show the difference betwixt a ruler of a commonwealth a father of a family and a captain of a galley political power then i take to be a right of make laws with penalties of death and consequently all less penalties for the regulate and preserve of property and of employ the force of the community in the execution of such laws and in the defence of the commonwealth from foreign injury and all this only for the public good of the state of nature to understand political power aright and derive it from its original we must consider what estate all men be naturally in and that be a state of perfect freedom to order their action and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit within the bound of the law of nature without ask leave or depend upon the will of any other man a state also of equality wherein all the power and jurisdiction be reciprocal no one have more than another there be nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously bear to all the same advantage of nature and the use of the same faculties should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection unless the lord and master of them all should by any manifest declaration of his will set one above another and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty this equality of men by nature the judicious hooker look upon as so evident in itself and beyond all question that he make it the foundation of that obligation to mutual love amongst men on which he build the duties they owe one another and from whence he derive the great maxims of justice and charity his word be the like natural inducement hath bring men to know that it be no less their duty to love others than themselves for see those things which be equal must need all have one measure if i can not but wish to receive good even as much at every man hand as any man can wish unto his own soul how should i look to have any part of my desire herein satisfy unless myself be careful to satisfy the like desire which be undoubtedly in other men weak be of one and the same nature to have anything offer them repugnant to this desire must need in all respect grieve them as much as me so that if i do harm i must look to suffer there be no reason that others should show greater measure of love to me than they have by me show unto them my desire therefore to be love of my equal in nature as much as possible may be imposeth upon me a natural duty of bear to themward fully the like affection from which relation of equality between ourselves and them that be as ourselves what several rule and canons natural reason hath draw for direction of life no man be ignorant eccl pol i but though this be a state of liberty yet it be not a state of licence though man in that state have an uncontrollable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions yet he have not liberty to destroy himself or so much as any creature in his possession but where some nobler use than its bare preservation call for it the state of nature have a law of nature to govern it which oblige every one and reason which be that law teach all mankind who will but consult it that be all equal and independent no one ought to harm another in his life health liberty or possessions for men be all the workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise maker all the servants of one sovereign master send into the world by his order and about his business they be his property whose workmanship they be make to last during his not one anothers pleasure and be furnish with like faculties share all in one community of nature there can not be suppose any such subordination among us that may authorise us to destroy one another as if we be make for one anothers use as the inferior rank of creatures be for ours every one as he be bind to preserve himself and not to quit his station wilfully so by the like reason when his own preservation come not in competition ought he as much as he can to preserve the rest of mankind and not unless it be to do justice on an offender take away or impair the life or what tend to the preservation of the life the liberty health limb or goods of another and that all men may be restrain from invade others right and from do hurt to one another and the law of nature be observe which willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind the execution of the law of nature be in that state put into every man hand whereby every one have a right to punish the transgressors of that law to such a degree as may hinder its violation for the law of nature would as all other laws that concern men in this world be in vain if there be nobody that in the state of nature have a power to execute that law and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders and if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he have do every one may do so for in that state of perfect equality where naturally there be no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another what any may do in prosecution of that law every one must need have a right to do and thus in the state of nature one man come by a power over another but yet no absolute or arbitrary power to use a criminal when he have get him in his hand accord to the passionate heat or boundless extravagancy of his own will but only to retribute to him so far as calm reason and conscience dictate what be proportionate to his transgression which be so much as may serve for reparation and restraint for these two be the only reason why one man may lawfully do harm to another which be that we call punishment in transgress the law of nature the offender declare himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity which be that measure god have set to the action of men for their mutual security and so he become dangerous to mankind the tie which be to secure them from injury and violence be slight and break by him which be a trespass against the whole species and the peace and safety of it provide for by the law of nature every man upon this score by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general may restrain or where it be necessary destroy things noxious to them and so may bring such evil on any one who hath transgress that law as may make him repent the do of it and thereby deter him and by his example others from do the like mischief and in this case and upon this grind every man hath a right to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature i doubt not but this will seem a very strange doctrine to some men but before they condemn it i desire them to resolve me by what right any prince or state can put to death or punish an alien for any crime he commit in their country it be certain their laws by virtue of any sanction they receive from the promulgate will of the legislature reach not a stranger they speak not to him nor if they do be he bind to hearken to them the legislative authority by which they be in force over the subject of that commonwealth hath no power over him those who have the supreme power of make laws in england france or holland be to an indian but like the rest of the worldmen without authority and therefore if by the law of nature every man hath not a power to punish offences against it as he soberly judge the case to require i see not how the magistrates of any community can punish an alien of another country since in reference to him they can have no more power than what every man naturally may have over another besides the crime which consist in violate the laws and vary from the right rule of reason whereby a man so far become degenerate and declare himself to quit the principles of human nature and to be a noxious creature there be commonly injury do and some person or other some other man receive damage by his transgression in which case he who hath receive any damage have besides the right of punishment common to him with other men a particular right to seek reparation from him that hath do it and any other person who find it just may also join with him that be injure and assist him in recover from the offender so much as may make satisfaction for the harm he hath suffer from these two distinct right the one of punish the crime for restraint and prevent the like offence which right of punish be in everybody the other of take reparation which belong only to the injure party come it to pass that the magistrate who by be magistrate hath the common right of punish put into his hand can often where the public good demand not the execution of the law remit the punishment of criminal offences by his own authority but yet can not remit the satisfaction due to any private man for the damage he have receive that he who hath suffer the damage have a right to demand in his own name and he alone can remit the damnified person have this power of appropriate to himself the goods or service of the offender by right of selfpreservation as every man have a power to punish the crime to prevent its be commit again by the right he have of preserve all mankind and do all reasonable things he can in order to that end and thus it be that every man in the state of nature have a power to kill a murderer both to deter others from do the like injury which no reparation can compensate by the example of the punishment that attend it from everybody and also to secure men from the attempt of a criminal who have renounce reason the common rule and measure god hath give to mankind hath by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath commit upon one declare war against all mankind and therefore may be destroy as a lion or a tiger one of those wild savage beasts with whom men can have no society nor security and upon this be ground that great law of nature whoso sheddeth man blood by man shall his blood be shed and cain be so fully convince that every one have a right to destroy such a criminal that after the murder of his brother he cry out every one that findeth me shall slay me so plain be it writ in the hearts of all mankind by the same reason may a man in the state of nature punish the lesser breach of that law it will perhaps be demand with death i answer each transgression may be punish to that degree and with so much severity as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the offender give him cause to repent and terrify others from do the like every offence that can be commit in the state of nature may in the state of nature be also punish equally and as far forth as it may in a commonwealth for though it would be beside my present purpose to enter here into the particulars of the law of nature or its measure of punishment yet it be certain there be such a law and that too as intelligible and plain to a rational creature and a studier of that law as the positive laws of commonwealths nay possibly plainer as much as reason be easier to be understand than the fancy and intricate contrivances of men follow contrary and hide interest put into word for truly so be a great part of the municipal laws of countries which be only so far right as they be found on the law of nature by which they be to be regulate and interpret to this strange doctrineviz that in the state of nature every one have the executive power of the law of naturei doubt not but it will be object that it be unreasonable for men to be judge in their own case that selflove will make men partial to themselves and their friends and on the other side illnature passion and revenge will carry them too far in punish others and hence nothing but confusion and disorder will follow and that therefore god hath certainly appoint government to restrain the partiality and violence of men i easily grant that civil government be the proper remedy for the inconvenience of the state of nature which must certainly be great where men may be judge in their own case since it be easy to be imagine that he who be so unjust as to do his brother an injury will scarce be so just as to condemn himself for it but i shall desire those who make this objection to remember that absolute monarchs be but men and if government be to be the remedy of those evils which necessarily follow from men be judge in their own case and the state of nature be therefore not to be endure i desire to know what kind of government that be and how much better it be than the state of nature where one man command a multitude have the liberty to be judge in his own case and may do to all his subject whatever he please without the least question or control of those who execute his pleasure and in whatsoever he doth whether lead by reason mistake or passion must be submit to which men in the state of nature be not bind to do one to another and if he that judge judge amiss in his own or any other case he be answerable for it to the rest of mankind it be often ask as a mighty objection where be or ever be there any men in such a state of nature to which it may suffice as an answer at present that since all princes and rulers of independent governments all through the world be in a state of nature it be plain the world never be nor never will be without number of men in that state i have name all governors of independent communities whether they be or be not in league with others for it be not every compact that put an end to the state of nature between men but only this one of agree together mutually to enter into one community and make one body politic other promise and compact men may make one with another and yet still be in the state of nature the promise and bargain for truck etc between the two men in soldania in or between a swiss and an indian in the woods of america be bind to them though they be perfectly in a state of nature in reference to one another for truth and keep of faith belong to men as men and not as members of society to those that say there be never any men in the state of nature i will not oppose the authority of the judicious hooker eccl pol i where he say the laws which have be hitherto mention ie the laws of naturedo bind men absolutely even as they be men although they have never any settle fellowship never any solemn agreement amongst themselves what to do or not to do but for as much as we be not by ourselves sufficient to furnish ourselves with competent store of things needful for such a life as our nature doth desire a life fit for the dignity of man therefore to supply those defect and imperfections which be in us as live single and solely by ourselves we be naturally induce to seek communion and fellowship with others this be the cause of men unite themselves as first in politic societies but i moreover affirm that all men be naturally in that state and remain so till by their own consent they make themselves members of some politic society and i doubt not in the sequel of this discourse to make it very clear of the state of war the state of war be a state of enmity and destruction and therefore declare by word or action not a passionate and hasty but sedate settle design upon another man life put him in a state of war with him against whom he have declare such an intention and so have expose his life to the others power to be take away by him or any one that join with him in his defence and espouse his quarrel it be reasonable and just i should have a right to destroy that which threaten me with destruction for by the fundamental law of nature man be to be preserve as much as possible when all can not be preserve the safety of the innocent be to be prefer and one may destroy a man who make war upon him or have discover an enmity to his be for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion because they be not under the tie of the common law of reason have no other rule but that of force and violence and so may be treat as a beast of prey those dangerous and noxious creatures that will be sure to destroy him whenever he fall into their power and hence it be that he who attempt to get another man into his absolute power do thereby put himself into a state of war with him it be to be understand as a declaration of a design upon his life for i have reason to conclude that he who would get me into his power without my consent would use me as he please when he have get me there and destroy me too when he have a fancy to it for nobody can desire to have me in his absolute power unless it be to compel me by force to that which be against the right of my freedomie make me a slave to be free from such force be the only security of my preservation and reason bid me look on him as an enemy to my preservation who would take away that freedom which be the fence to it so that he who make an attempt to enslave me thereby put himself into a state of war with me he that in the state of nature would take away the freedom that belong to any one in that state must necessarily be suppose to have a design to take away everything else that freedom be the foundation of all the rest as he that in the state of society would take away the freedom belong to those of that society or commonwealth must be suppose to design to take away from them everything else and so be look on as in a state of war this make it lawful for a man to kill a thief who have not in the least hurt him nor declare any design upon his life any farther than by the use of force so to get him in his power as to take away his money or what he please from him because use force where he have no right to get me into his power let his pretence be what it will i have no reason to suppose that he who would take away my liberty would not when he have me in his power take away everything else and therefore it be lawful for me to treat him as one who have put himself into a state of war with meie kill him if i can for to that hazard do he justly expose himself whoever introduce a state of war and be aggressor in it and here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war which however some men have confound be as far distant as a state of peace goodwill mutual assistance and preservation and a state of enmity malice violence and mutual destruction be one from another men live together accord to reason without a common superior on earth with authority to judge between them be properly the state of nature but force or a declare design of force upon the person of another where there be no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief be the state of war and it be the want of such an appeal give a man the right of war even against an aggressor though he be in society and a fellowsubject thus a thief whom i can not harm but by appeal to the law for have steal all that i be worth i may kill when he set on me to rob me but of my horse or coat because the law which be make for my preservation where it can not interpose to secure my life from present force which if lose be capable of no reparation permit me my own defence and the right of war a liberty to kill the aggressor because the aggressor allow not time to appeal to our common judge nor the decision of the law for remedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable want of a common judge with authority put all men in a state of nature force without right upon a man person make a state of war both where there be and be not a common judge but when the actual force be over the state of war cease between those that be in society and be equally on both side subject to the judge and therefore in such controversies where the question be put who shall be judge it can not be mean who shall decide the controversy every one know what jephtha here tell us that the lord the judge shall judge where there be no judge on earth the appeal lie to god in heaven that question then can not mean who shall judge whether another hath put himself in a state of war with me and whether i may as jephtha do appeal to heaven in it of that i myself can only judge in my own conscience as i will answer it at the great day to the supreme judge of all men of slavery the natural liberty of man be to be free from any superior power on earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man but to have only the law of nature for his rule the liberty of man in society be to be under no other legislative power but that establish by consent in the commonwealth nor under the dominion of any will or restraint of any law but what that legislative shall enact accord to the trust put in it freedom then be not what sir robert filmer tell us a liberty for every one to do what he list to live as he please and not to be tie by any laws but freedom of men under government be to have a stand rule to live by common to every one of that society and make by the legislative power erect in it a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribe not not to be subject to the inconstant uncertain unknown arbitrary will of another man as freedom of nature be to be under no other restraint but the law of nature this freedom from absolute arbitrary power be so necessary to and closely join with a man preservation that he can not part with it but by what forfeit his preservation and life together for a man not have the power of his own life can not by compact or his own consent enslave himself to any one nor put himself under the absolute arbitrary power of another to take away his life when he please nobody can give more power than he have himself and he that can not take away his own life can not give another power over it indeed have by his fault forfeit his own life by some act that deserve death he to whom he have forfeit it may when he have him in his power delay to take it and make use of him to his own service and he do him no injury by it for whenever he find the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life it be in his power by resist the will of his master to draw on himself the death he desire this be the perfect condition of slavery which be nothing else but the state of war continue between a lawful conqueror and a captive for if once compact enter between them and make an agreement for a limit power on the one side and obedience on the other the state of war and slavery cease as long as the compact endure for as have be say no man can by agreement pass over to another that which he hath not in himselfa power over his own life i confess we find among the jews as well as other nations that men do sell themselves but it be plain this be only to drudgery not to slavery for it be evident the person sell be not under an absolute arbitrary despotical power for the master could not have power to kill him at any time whom at a certain time he be oblige to let go free out of his service and the master of such a servant be so far from have an arbitrary power over his life that he could not at pleasure so much as maim him but the loss of an eye or tooth set him free exod of property whether we consider natural reason which tell us that men be once bear have a right to their preservation and consequently to meat and drink and such other things as nature afford for their subsistence or revelation which give us an account of those grant god make of the world to adam and to noah and his sons it be very clear that god as king david say psalm have give the earth to the children of men give it to mankind in common but this be suppose it seem to some a very great difficulty how any one should ever come to have a property in anything i will not content myself to answer that if it be difficult to make out property upon a supposition that god give the world to adam and his posterity in common it be impossible that any man but one universal monarch should have any property upon a supposition that god give the world to adam and his heirs in succession exclusive of all the rest of his posterity but i shall endeavour to show how men might come to have a property in several part of that which god give to mankind in common and that without any express compact of all the commoners god who hath give the world to men in common hath also give them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life and convenience the earth and all that be therein be give to men for the support and comfort of their be and though all the fruit it naturally produce and beasts it feed belong to mankind in common as they be produce by the spontaneous hand of nature and nobody have originally a private dominion exclusive of the rest of mankind in any of them as they be thus in their natural state yet be give for the use of men there must of necessity be a mean to appropriate them some way or other before they can be of any use or at all beneficial to any particular men the fruit or venison which nourish the wild indian who know no enclosure and be still a tenant in common must be his and so his ie a part of him that another can no longer have any right to it before it can do him any good for the support of his life though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men yet every man have a property in his own person this nobody have any right to but himself the labour of his body and the work of his hand we may say be properly his whatsoever then he remove out of the state that nature hath provide and leave it in he hath mix his labour with it and join to it something that be his own and thereby make it his property it be by him remove from the common state nature place it in it hath by this labour something annex to it that exclude the common right of other men for this labour be the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can have a right to what that be once join to at least where there be enough and as good leave in common for others he that be nourish by the acorns he pick up under an oak or the apples he gather from the tree in the wood have certainly appropriate them to himself nobody can deny but the nourishment be his i ask then when do they begin to be his when he digest or when he eat or when he boil or when he bring them home or when he pick them up and it be plain if the first gather make them not his nothing else could that labour put a distinction between them and common that add something to them more than nature the common mother of all have do and so they become his private right and will any one say he have no right to those acorns or apples he thus appropriate because he have not the consent of all mankind to make them his be it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belong to all in common if such a consent as that be necessary man have starve notwithstanding the plenty god have give him we see in commons which remain so by compact that it be the take any part of what be common and remove it out of the state nature leave it in which begin the property without which the common be of no use and the take of this or that part do not depend on the express consent of all the commoners thus the grass my horse have bite the turf my servant have cut and the ore i have digged in any place where i have a right to them in common with others become my property without the assignation or consent of anybody the labour that be mine remove them out of that common state they be in hath fix my property in them by make an explicit consent of every commoner necessary to any ones appropriate to himself any part of what be give in common children or servants could not cut the meat which their father or master have provide for them in common without assign to every one his peculiar part though the water run in the fountain be every ones yet who can doubt but that in the pitcher be his only who draw it out his labour hath take it out of the hand of nature where it be common and belong equally to all her children and hath thereby appropriate it to himself thus this law of reason make the deer that indians who hath kill it it be allow to be his goods who hath bestow his labour upon it though before it be the common right of every one and amongst those who be count the civilise part of mankind who have make and multiply positive laws to determine property this original law of nature for the begin of property in what be before common still take place and by virtue thereof what fish any one catch in the ocean that great and still remain common of mankind or what ambergris any one take up here be by the labour that remove it out of that common state nature leave it in make his property who take that pain about it and even amongst us the hare that any one be hunt be think his who pursue her during the chase for be a beast that be still look upon as common and no man private possession whoever have employ so much labour about any of that kind as to find and pursue her have thereby remove her from the state of nature wherein she be common and hath begin a property it will perhaps be object to this that if gather the acorns or other fruit of the earth etc make a right to them then any one may engross as much as he will to which i answer not so the same law of nature that do by this mean give us property do also bind that property too god have give us all things richly be the voice of reason confirm by inspiration but how far have he give it usto enjoy as much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoil so much he may by his labour fix a property in whatever be beyond this be more than his share and belong to others nothing be make by god for man to spoil or destroy and thus consider the plenty of natural provision there be a long time in the world and the few spenders and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one man could extend itself and engross it to the prejudice of others especially keep within the bound set by reason of what might serve for his use there could be then little room for quarrel or contentions about property so establish but the chief matter of property be now not the fruit of the earth and the beasts that subsist on it but the earth itself as that which take in and carry with it all the rest i think it be plain that property in that too be acquire as the former as much land as a man till plant improve cultivate and can use the product of so much be his property he by his labour do as it be enclose it from the common nor will it invalidate his right to say everybody else have an equal title to it and therefore he can not appropriate he can not enclose without the consent of all his fellowcommoners all mankind god when he give the world in common to all mankind command man also to labour and the penury of his condition require it of him god and his reason command him to subdue the earthie improve it for the benefit of life and therein lay out something upon it that be his own his labour he that in obedience to this command of god subdue till and sow any part of it thereby annex to it something that be his property which another have no title to nor could without injury take from him nor be this appropriation of any parcel of land by improve it any prejudice to any other man since there be still enough and as good leave and more than the yet unprovided could use so that in effect there be never the less leave for others because of his enclosure for himself for he that leave as much as another can make use of do as good as take nothing at all nobody could think himself injure by the drink of another man though he take a good draught who have a whole river of the same water leave him to quench his thirst and the case of land and water where there be enough of both be perfectly the same god give the world to men in common but since he give it them for their benefit and the greatest conveniencies of life they be capable to draw from it it can not be suppose he mean it should always remain common and uncultivated he give it to the use of the industrious and rational and labour be to be his title to it not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious he that have as good leave for his improvement as be already take up need not complain ought not to meddle with what be already improve by anothers labour if he do it be plain he desire the benefit of anothers pain which he have no right to and not the grind which god have give him in common with others to labour on and whereof there be as good leave as that already possess and more than he know what to do with or his industry could reach to it be true in land that be common in england or any other country where there be plenty of people under government who have money and commerce no one can enclose or appropriate any part without the consent of all his fellowcommoners because this be leave common by compactie by the law of the land which be not to be violate and though it be common in respect of some men it be not so to all mankind but be the joint propriety of this country or this parish besides the remainder after such enclosure would not be as good to the rest of the commoners as the whole be when they could all make use of the whole whereas in the begin and first people of the great common of the world it be quite otherwise the law man be under be rather for appropriate god command and his want force him to labour that be his property which could not be take from him wherever he have fix it and hence subdue or cultivate the earth and have dominion we see be join together the one give title to the other so that god by command to subdue give authority so far to appropriate and the condition of human life which require labour and materials to work on necessarily introduce private possessions the measure of property nature well set by the extent of mens labour and the conveniency of life no man labour could subdue or appropriate all nor could his enjoyment consume more than a small part so that it be impossible for any man this way to entrench upon the right of another or acquire to himself a property to the prejudice of his neighbour who would still have room for as good and as large a possession after the other have take out his as before it be appropriate which measure do confine every man possession to a very moderate proportion and such as he might appropriate to himself without injury to anybody in the first age of the world when men be more in danger to be lose by wander from their company in the then vast wilderness of the earth than to be straiten for want of room to plant in the same measure may be allow still without prejudice to anybody full as the world seem for suppose a man or family in the state they be at first people of the world by the children of adam or noah let him plant in some inland vacant place of america we shall find that the possessions he could make himself upon the measure we have give would not be very large nor even to this day prejudice the rest of mankind or give them reason to complain or think themselves injure by this man encroachment though the race of men have now spread themselves to all the corner of the world and do infinitely exceed the small number be at the begin nay the extent of grind be of so little value without labour that i have hear it affirm that in spain itself a man may be permit to plough sow and reap without be disturb upon land he have no other title to but only his make use of it but on the contrary the inhabitants think themselves behold to him who by his industry on neglect and consequently waste land have increase the stock of corn which they want but be this as it will which i lay no stress on this i dare boldly affirm that the same rule of proprietyviz that every man should have as much as he could make use of would hold still in the world without straiten anybody since there be land enough in the world to suffice double the inhabitants have not the invention of money and the tacit agreement of men to put a value on it introduce by consent larger possessions and a right to them which how it have do i shall by and by show more at large this be certain that in the begin before the desire of have more than men need have alter the intrinsic value of things which depend only on their usefulness to the life of man or have agree that a little piece of yellow metal which would keep without waste or decay should be worth a great piece of flesh or a whole heap of corn though men have a right to appropriate by their labour each one to himself as much of the things of nature as he could use yet this could not be much nor to the prejudice of others where the same plenty be still leave to those who would use the same industry before the appropriation of land he who gather as much of the wild fruit kill catch or tame as many of the beasts as he could he that so employ his pain about any of the spontaneous products of nature as any way to alter them from the state nature put them in by place any of his labour on them do thereby acquire a propriety in them but if they perish in his possession without their due useif the fruit rot or the venison putrefy before he could spend it he offend against the common law of nature and be liable to be punish he invade his neighbour share for he have no right farther than his use call for any of them and they might serve to afford him conveniencies of life the same measure govern the possession of land too whatsoever he till and reap lay up and make use of before it spoil that be his peculiar right whatsoever he enclose and could fee and make use of the cattle and product be also his but if either the grass of his enclosure rot on the grind or the fruit of his plant perish without gather and lay up this part of the earth notwithstanding his enclosure be still to be look on as waste and might be the possession of any other thus at the begin cain might take as much grind as he could till and make it his own land and yet leave enough to abels sheep to fee on a few acres would serve for both their possessions but as families increase and industry enlarge their stock their possessions enlarge with the need of them but yet it be commonly without any fix property in the grind they make use of till they incorporate settle themselves together and build cities and then by consent they come in time to set out the bound of their distinct territories and agree on limit between them and their neighbour and by laws within themselves settle the properties of those of the same society for we see that in that part of the world which be first inhabit and therefore like to be best people even as low down as abrahams time they wander with their flock and their herd which be their substance freely up and downand this abraham do in a country where he be a stranger whence it be plain that at least a great part of the land lay in common that the inhabitants value it not nor claim property in any more than they make use of but when there be not room enough in the same place for their herd to fee together they by consent as abraham and lot do gen xiii separate and enlarge their pasture where it best like them and for the same reason esau go from his father and his brother and plant in mount seir gen and thus without suppose any private dominion and property in adam over all the world exclusive of all other men which can no way be prove nor any ones property be make out from it but suppose the world give as it be to the children of men in common we see how labour could make men distinct title to several parcel of it for their private use wherein there could be no doubt of right no room for quarrel nor be it so strange as perhaps before consideration it may appear that the property of labour should be able to overbalance the community of land for it be labour indeed that put the difference of value on everything and let any one consider what the difference be between an acre of land plant with tobacco or sugar sow with wheat or barley and an acre of the same land lie in common without any husbandry upon it and he will find that the improvement of labour make the far greater part of the value i think it will be but a very modest computation to say that of the products of the earth useful to the life of man ninetenths be the effect of labour nay if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use and cast up the several expense about themwhat in them be purely owe to nature and what to labourwe shall find that in most of them ninetynine hundredths be wholly to be put on the account of labour there can not be a clearer demonstration of anything than several nations of the americans be of this who be rich in land and poor in all the comfort of life whom nature have furnish as liberally as any other people with the materials of plentyie a fruitful soil apt to produce in abundance what might serve for food raiment and delight yet for want of improve it by labour have not one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy and a king of a large and fruitful territory there feed lodge and be clothe worse than a day labourer in england to make this a little clearer let us but trace some of the ordinary provision of life through their several progress before they come to our use and see how much they receive of their value from human industry bread wine and cloth be things of daily use and great plenty yet notwithstanding acorns water and leave or skin must be our bread drink and clothe do not labour furnish us with these more useful commodities for whatever bread be more worth than acorns wine than water and cloth or silk than leave skin or moss that be wholly owe to labour and industry the one of these be the food and raiment which unassisted nature furnish us with the other provision which our industry and pain prepare for us which how much they exceed the other in value when any one hath compute he will then see how much labour make the far greatest part of the value of things we enjoy in this world and the grind which produce the materials be scarce to be reckon in as any or at most but a very small part of it so little that even amongst us land that be leave wholly to nature that hath no improvement of pasturage tillage or plant be call as indeed it be waste and we shall find the benefit of it amount to little more than nothing an acre of land that bear here twenty bushel of wheat and another in america which with the same husbandry would do the like be without doubt of the same natural intrinsic value but yet the benefit mankind receive from one in a year be worth five pound and the other possibly not worth a penny if all the profit an indian receive from it be to be value and sell here at least i may truly say not one thousandth it be labour then which put the greatest part of value upon land without which it would scarcely be worth anything it be to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful products for all that the straw bran bread of that acre of wheat be more worth than the product of an acre of as good land which lie waste be all the effect of labour for it be not barely the ploughmans pain the reapers and threshers toil and the bakers sweat be to be count into the bread we eat the labour of those who break the oxen who digged and work the iron and stone who fell and frame the timber employ about the plough mill oven or any other utensils which be a vast number requisite to this corn from its sow to its be make bread must all be charge on the account of labour and receive as an effect of that nature and the earth furnish only the almost worthless materials as in themselves it would be a strange catalogue of things that industry provide and make use of about every loaf of bread before it come to our use if we could trace them iron wood leather bark timber stone bricks coal lime cloth dyeingdrugs pitch tar masts rope and all the materials make use of in the ship that bring any of the commodities make use of by any of the workmen to any part of the work all which it would be almost impossible at least too long to reckon up from all which it be evident that though the things of nature be give in common man by be master of himself and proprietor of his own person and the action or labour of it have still in himself the great foundation of property and that which make up the great part of what he apply to the support or comfort of his be when invention and arts have improve the conveniences of life be perfectly his own and do not belong in common to others thus labour in the begin give a right of property wherever any one be please to employ it upon what be common which remain a long while the far greater part and be yet more than mankind make use of men at first for the most part content themselves with what unassisted nature offer to their necessities and though afterwards in some part of the world where the increase of people and stock with the use of money have make land scarce and so of some value the several communities settle the bound of their distinct territories and by laws within themselves regulate the properties of the private men of their society and so by compact and agreement settle the property which labour and industry begin and the league that have be make between several state and kingdoms either expressly or tacitly disown all claim and right to the land in the others possession have by common consent give up their pretences to their natural common right which originally they have to those countries and so have by positive agreement settle a property amongst themselves in distinct part of the world yet there be still great tracts of grind to be find which the inhabitants thereof not have join with the rest of mankind in the consent of the use of their common money lie waste and be more than the people who dwell on it do or can make use of and so still lie in common though this can scarce happen amongst that part of mankind that have consent to the use of money the greatest part of things really useful to the life of man and such as the necessity of subsist make the first commoners of the world look afteras it doth the americans noware generally things of short duration such asif they be not consume by use will decay and perish of themselves gold silver and diamonds be things that fancy or agreement hath put the value on more than real use and the necessary support of life now of those good things which nature hath provide in common every one hath a right as hath be say to as much as he could use and have a property in all he could effect with his labour all that his industry could extend to to alter from the state nature have put it in be his he that gather a hundred bushel of acorns or apples have thereby a property in them they be his goods as soon as gather he be only to look that he use them before they spoil else he take more than his share and rob others and indeed it be a foolish thing as well as dishonest to hoard up more than he could make use of if he give away a part to anybody else so that it perish not uselessly in his possession these he also make use of and if he also barter away plums that would have rot in a week for nut that would last good for his eat a whole year he do no injury he waste not the common stock destroy no part of the portion of goods that belong to others so long as nothing perish uselessly in his hand again if he would give his nut for a piece of metal please with its colour or exchange his sheep for shell or wool for a sparkle pebble or a diamond and keep those by him all his life he invade not the right of others he might heap up as much of these durable things as he please the exceed of the bound of his just property not lie in the largeness of his possession but the perish of anything uselessly in it and thus come in the use of money some last thing that men might keep without spoil and that by mutual consent men would take in exchange for the truly useful but perishable support of life and as different degrees of industry be apt to give men possessions in different proportion so this invention of money give them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them for suppose an island separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world wherein there be but a hundred families but there be sheep horse and cow with other useful animals wholesome fruit and land enough for corn for a hundred thousand time as many but nothing in the island either because of its commonness or perishableness fit to supply the place of money what reason could any one have there to enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family and a plentiful supply to its consumption either in what their own industry produce or they could barter for like perishable useful commodities with others where there be not something both last and scarce and so valuable to be hoard up there men will not be apt to enlarge their possessions of land be it never so rich never so free for them to take for i ask what would a man value ten thousand or an hundred thousand acres of excellent land ready cultivate and well stock too with cattle in the middle of the inland part of america where he have no hop of commerce with other part of the world to draw money to him by the sale of the product it would not be worth the enclose and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature whatever be more than would supply the conveniences of life to be have there for him and his family thus in the begin all the world be america and more so than that be now for no such thing as money be anywhere know find out something that hath the use and value of money amongst his neighbour you shall see the same man will begin presently to enlarge his possessions but since gold and silver be little useful to the life of man in proportion to food raiment and carriage have its value only from the consent of menwhereof labour yet make in great part the measure it be plain that the consent of men have agree to a disproportionate and unequal possession of the earthi mean out of the bound of society and compact for in governments the laws regulate it they have by consent find out and agree in a way how a man may rightfully and without injury possess more than he himself can make use of by receive gold and silver which may continue long in a man possession without decay for the overplus and agree those metal should have a value and thus i think it be very easy to conceive without any difficulty how labour could at first begin a title of property in the common things of nature and how the spend it upon our use bound it so that there could then be no reason of quarrel about title nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it give right and conveniency go together for as a man have a right to all he could employ his labour upon so he have no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of this leave no room for controversy about the title nor for encroachment on the right of others what portion a man carve to himself be easily see and it be useless as well as dishonest to carve himself too much or take more than he need i of paternal power it may perhaps be censure an impertinent criticism in a discourse of this nature to find fault with word and name that have obtain in the world and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new ones when the old be apt to lead men into mistake as this of paternal power probably have do which seem so to place the power of parent over their children wholly in the father as if the mother have no share in it whereas if we consult reason or revelation we shall find she have an equal title which may give one reason to ask whether this might not be more properly call parental power for whatever obligation nature and the right of generation lay on children it must certainly bind them equal to both the concurrent cause of it and accordingly we see the positive law of god everywhere join them together without distinction when it command the obedience of children honour thy father and thy mother exod whosoever curseth his father or his mother lev ye shall fear every man his mother and his father lev children obey your parent eph etc be the style of the old and new testament have but this one thing be well consider without look any deeper into the matter it might perhaps have keep men from run into those gross mistake they have make about this power of parent which however it might without any great harshness bear the name of absolute dominion and regal authority when under the title of paternal power it seem appropriate to the father would yet have sound but oddly and in the very name show the absurdity if this suppose absolute power over children have be call parental and thereby discover that it belong to the mother too for it will but very ill serve the turn of those men who contend so much for the absolute power and authority of the fatherhood as they call it that the mother should have any share in it and it would have but ill support the monarchy they contend for when by the very name it appear that that fundamental authority from whence they would derive their government of a single person only be not place in one but two persons jointly but to let this of name pass though i have say above that all men by nature be equal i can not be suppose to understand all sort of equality age or virtue may give men a just precedency excellency of part and merit may place others above the common level birth may subject some and alliance or benefit others to pay an observance to those to whom nature gratitude or other respect may have make it due and yet all this consist with the equality which all men be in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another which be the equality i there speak of as proper to the business in hand be that equal right that every man hath to his natural freedom without be subject to the will or authority of any other man children i confess be not bear in this full state of equality though they be bear to it their parent have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it be but a temporary one the bond of this subjection be like the swaddle clothe they be wrapt up in and support by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a man at his own free disposal adam be create a perfect man his body and mind in full possession of their strength and reason and so be capable from the first instance of his be to provide for his own support and preservation and govern his action accord to the dictate of the law of reason god have implant in him from him the world be people with his descendants who be all bear infants weak and helpless without knowledge or understand but to supply the defect of this imperfect state till the improvement of growth and age have remove them adam and eve and after them all parent be by the law of nature under an obligation to preserve nourish and educate the children they have beget not as their own workmanship but the workmanship of their own maker the almighty to whom they be to be accountable for them the law that be to govern adam be the same that be to govern all his posterity the law of reason but his offspring have another way of entrance into the world different from him by a natural birth that produce them ignorant and without the use of reason they be not presently under that law for nobody can be under a law that be not promulgate to him and this law be promulgate or make know by reason only he that be not come to the use of his reason can not be say to be under this law and adams children be not presently as soon as bear under this law of reason be not presently free for law in its true notion be not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper interest and prescribe no farther than be for the general good of those under that law could they be happier without it the law as a useless thing would of itself vanish and that ill deserve the name of confinement which hedge us in only from bog and precipices so that however it may be mistake the end of law be not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the state of create be capable of laws where there be no law there be no freedom for liberty be to be free from restraint and violence from others which can not be where there be no law and be not as we be tell a liberty for every man to do what he list for who could be free when every other man humour might domineer over him but a liberty to dispose and order freely as he list his person action possessions and his whole property within the allowance of those laws under which he be and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another but freely follow his own the power then that parent have over their children arise from that duty which be incumbent on them to take care of their offspring during the imperfect state of childhood to inform the mind and govern the action of their yet ignorant nonage till reason shall take its place and ease them of that trouble be what the children want and the parent be bind to for god have give man an understand to direct his action have allow him a freedom of will and liberty of act as properly belong thereunto within the bound of that law he be under but whilst he be in an estate wherein he have no understand of his own to direct his will he be not to have any will of his own to follow he that understand for him must will for him too he must prescribe to his will and regulate his action but when he come to the estate that make his father a free man the son be a free man too this hold in all the laws a man be under whether natural or civil be a man under the law of nature what make him free of that law what give him a free dispose of his property accord to his own will within the compass of that law i answer an estate wherein he might be suppose capable to know that law that so he might keep his action within the bound of it when he have acquire that state he be presume to know how far that law be to be his guide and how far he may make use of his freedom and so come to have it till then somebody else must guide him who be presume to know how far the law allow a liberty if such a state of reason such an age of discretion make him free the same shall make his son free too be a man under the law of england what make him free of that lawthat be to have the liberty to dispose of his action and possessions accord to his own will within the permission of that law a capacity of know that law which be suppose by that law at the age of twentyone and in some case sooner if this make the father free it shall make the son free too till then we see the law allow the son to have no will but he be to be guide by the will of his father or guardian who be to understand for him and if the father die and fail to substitute a deputy in this trust if he hath not provide a tutor to govern his son during his minority during his want of understand the law take care to do it some other must govern him and be a will to him till he hath attain to a state of freedom and his understand be fit to take the government of his will but after that the father and son be equally free as much as tutor and pupil after nonage equally subject of the same law together without any dominion leave in the father over the life liberty or estate of his son whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature or under the positive laws of an establish government but if through defect that may happen out of the ordinary course of nature any one come not to such a degree of reason wherein he might be suppose capable of know the law and so live within the rule of it he be never capable of be a free man he be never let loose to the disposure of his own will because he know no bound to it have not understand its proper guide but be continue under the tuition and government of others all the time his own understand be inca pable of that charge and so lunatics and idiots be never set free from the government of their parent children who be not as yet come unto those years whereat they may have and innocents which be exclude by a natural defect from ever have thirdly madmen which for the present can not possibly have the use of right reason to guide themselves have for their guide the reason that guideth other men which be tutor over them to seek and procure their good for them say hooker eccl pol lib i s all which seem no more than that duty which god and nature have lay on man as well as other creatures to preserve their offspring till they can be able to shift for themselves and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of parent regal authority thus we be bear free as we be bear rational not that we have actually the exercise of either age that bring one bring with it the other too and thus we see how natural freedom and subjection to parent may consist together and be both found on the same principle a child be free by his father title by his father understand which be to govern him till he hath it of his own the freedom of a man at years of discretion and the subjection of a child to his parent whilst yet short of it be so consistent and so distinguishable that the most blind contenders for monarchy by right of fatherhood can not miss of it the most obstinate can not but allow of it for be their doctrine all true be the right heir of adam now know and by that title settle a monarch in his throne invest with all the absolute unlimited power sir robert filmer talk of if he should die as soon as his heir be bear must not the child notwithstanding he be never so free never so much sovereign be in subjection to his mother and nurse to tutor and governors till age and education bring him reason and ability to govern himself and others the necessities of his life the health of his body and the information of his mind would require him to be direct by the will of others and not his own and yet will any one think that this restraint and subjection be inconsistent with or spoil him of that liberty or sovereignty he have a right to or give away his empire to those who have the government of his nonage this government over him only prepare him the better and sooner for it if anybody should ask me when my son be of age to be free i shall answer just when his monarch be of age to govern but at what time say the judicious hooker eccl pol lib i s a man may be say to have attain so far forth the use of reason as sufficeth to make him capable of those laws whereby he be then bind to guide his action this be a great deal more easy for sense to discern than for any one by skill and learn to determine commonwealths themselves take notice of and allow that there be a time when men be to begin to act like free men and therefore till that time require not oaths of fealty or allegiance or other public own of or submission to the government of their countries the freedom then of man and liberty of act accord to his own will be ground on his have reason which be able to instruct him in that law he be to govern himself by and make him know how far he be leave to the freedom of his own will to turn him loose to an unrestrained liberty before he have reason to guide him be not the allow him the privilege of his nature to be free but to thrust him out amongst brutes and abandon him to a state as wretched and as much beneath that of a man as theirs this be that which put the authority into the parent hand to govern the minority of their children god hath make it their business to employ this care on their offspring and hath place in them suitable inclinations of tenderness and concern to temper this power to apply it as his wisdom design it to the childrens good as long as they should need to be under it but what reason can hence advance this care of the parent due to their offspring into an absolute arbitrary dominion of the father whose power reach no farther than by such a discipline as he find most effectual to give such strength and health to their body such vigour and rectitude to their mind as may best fit his children to be most useful to themselves and others and if it be necessary to his condition to make them work when they be able for their own subsistence but in this power the mother too have her share with the father nay this power so little belong to the father by any peculiar right of nature but only as he be guardian of his children that when he quit his care of them he lose his power over them which go along with their nourishment and education to which it be inseparably annex and belong as much to the fosterfather of an expose child as to the natural father of another so little power do the bare act of beget give a man over his issue if all his care end there and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority of a father and what will become of this paternal power in that part of the world where one woman hath more than one husband at a time or in those part of america where when the husband and wife part which happen frequently the children be all leave to the mother follow her and be wholly under her care and provision and if the father die whilst the children be young do they not naturally everywhere owe the same obedience to their mother during their minority as to their father be he alive and will any one say that the mother hath a legislative power over her children that she can make stand rule which shall be of perpetual obligation by which they ought to regulate all the concern of their property and bind their liberty all the course of their live and enforce the observation of them with capital punishments for this be the proper power of the magistrate of which the father hath not so much as the shadow his command over his children be but temporary and reach not their life or property it be but a help to the weakness and imperfection of their nonage a discipline necessary to their education and though a father may dispose of his own possessions as he please when his children be out of danger of perish for want yet his power extend not to the live or goods which either their own industry or anothers bounty have make theirs nor to their liberty neither when they be once arrive to the enfranchisement of the years of discretion the father empire then cease and he can from thenceforward no more dispose of the liberty of his son than that of any other man and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdiction from which a man may withdraw himself have licence from divine authority to leave father and mother and cleave to his wife but though there be a time when a child come to be as free from subjection to the will and command of his father as he himself be free from subjection to the will of anybody else and they be both under no other restraint but that which be common to them both whether it be the law of nature or municipal law of their country yet this freedom exempt not a son from that honour which he ought by the law of god and nature to pay his parent god have make the parent instrument in his great design of continue the race of mankind and the occasion of life to their children as he hath lay on them an obligation to nourish preserve and bring up their offspring so he have lay on the children a perpetual obligation of honour their parent which contain in it an inward esteem and reverence to be show by all outward expressions tie up the child from anything that may ever injure or affront disturb or endanger the happiness or life of those from whom he receive his and engage him in all action of defence relief assistance and comfort of those by whose mean he enter into be and have be make capable of any enjoyments of life from this obligation no state no freedom can absolve children but this be very far from give parent a power of command over their children or an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their live or liberties it be one thing to owe honour respect gratitude and assistance another to require an absolute obedience and submission the honour due to parent a monarch on his throne owe his mother and yet this lessen not his authority nor subject him to her government the subjection of a minor place in the father a temporary government which terminate with the minority of the child and the honour due from a child place in the parent a perpetual right to respect reverence support and compliance to more or less as the father care cost and kindness in his education have be more or less and this end not with minority but hold in all part and condition of a man life the want of distinguish these two power which the father hath in the right of tuition during minority and the right of honour all his life may perhaps have cause a great part of the mistake about this matter for to speak properly of them the first of these be rather the privilege of children and duty of parent than any prerogative of paternal power the nourishment and education of their children be a charge so incumbent on parent for their childrens good that nothing can absolve them from take care of it and though the power of command and chastise them go along with it yet god hath weave into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for their offspring that there be little fear that parent should use their power with too much rigour the excess be seldom on the severe side the strong bias of nature draw the other way and therefore god almighty when he would express his gentle deal with the israelites he tell them that though he chasten them he chasten them as a man chasten his son deut ie with tenderness and affection and keep them under no severer discipline than what be absolutely best for them and have be less kindness to have slacken this be that power to which children be command obedience that the pain and care of their parent may not be increase or illrewarded on the other side honour and support all that which gratitude require to return for the benefit receive by and from them be the indispensable duty of the child and the proper privilege of the parent this be intend for the parent advantage as the other be for the childs though education the parent duty seem to have most power because the ignorance and infirmities of childhood stand in need of restraint and correction which be a visible exercise of rule and a kind of dominion and that duty which be comprehend in the word honour require less obedience though the obligation be stronger on grow than younger children for who can think the command children obey your parent require in a man that have children of his own the same submission to his father as it do in his yet young children to him and that by this precept he be bind to obey all his father command if out of a conceit of authority he should have the indiscretion to treat him still as a boy the first part then of paternal power or rather duty which be education belong so to the father that it terminate at a certain season when the business of education be over it cease of itself and be also alienable before for a man may put the tuition of his son in other hand and he that have make his son an apprentice to another have discharge him during that time of a great part of his obedience both to himself and to his mother but all the duty of honour the other part remain nevertheless entire to them nothing can cancel that it be so inseparable from them both that the father authority can not dispossess the mother of this right nor can any man discharge his son from honour her that bore him but both these be very far from a power to make laws and enforce them with penalties that may reach estate liberty limbs and life the power of command end with nonage and though after that honour and respect support and defence and whatsoever gratitude can oblige a man to for the highest benefit he be naturally capable of be always due from a son to his parent yet all this put no sceptre into the father hand no sovereign power of command he have no dominion over his sons property or action nor any right that his will should prescribe to his sons in all things however it may become his son in many things not very inconvenient to him and his family to pay a deference to it a man may owe honour and respect to an ancient or wise man defence to his child or friend relief and support to the distress and gratitude to a benefactor to such a degree that all he have all he can do can not sufficiently pay it but all these give no authority no right of make laws to any one over him from whom they be owe and it be plain all this be due not to the bare title of father not only because as have be say it be owe to the mother too but because these obligations to parent and the degrees of what be require of children may be vary by the different care and kindness trouble and expense be often employ upon one child more than another this show the reason how it come to pass that parent in societies where they themselves be subject retain a power over their children and have as much right to their subjection as those who be in the state of nature which could not possibly be if all political power be only paternal and that in truth they be one and the same thing for then all paternal power be in the prince the subject could naturally have none of it but these two power political and paternal be so perfectly distinct and separate and build upon so different foundations and give to so different end that every subject that be a father have as much a paternal power over his children as the prince have over his and every prince that have parent owe them as much filial duty and obedience as the meanest of his subject do to theirs and can therefore contain not any part or degree of that kind of dominion which a prince or magistrate have over his subject though the obligation on the parent to bring up their children and the obligation on children to honour their parent contain all the power on the one hand and submission on the other which be proper to this relation yet there be another power ordinarily in the father whereby he have a tie on the obedience of his children which though it be common to him with other men yet the occasion of show it almost constantly happen to father in their private families and in instance of it elsewhere be rare and less take notice of it pass in the world for a part of paternal jurisdiction and this be the power men generally have to bestow their estates on those who please them best the possession of the father be the expectation and inheritance of the children ordinarily in certain proportion accord to the law and custom of each country yet it be commonly in the father power to bestow it with a more spar or liberal hand accord as the behaviour of this or that child hath comport with his will and humour this be no small tie to the obedience of children and there be always annex to the enjoyment of land a submission to the government of the country of which that land be a part it have be commonly suppose that a father could oblige his posterity to that government of which he himself be a subject that his compact hold them whereas it be only a necessary condition annex to the land which be under that government reach only those who will take it on that condition and so be no natural tie or engagement but a voluntary submission for every man children be by nature as free as himself or any of his ancestors ever be may whilst they be in that freedom choose what society they will join themselves to what commonwealth they will put themselves under but if they will enjoy the inheritance of their ancestors they must take it on the same term their ancestors have it and submit to all the condition annex to such a possession by this power indeed father oblige their children to obedience to themselves even when they be past minority and most commonly too subject them to this or that political power but neither of these by any peculiar right of fatherhood but by the reward they have in their hand to enforce and recompense such a compliance and be no more power than what a frenchman have over an englishman who by the hop of an estate he will leave him will certainly have a strong tie on his obedience and if when it be leave him he will enjoy it he must certainly take it upon the condition annex to the possession of land in that country where it lie whether it be france or england to conclude then though the father power of command extend no farther than the minority of his children and to a degree only fit for the discipline and government of that age and though that honour and respect and all that which the latins call piety which they indispensably owe to their parent all their lifetime and in all estates with all that support and defence be due to them give the father no power of governingie make laws and exact penalties on his children though by this he have no dominion over the property or action of his son yet it be obvious to conceive how easy it be in the first age of the world and in place still where the thinness of people give families leave to separate into unpossessed quarter and they have room to remove and plant themselves in yet vacant habitations for the father of the family to become the prince of it he have be a ruler from the begin of the infancy of his children and when they be grow up since without some government it would be hard for them to live together it be likeliest it should by the express or tacit consent of the children be in the father where it seem without any change barely to continue and when indeed nothing more be require to it than the permit the father to exercise alone in his family that executive power of the law of nature which every free man naturally hath and by that permission resign up to him a monarchical power whilst they remain in it but that this be not by any paternal right but only by the consent of his children be evident from hence that nobody doubt but if a stranger whom chance or business have bring to his family have there kill any of his children or commit any other act he might condemn and put him to death or otherwise have punish him as well as any of his children which be impossible he should do by virtue of any paternal authority over one who be not his child but by virtue of that executive power of the law of nature which as a man he have a right to and he alone could punish him in his family where the respect of his children have lay by the exercise of such a power to give way to the dignity and authority they be will should remain in him above the rest of his family thus it be easy and almost natural for children by a tacit and almost natural consent to make way for the father authority and government they have be accustom in their childhood to follow his direction and to refer their little differences to him and when they be men who be fitter to rule them their little properties and less covetousness seldom afford greater controversies and when any should arise where could they have a fitter umpire than he by whose care they have every one be sustain and bring up and who have a tenderness for them all it be no wonder that they make no distinction betwixt minority and full age nor look after oneandtwenty or any other age that might make them the free disposers of themselves and fortunes when they could have no desire to be out of their pupilage the government they have be under during it continue still to be more their protection than restraint and they could nowhere find a greater security to their peace liberties and fortunes than in the rule of a father thus the natural father of families by an insensible change become the politic monarchs of them too and as they chance to live long and leave able and worthy heirs for several successions or otherwise so they lay the foundations of hereditary or elective kingdoms under several constitutions and manors accord as chance contrivance or occasion happen to mould them but if princes have their title in the father right and it be a sufficient proof of the natural right of father to political authority because they commonly be those in whose hand we find de facto the exercise of government i say if this argument be good it will as strongly prove that all princes nay princes only ought to be priests since it be as certain that in the begin the father of the family be priest as that he be ruler in his own household ii of political or civil society god have make man such a creature that in his own judgment it be not good for him to be alone put him under strong obligations of necessity convenience and inclination to drive him into society as well as fit him with understand and language to continue and enjoy it the first society be between man and wife which give begin to that between parent and children to which in time that between master and servant come to be add and though all these might and commonly do meet together and make up but one family wherein the master or mistress of it have some sort of rule proper to a family each of these or all together come short of political society as we shall see if we consider the different end tie and bound of each of these conjugal society be make by a voluntary compact between man and woman and though it consist chiefly in such a communion and right in one anothers body as be necessary to its chief end procreation yet it draw with it mutual support and assistance and a communion of interest too as necessary not only to unite their care and affection but also necessary to their common offspring who have a right to be nourish and maintain by them till they be able to provide for themselves for the end of conjunction between male and female be not barely procreation but the continuation of the species this conjunction betwixt male and female ought to last even after procreation so long as be necessary to the nourishment and support of the young ones who be to be sustain by those that get them till they be able to shift and provide for themselves this rule which the infinite wise maker hath set to the work of his hand we find the inferior creatures steadily obey in those vivaporous animals which fee on grass the conjunction between male and female last no longer than the very act of copulation because the teat of the dam be sufficient to nourish the young till it be able to fee on grass the male only beget but concern not himself for the female or young to whose sustenance he can contribute nothing but in beasts of prey the conjunction last longer because the dam not be able well to subsist herself and nourish her numerous offspring by her own prey alone a more laborious as well as more dangerous way of live than by feed on grass the assistance of the male be necessary to the maintenance of their common family which can not subsist till they be able to prey for themselves but by the joint care of male and female the same be observe in all bird except some domestic ones where plenty of food excuse the cock from feed and take care of the young brood whose young need food in the nest the cock and hen continue mat till the young be able to use their wing and provide for themselves and herein i think lie the chief if not the only reason why the male and female in mankind be tie to a longer conjunction than other creaturesviz because the female be capable of conceive and de facto be commonly with child again and bring forth too a new birth long before the former be out of a dependency for support on his parent help and able to shift for himself and have all the assistance due to him from his parent whereby the father who be bind to take care for those he hath beget be under an obligation to continue in conjugal society with the same woman longer than other creatures whose young be able to subsist of themselves before the time of procreation return again the conjugal bond dissolve of itself and they be at liberty till hymen at his usual anniversary season summon them again to choose new mat wherein one can not but admire the wisdom of the great creator who have give to man an ability to lay up for the future as well as supply the present necessity hath make it necessary that society of man and wife should be more last than of male and female amongst other creatures that so their industry might be encourage and their interest better unite to make provision and lay up goods for their common issue which uncertain mixture or easy and frequent solutions of conjugal society would mightily disturb but though these be tie upon mankind which make the conjugal bond more firm and last in a man than the other species of animals yet it would give one reason to inquire why this compact where procreation and education be secure and inheritance take care for may not be make determinable either by consent or at a certain time or upon certain condition as well as any other voluntary compact there be no necessity in the nature of the thing nor to the end of it that it should always be for lifei mean to such as be under no restraint of any positive law which ordain all such contract to be perpetual but the husband and wife though they have but one common concern yet have different understand will unavoidably sometimes have different will too it therefore be necessary that the last determination ie the rule should be place somewhere it naturally fall to the man share as the abler and the stronger but this reach but to the things of their common interest and property leave the wife in the full and true possession of what by contract be her peculiar right and at least give the husband no more power over her than she have over his life the power of the husband be so far from that of an absolute monarch that the wife have in many case a liberty to separate from him where natural right or their contract allow it whether that contract be make by themselves in the state of nature or by the customs or laws of the country they live in and the children upon such separation fall to the father or mother lot as such contract do determine for all the end of marriage be to be obtain under politic government as well as in the state of nature the civil magistrate doth not abridge the right or power of either naturally necessary to those endsviz procreation and mutual support and assistance whilst they be together but only decide any controversy that may arise between man and wife about them if it be otherwise and that absolute sovereignty and power of life and death naturally belong to the husband and be necessary to the society between man and wife there could be no matrimony in any of these countries where the husband be allow no such absolute authority but the end of matrimony require no such power in the husband it be not at all necessary to it the condition of conjugal society put it not in him but whatsoever might consist with procreation and support of the children till they could shift for themselvesmutual assistance comfort and maintenancemight be vary and regulate by that contract which first unite them in that society nothing be necessary to any society that be not necessary to the end for which it be make the society betwixt parent and children and the distinct right and power belong respectively to them i have treat of so largely in the forego chapter that i shall not here need to say anything of it and i think it be plain that it be far different from a politic society master and servant be name as old as history but give to those of far different condition for a free man make himself a servant to another by sell him for a certain time the service he undertake to do in exchange for wag he be to receive and though this commonly put him into the family of his master and under the ordinary discipline thereof yet it give the master but a temporary power over him and no greater than what be contain in the contract between them but there be another sort of servant which by a peculiar name we call slave who be captives take in a just war be by the right of nature subject to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power of their master these men have as i say forfeit their live and with it their liberties and lose their estates and be in the state of slavery not capable of any property can not in that state be consider as any part of civil society the chief end whereof be the preservation of property let us therefore consider a master of a family with all these subordinate relations of wife children servants and slave unite under the domestic rule of a family with what resemblance soever it may have in its order offices and number too with a little commonwealth yet be very far from it both in its constitution power and end or if it must be think a monarchy and the paterfamilias the absolute monarch in it absolute monarchy will have but a very shatter and short power when it be plain by what have be say before that the master of the family have a very distinct and differently limit power both as to time and extent over those several persons that be in it for except the slave and the family be as much a family and his power as paterfamilias as great whether there be any slave in his family or no he have no legislative power of life and death over any of them and none too but what a mistress of a family may have as well as he and he certainly can have no absolute power over the whole family who have but a very limit one over every individual in it but how a family or any other society of men differ from that which be properly political society we shall best see by consider wherein political society itself consist man be bear as have be prove with a title to perfect freedom and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the right and privilege of the law of nature equally with any other man or number of men in the world hath by nature a power not only to preserve his property that be his life liberty and estate against the injuries and attempt of other men but to judge of and punish the breach of that law in others as he be persuade the offence deserve even with death itself in crimes where the heinousness of the fact in his opinion require it but because no political society can be nor subsist without have in itself the power to preserve the property and in order thereunto punish the offences of all those of that society there and there only be political society where every one of the members hath quit this natural power resign it up into the hand of the community in all case that exclude him not from appeal for protection to the law establish by it and thus all private judgment of every particular member be exclude the community come to be umpire and by understand indifferent rule and men authorise by the community for their execution decide all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concern any matter of right and punish those offences which any member hath commit against the society with such penalties as the law have establish whereby it be easy to discern who be and be not in political society together those who be unite into one body and have a common establish law and judicature to appeal to with authority to decide controversies between them and punish offenders be in civil society one with another but those who have no such common appeal i mean on earth be still in the state of nature each be where there be no other judge for himself and executioner which be as i have before show it the perfect state of nature and thus the commonwealth come by a power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several transgressions they think worthy of it commit amongst the members of that society which be the power of make laws as well as it have the power to punish any injury do unto any of its members by any one that be not of it which be the power of war and peace and all this for the preservation of the property of all the members of that society as far as be possible but though every man enter into society have quit his power to punish offences against the law of nature in prosecution of his own private judgment yet with the judgment of offences which he have give up to the legislative in all case where he can appeal to the magistrate he have give up a right to the commonwealth to employ his force for the execution of the judgments of the commonwealth whenever he shall be call to it which indeed be his own judgements they be make by himself or his representative and herein we have the original of the legislative and executive power of civil society which be to judge by stand laws how far offences be to be punish when commit within the commonwealth and also by occasional judgments found on the present circumstances of the fact how far injuries from without be to be vindicate and in both these to employ all the force of all the members when there shall be need wherever therefore any number of men so unite into one society as to quit every one his executive power of the law of nature and to resign it to the public there and there only be a political or civil society and this be do wherever any number of men in the state of nature enter into society to make one people one body politic under one supreme government or else when any one join himself to and incorpo rat with any government already make for hereby he authorise the society or which be all one the legislative thereof to make laws for him as the public good of the society shall require to the execution whereof his own assistance as to his own decree be due and this put men out of a state of nature into that of a commonwealth by set up a judge on earth with authority to determine all the controversies and redress the injuries that may happen to any member of the commonwealth which judge be the legislative or magistrates appoint by it and wherever there be any number of men however associate that have no such decisive power to appeal to there they be still in the state of nature and hence it be evident that absolute monarchy which by some men be count for the only government in the world be indeed inconsistent with civil society and so can be not form of civil government at all for the end of civil society be to avoid and remedy those inconvenience of the state of nature which necessarily follow from every man be judge in his own case by set up a know authority to which every one of that society may appeal upon any injury receive or controversy that may arise and which every one of the society ought to obey wherever any persons be who have not such an authority to appeal to and decide any difference between them there those persons be still in the state of nature and so be every absolute prince in respect of those who be under his dominion for he be suppose to have all both legislative and executive power in himself alone there be no judge to be find no appeal lie open to any one who may fairly and indifferently and with authority decide and from whence relief and redress may be expect of any injury or inconveniency that may be suffer from him or by his order so that such a man however entitle czar or grand signior or how you please be as much in the state of nature with all under his dominion as he be with the rest of mankind for wherever any two men be who have no stand rule and common judge to appeal to on earth for the determination of controversies of right betwixt them there they be still in the state of nature and under all the inconveniencies of it with only this woeful difference to the subject or rather slave of an absolute prince that whereas in the ordinary state of nature he have a liberty to judge of his right accord to the best of his power to maintain it but whenever his property be invade by the will and order of his monarch he have not only no appeal as those in society ought to have but as if he be degrade from the common state of rational creatures be deny a liberty to judge of or defend his right and so be expose to all the misery and inconveniencies that a man can fear from one who be in the unrestrained state of nature be yet corrupt with flattery and arm with power for he that think absolute power purify mens blood and correct the baseness of human nature need read but the history of this or any other age to be convince to the contrary he that would have be insolent and injurious in the woods of america would not probably be much better on a throne where perhaps learn and religion shall be find out to justify all that he shall do to his subject and the sword presently silence all those that dare question it for what the protection of absolute monarchy be what kind of father of their countries it make princes to be and to what a degree of happiness and security it carry civil society where this sort of government be grow to perfection he that will look into the late relation of ceylon may easily see in absolute monarchies indeed as well as other governments of the world the subject have an appeal to the law and judge to decide any controversies and restrain any violence that may happen betwixt the subject themselves one amongst another this every one think necessary and believe he deserve to be think a declare enemy to society and mankind who should go about to take it away but whether this be from a true love of mankind and society and such a charity as we owe all one to another there be reason to doubt for this be no more than what every man who love his own power profit or greatness may and naturally must do keep those animals from hurt or destroy one another who labour and drudge only for his pleasure and advantage and so be take care of not out of any love the master have for them but love of himself and the profit they bring him for if it be ask what security what fence be there in such a state against the violence and oppression of this absolute ruler the very question can scarce be bear they be ready to tell you that it deserve death only to ask after safety betwixt subject and subject they will grant there must be measure laws and judge for their mutual peace and security but as for the ruler he ought to be absolute and be above all such circumstances because he have a power to do more hurt and wrong it be right when he do it to ask how you may be guard from or injury on that side where the strongest hand be to do it be presently the voice of faction and rebellion as if when men quit the state of nature enter into society they agree that all of them but one should be under the restraint of laws but that he should still retain all the liberty of the state of nature increase with power and make licentious by impunity this be to think that men be so foolish that they take care to avoid what mischiefs may be do them by polecats or fox but be content nay think it safety to be devour by lions but whatever flatterers may talk to amuse people understand it never hinder men from feel and when they perceive that any man in what station soever be out of the bound of the civil society they be of and that they have no appeal on earth against any harm they may receive from him they be apt to think themselves in the state of nature in respect of him whom they find to be so and to take care as soon as they can to have that safety and security in civil society for which it be first institute and for which only they enter into it and therefore though perhaps at first as shall be show more at large hereafter in the follow part of this discourse some one good and excellent man have get a preeminency amongst the rest have this deference pay to his goodness and virtue as to a kind of natural authority that the chief rule with arbitration of their differences by a tacit consent devolve into his hand without any other caution but the assurance they have of his uprightness and wisdom yet when time give authority and as some men would persuade us sacredness to customs which the negligent and unforeseeing innocence of the first age begin have bring in successors of another stamp the people find their properties not secure under the government as then it be whereas government have no other end but the preservation of property could never be safe nor at rest nor think themselves in civil society till the legislative be so place in collective body of men call them senate parliament or what you please by which mean every single person become subject equally with other the meanest men to those laws which he himself as part of the legislative have establish nor could any one by his own authority avoid the force of the law when once make nor by any pretence of superiority plead exemption thereby to license his own or the miscarriages of any of his dependants no man in civil society can be exempt from the laws of it for if any man may do what he think fit and there be no appeal on earth for redress or security against any harm he shall do i ask whether he be not perfectly still in the state of nature and so can be no part or member of that civil society unless any one will say the state of nature and civil society be one and the same thing which i have never yet find any one so great a patron of anarchy as to affirm iii of the begin of political societies men be as have be say by nature all free equal and independent no one can be put out of this estate and subject to the political power of another without his own consent which be do by agree with other men to join and unite into a community for their comfortable safe and peaceable live one amongst another in a secure enjoyment of their properties and a greater security against any that be not of it this any number of men may do because it injure not the freedom of the rest they be leave as they be in the liberty of the state of nature when any number of men have so consent to make one community or government they be thereby presently incorporate and make one body politic wherein the majority have a right to act and conclude the rest for when any number of men have by the consent of every individual make a community they have thereby make that community one body with a power to act as one body which be only by the will and determination of the majority for that which act any community be only the consent of the individuals of it and it be one body must move one way it be necessary the body should move that way whither the greater force carry it which be the consent of the majority or else it be impossible it should act or continue one body one community which the consent of every individual that unite into it agree that it should and so every one be bind by that consent to be conclude by the majority and therefore we see that in assemblies empower to act by positive laws where no number be set by that positive law which empower them the act of the majority pass for the act of the whole and of course determine as have by the law of nature and reason the power of the whole and thus every man by consent with others to make one body politic under one government put himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the determination of the majority and to be conclude by it or else this original compact whereby he with others incorporate into one society would signify nothing and be no compact if he be leave free and under no other tie than he be in before in the state of nature for what appearance would there be of any compact what new engagement if he be no farther tie by any decree of the society than he himself think fit and do actually consent to this would be still as great a liberty as he himself have before his compact or any one else in the state of nature who may submit himself and consent to any act of it if he think fit for if the consent of the majority shall not in reason be receive as the act of the whole and conclude every individual nothing but the consent of every individual can make anything to be the act of the whole which consider the infirmities of health and avocations of business which in a number though much less than that of a commonwealth will necessarily keep many away from the public assembly and the variety of opinions and contrariety of interest which unavoidably happen in all collections of men it be next impossible ever to be have and therefore if come into society be upon such term it will be only like catos come into the theatre tantum ut exiret such a constitution as this would make the mighty leviathan of a shorter duration than the feeblest creatures and not let it outlast the day it be bear in which can not be suppose till we can think that rational creatures should desire and constitute societies only to be dissolve for where the majority can not conclude the rest there they can not act as one body and consequently will be immediately dissolve again whosoever therefore out of a state of nature unite into a community must be understand to give up all the power necessary to the end for which they unite into society to the majority of the community unless they expressly agree in any number greater than the majority and this be do by barely agree to unite into one political society which be all the compact that be or need be between the individuals that enter into or make up a commonwealth and thus that which begin and actually constitute any political society be nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of majority to unite and incorporate into such a society and this be that and that only which do or could give begin to any lawful government in the world to this i find two objections make that there be no instance to be find in story of a company of men independent and equal one amongst another that meet together and in this way begin and set up a government it be impossible of right that men should do so because all men be bear under government they be to submit to that and be not at liberty to begin a new one to the first there be this to answer that it be not at all to be wonder that history give us but a very little account of men that live together in the state of nature the inconveniencies of that condition and the love and want of society no sooner bring any number of them together but they presently unite and in corporated if they design to continue together and if we may not suppose men ever to have be in the state of nature because we hear not much of them in such a state we may as well suppose the armies of salmanasser or xerxes be never children because we hear little of them till they be men and embody in armies government be everywhere antecedent to record and letter seldom come in amongst a people till a long continuation of civil society have by other more necessary arts provide for their safety ease and plenty and then they begin to look after the history of their founder and search into their original when they have outlive the memory of it for it be with commonwealths as with particular persons they be commonly ignorant of their own birth and infancies and if they know anything of it they be behold for it to the accidental record that others have keep of it and those that we have of the begin of any polities in the world except that of the jews where god himself immediately interpose and which favour not at all paternal dominion be all either plain instance of such a begin as i have mention or at least have manifest footsteps of it he must show a strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact when it agree not with his hypothesis who will not allow that the begin of rome and venice be by the unite together of several men free and independent one of another amongst whom there be no natural superiority or subjection and if josephus acostas word may be take he tell us that in many part of america there be no government at all there be great and apparent conjecture say he that these men speak of those of peru for a long time have neither kings nor commonwealths but live in troop as they do this day in florida the cheriquanas those of brazil and many other nations which have no certain kings but as occasion be offer in peace or war they choose their captain as they please lib i cap if it be say that every man there be bear subject to his father or the head of his family that the subjection due from a child to a father take away not his freedom of unite into what political society he think fit have be already prove but be that as it will these men it be evident be actually free and whatever superiority some politicians now would place in any of them they themselves claim it not but by consent be all equal till by the same consent they set rulers over themselves so that their politic societies all begin from a voluntary union and the mutual agreement of men freely act in the choice of their governors and form of govern ment and i hope those who go away from sparta with palantus mention by justin will be allow to have be freemen independent one of another and to have set up a government over themselves by their own consent thus i have give several examples out of history of people free and in the state of nature that be meet together incorporate and begin a commonwealth and if the want of such instance be an argument to prove that government be not nor could not be so begin i suppose the contenders for paternal empire be better let it alone than urge it against natural liberty for if they can give so many instance out of history of governments begin upon paternal right i think though at least an argument from what have be to what should of right be of no great force one might without any great danger yield them the cause but if i might advise them in the case they would do well not to search too much into the original of governments as they have begin de facto lest they should find at the foundation of most of them something very little favourable to the design they promote and such a power as they contend for but to conclude reason be plain on our side that men be naturally free and the examples of history show that the governments of the world that be begin in peace have their begin lay on that foundation and be make by the consent of the people there can be little room for doubt either where the right be or what have be the opinion or practice of mankind about the first erect of governments i will not deny that if we look back as far as history will direct us towards the original of commonwealths we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man and i be also apt to believe that where a family be numerous enough to subsist by itself and continue entire together without mix with others as it often happen where there be much land and few people the government commonly begin in the father for the father have by the law of nature the same power with every man else to punish as he think fit any offences against that law might thereby punish his transgress children even when they be men and out of their pupilage and they be very likely to submit to his punishment and all join with him against the offender in their turn give him thereby power to execute his sentence against any transgression and so in effect make him the lawmaker and governor over all that remain in conjunction with his family he be fittest to be trust paternal affection secure their property and interest under his care and the custom of obey him in their childhood make it easier to submit to him rather than any other if therefore they must have one to rule them as government be hardly to be avoid amongst men that live together who so likely to be the man as he that be their common father unless negligence cruelty or any other defect of mind or body make him unfit for it but when either the father die and leave his next heirfor want of age wisdom courage or any other qualitiesless fit for rule or where several families meet and consent to continue together there it be not to be doubt but they use their natural freedom to set up him whom they judge the ablest and most likely to rule well over them conformable hereunto we find the people of america wholiving out of the reach of the conquer swords and spread domination of the two great empires of peru and mexico enjoy their own natural freedom though caeteris paribus they commonly prefer the heir of their decease king yet if they find him any way weak or incapable they pass him by and set up the stoutest and bravest man for their ruler thus though look back as far as record give us any account of people the world and the history of nations we commonly find the government to be in one hand yet it destroy not that which i affirmviz that the begin of politic society depend upon the consent of the individuals to join into and make one society who when they be thus incorporate might set up what form of government they think fit but this have give occasion to men to mistake and think that by nature government be monarchical and belong to the father it may not be amiss here to consider why people in the begin generally pitch upon this form which though perhaps the father preeminency might in the first institution of some commonwealths give a rise to and place in the begin the power in one hand yet it be plain that the reason that continue the form of government in a single person be not any regard or respect to paternal authority since all petty monarchies that be almost all monarchies near their original have be commonly at least upon occasion elective first then in the begin of things the father government of the childhood of those spring from him have accustom them to the rule of one man and teach them that where it be exercise with care and skill with affection and love to those under it it be sufficient to procure and preserve men all the political happiness they seek for in society it be no wonder that they should pitch upon and naturally run into that form of government which from their infancy they have be all accustom to and which by experience they have find both easy and safe to which if we add that monarchy be simple and most obvious to men whom neither experience have instruct in form of government nor the ambition or insolence of empire have teach to beware of the encroachments of prerogative or the inconveniencies of absolute power which monarchy in succession be apt to lay claim to and bring upon them it be not at all strange that they should not much trouble themselves to think of methods of restrain any exorbitances of those to whom they have give the authority over them and of balance the power of government by place several part of it in different hand they have neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion nor do the fashion of the age nor their possessions or way of live which afford little matter for covetousness or ambition give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it and therefore it be no wonder they put themselves into such a frame of government as be not only as i say most obvious and simple but also best suit to their present state and condition which stand more in need of defence against foreign invasions and injuries than of multiplicity of laws where there be but very little property and want not variety of rulers and abundance of officer to direct and look after their execution where there be but few trespassers and few offenders since then those who like one another so well as to join into society can not but be suppose to have some acquaintance and friendship together and some trust one in another they could not but have greater apprehensions of others than of one another and therefore their first care and think can not but be suppose to be how to secure themselves against foreign force it be natural for them to put themselves under a frame of government which might best serve to that end and choose the wisest and bravest man to conduct them in their war and lead them out against their enemies and in this chiefly be their ruler thus we see that the kings of the indians in america which be still a pattern of the first age in asia and europe whilst the inhabitants be too few for the country and want of people and money give men no temptation to enlarge their possessions of land or contest for wider extent of grind be little more than general of their armies and though they command absolutely in war yet at home and in time of peace they exercise very little dominion and have but a very moderate sovereignty the resolutions of peace and war be ordinarily either in the people or in a council though the war itself which admit not of pluralities of governors naturally evolve the command into the kings sole authority and thus in israel itself the chief business of their judge and first kings seem to have be to be captain in war and leaders of their armies which besides what be signify by go out and in before the people which be to march forth to war and home again at the head of their force appear plainly in the story of jephtha the ammonites make war upon israel the gileadites in fear send to jephtha a bastard of their family whom they have cast off and article with him if he will assist them against the ammonites to make him their ruler which they do in these word and the people make him head and captain over them judge which be as it seem all one as to be judge and he judge israel judge that be be their captaingeneral six years so when jotham upbraid the shechemites with the obligation they have to gideon who have be their judge and ruler he tell them he fight for you and adventure his life for and deliver you out of the hand of midian judge nothing mention of him but what he do as a general and indeed that be all be find in his history or in any of the rest of the judge and abimelech particularly be call king though at most he be but their general and when be weary of the illconduct of samuels sons the children of israel desire a king like all the nations to judge them and to go out before them and to fight their battle sam god grant their desire say to samuel i will send thee a man and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines ch as if the only business of a king have be to lead out their armies and fight in their defence and accordingly at his inauguration pour a vial of oil upon him declare to saul that the lord have anoint him to be captain over his inheritance ch and therefore those who after saul be solemnly choose and salute king by the tribes at mispah be unwilling to have him their king make no other objection but this how shall this man save us ch as if they should have say this man be unfit to be our king not have skill and conduct enough in war to be able to defend us and when god resolve to transfer the government to david it be in these word but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath seek him a man after his own heart and the lord hath command him to be captain over his people ch as if the whole kingly authority be nothing else but to be their general and therefore the tribes who have stick to sauls family and oppose davids reign when they come to hebron with term of submission to him they tell him amongst other arguments they have to submit to him as to their king that he be in effect their king in sauls time and therefore they have no reason but to receive him as their king now also say they in time past when saul be king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord say unto thee thou shalt fee my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel thus whether a family by degrees grow up into a commonwealth and the fatherly authority be continue on to the elder son every one in his turn grow up under it tacitly submit to it and the easiness and equality of it not offend any one every one acquiesce till time seem to have confirm it and settle a right of succession by prescription or whether several families or the descendants of several families whom chance neighbourhood or business bring together unite into society the need of a general whose conduct might defend them against their enemies in war and the great confidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but virtuous age such as be almost all those which begin governments that ever come to last in the world give men one of another make the first beginners of commonwealths generally put the rule into one man hand without any other express limitation or restraint but what the nature of the thing and the end of government require it be give them for the public good and safety and to those end in the infancies of commonwealths they commonly use it and unless they have do so young societies could not have subsist without such nurse father without this care of the governors all governments would have sink under the weakness and infirmities of their infancy the prince and the people have soon perish together but the golden age though before vain ambition and amor sceleratus habendi evil concupiscence have corrupt mens mind into a mistake of true power and honour have more virtue and consequently better governors as well as less vicious subject and there be then no stretch prerogative on the one side to oppress the people nor consequently on the other any dispute about privilege to lessen or restrain the power of the magistrate and so no contest betwixt rulers and people about governors or government yet when ambition and luxury in future age would retain and increase the power without do the business for which it be give and aid by flattery teach princes to have distinct and separate interest from their people men find it necessary to examine more carefully the original and right of government and to find out ways to restrain the exorbitances and prevent the abuse of that power which they have entrust in anothers hand only for their own good they find be make use of to hurt them thus we may see how probable it be that people that be naturally free and by their own consent either submit to the government of their father or unite together out of different families to make a government should generally put the rule into one man hand and choose to be under the conduct of a single person without so much as by express condition limit or regulate his power which they think safe enough in his honesty and prudence though they never dream of monarchy be jure divino which we never hear of among mankind till it be reveal to us by the divinity of this last age nor ever allow paternal power to have a right to dominion or to be the foundation of all government and thus much may suffice to show that as far as we have any light from history we have reason to conclude that all peaceful beginnings of government have be lay in the consent of the people i say peaceful because i shall have occasion in another place to speak of conquest which some esteem a way of begin of governments the other objection i find urge against the begin of polities in the way i have mention be this viz that all men be bear under government some or other it be impossible any of them should ever be free and at liberty to unite together and begin a new one or ever be able to erect a lawful government if this argument be good i ask how come so many lawful monarchies into the world for if anybody upon this supposition can show me any one man in any age of the world free to begin a lawful monarchy i will be bind to show him ten other free men at liberty at the same time to unite and begin a new government under a regal or any other form it be demonstration that if any one bear under the dominion of another may be so free as to have a right to command others in a new and distinct empire every one that be bear under the dominion of another may be so free too and may become a ruler or subject of a distinct separate government and so by this their own principle either all men however bear be free or else there be but one lawful prince one lawful government in the world and then they have nothing to do but barely to show us which that be which when they have do i doubt not but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him though it be a sufficient answer to their objection to show that it involve them in the same difficulties that it doth those they use it against yet i shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this argument a little farther all men say they be bear under government and therefore they can not be at liberty to begin a new one every one be bear a subject to his father or his prince and be therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it be plain mankind never own nor consider any such natural subjection that they be bear in to one or to the other that tie them without their own consent to a subjection to them and their heirs for there be no examples so frequent in history both sacred and profane as those of men withdraw themselves and their obedience from the jurisdiction they be bear under and the family or community they be breed up in and set up new governments in other place from whence spring all that number of petty commonwealths in the begin of age and which always multiply as long as there be room enough till the stronger or more fortunate swallow the weaker and those great ones again break to piece dissolve into lesser dominions all which be so many testimonies against paternal sovereignty and plainly prove that it be not the natural right of the father descend to his heirs that make governments in the begin since it be impossible upon that grind there should have be so many little kingdoms but only one universal monarchy if men have not be at liberty to separate themselves from their families and their government be it what it will that be set up in it and go and make distinct commonwealths and other governments as they think fit this have be the practice of the world from its first begin to this day nor be it now any more hindrance to the freedom of mankind that they be bear under constitute and ancient polities that have establish laws and set form of government than if they be bear in the woods amongst the unconfined inhabitants that run loose in them for those who would persuade us that by be bear under any government we be naturally subject to it and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature have no other reason bat that of paternal power which we have already answer to produce for it but only because our father or progenitors pass away their natural liberty and thereby bind up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government which they themselves submit to it be true that whatever engagements or promise any one make for himself he be under the obligation of them but can not by any compact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man be altogether as free as the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of anybody else he may indeed annex such condition to the land he enjoy as a subject of any commonwealth as may oblige his son to be of that community if he will enjoy those possessions which be his father because that estate be his father property he may dispose or settle it as he please and this have generally give the occasion to the mistake in this matter because commonwealths not permit any part of their dominions to be dismember nor to be enjoy by any but those of their community the son can not ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his father but under the same term his father do by become a member of the society whereby he put himself presently under the government he find there establish as much as any other subject of that commonweal and thus the consent of free men bear under government which only make them members of it be give separately in their turn as each come to be of age and not in a multitude together people take no notice of it and think it not do at all or not necessary conclude they be naturally subject as they be men but it be plain governments themselves understand it otherwise they claim no power over the son because of that they have over the father nor look on children as be their subject by their father be so if a subject of england have a child by an englishwoman in france whose subject be he not the king of englands for he must have leave to be admit to the privilege of it nor the king of frances for how then have his father a liberty to bring him away and breed him as he please and whoever be judge as a traitor or deserter if he leave or war against a country for be barely bear in it of parent that be alien there it be plain then by the practice of governments themselves as well as by the law of right reason that a child be bear a subject of no country nor government he be under his father tuition and authority till he come to age of discretion and then he be a free man at liberty what government he will put himself under what body politic he will unite himself to for if an englishmans son bear in france be at liberty and may do so it be evident there be no tie upon him by his father be a subject of that kingdom nor be he bind up by any compact of his ancestors and why then hath not his son by the same reason the same liberty though he be bear anywhere else since the power that a father hath naturally over his children be the same wherever they be bear and the tie of natural obligations be not bound by the positive limit of kingdoms and commonwealths every man be as have be show naturally free and nothing be able to put him into subjection to any earthly power but only his own consent it be to be consider what shall be understand to be a sufficient declaration of a man consent to make him subject to the laws of any government there be a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent which will concern our present case nobody doubt but an express consent of any man enter into any society make him a perfect member of that society a subject of that government the difficulty be what ought to be look upon as a tacit consent and how far it bindsie how far any one shall be look on to have consent and thereby submit to any government where he have make no expressions of it at all and to this i say that every man that hath any possession or enjoyment of any part of the dominions of any government doth hereby give his tacit consent and be as far forth oblige to obedience to the laws of that government during such enjoyment as any one under it whether this his possession be of land to him and his heirs for ever or a lodge only for a week or whether it be barely travel freely on the highway and in effect it reach as far as the very be of any one within the territories of that government to understand this the better it be fit to consider that every man when he at first incorporate himself into any commonwealth he by his unite himself thereunto annex also and submit to the community those possessions which he have or shall acquire that do not already belong to any other government for it would be a direct contradiction for any one to enter into society with others for the secure and regulate of property and yet to suppose his land whose property be to be regulate by the laws of the society should be exempt from the jurisdiction of that government to which he himself and the property of the land be a subject by the same act therefore whereby any one unite his person which be before free to any commonwealth by the same he unite his possessions which be before free to it also and they become both of them person and possession subject to the government and dominion of that commonwealth as long as it hath a be whoever therefore from thenceforth by inheritance purchase permission or otherwise enjoy any part of the land so annex to and under the government of that commonweal must take it with the condition it be underthat be of submit to the government of the commonwealth under whose jurisdiction it be as far forth as any subject of it but since the government have a direct jurisdiction only over the land and reach the possessor of it before he have actually incorporate himself in the society only as he dwell upon and enjoy that the obligation any one be under by virtue of such enjoyment to submit to the government begin and end with the enjoyment so that whenever the owner who have give nothing but such a tacit consent to the government will by donation sale or otherwise quit the say possession he be at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other commonwealth or agree with others to begin a new one in vacuis locis in any part of the world they can find free and unpossessed whereas he that have once by actual agreement and any express declaration give his consent to be of any commonweal be perpetually and indispensably oblige to be and remain unalterably a subject to it and can never be again in the liberty of the state of nature unless by any calamity the government he be under come to be dissolve but submit to the laws of any country live quietly and enjoy privilege and protection under them make not a man a member of that society it be only a local protection and homage due to and from all those who not be in a state of war come within the territories belong to any government to all part whereof the force of its law extend but this no more make a man a member of that society a perpetual subject of that commonwealth than it would make a man a subject to another in whose family he find it convenient to abide for some time though whilst he continue in it he be oblige to comply with the laws and submit to the government he find there and thus we see that foreigners by live all their live under another government and enjoy the privilege and protection of it though they be bind even in conscience to submit to its administration as far forth as any denizen yet do not thereby come to be subject or members of that commonwealth nothing can make any man so but his actually enter into it by positive engagement and express promise and compact this be that which i think concern the begin of political societies and that consent which make any one a member of any commonwealth of the end of political society and government if man in the state of nature be so free as have be say if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions equal to the greatest and subject to nobody why will he part with his freedom this empire and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power to which it be obvious to answer that though in the state of nature he hath such a right yet the enjoyment of it be very uncertain and constantly expose to the invasion of others for all be kings as much as he every man his equal and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice the enjoyment of the property he have in this state be very unsafe very insecure this make him will to quit this condition which however free be full of fear and continual dangers and it be not without reason that he seek out and be will to join in society with others who be already unite or have a mind to unite for the mutual preservation of their live liberties and estates which i call by the general nameproperty the great and chief end therefore of men unite into commonwealths and put themselves under government be the preservation of their property to which in the state of nature there be many things want firstly there want an establish settle know law receive and allow by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong and the common measure to decide all controversies between them for though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures yet men be bias by their interest as well as ignorant for want of study of it be not apt to allow of it as a law bind to them in the application of it to their particular case secondly in the state of nature there want a know and indifferent judge with authority to determine all differences accord to the establish law for every one in that state be both judge and executioner of the law of nature men be partial to themselves passion and revenge be very apt to carry them too far and with too much heat in their own case as well as negligence and unconcernedness make them too remiss in other mens thirdly in the state of nature there often want power to back and support the sentence when right and to give it due execution they who by any injustice offend will seldom fail where they be able by force to make good their injustice such resistance many time make the punishment dangerous and frequently destructive to those who attempt it thus mankind notwithstanding all the privilege of the state of nature be but in an ill condition while they remain in it be quickly drive into society hence it come to pass that we seldom find any number of men live any time together in this state the inconveniencies that they be therein expose to by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the power every man have of punish the transgressions of others make them take sanctuary under the establish laws of government and therein seek the preservation of their property it be this that make them so willingly give up every one his single power of punish to be exercise by such alone as shall be appoint to it amongst them and by such rule as the community or those authorise by them to that purpose shall agree on and in this we have the original right and rise of both the legislative and executive power as well as of the governments and societies themselves for in the state of nature to omit the liberty he have of innocent delight a man have two power the first be to do whatsoever he think fit for the preservation of himself and others within the permission of the law of nature by which law common to them all he and all the rest of mankind be one community make up one society distinct from all other creatures and be it not for the corruption and viciousness of degenerate men there would be no need of any other no necessity that men should separate from this great and natural community and associate into lesser combinations the other power a man have in the state of nature be the power to punish the crimes commit against that law both these he give up when he join in a private if i may so call it or particular political society and incorporate into any commonwealth separate from the rest of mankind the first powerviz of do whatsoever he think fit for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind he give up to be regulate by laws make by the society so far forth as the preservation of himself and the rest of that society shall require which laws of the society in many things confine the liberty he have by the law of nature secondly the power of punish he wholly give up and engage his natural force which he might before employ in the execution of the law of nature by his own single authority as he think fit to assist the executive power of the society as the law thereof shall require for be now in a new state wherein he be to enjoy many conveniencies from the labour assistance and society of others in the same community as well as protection from its whole strength he be to part also with as much of his natural liberty in provide for himself as the good prosperity and safety of the society shall require which be not only necessary but just since the other members of the society do the like but though men when they enter into society give up the equality liberty and executive power they have in the state of nature into the hand of the society to be so far dispose of by the legislative as the good of the society shall require yet it be only with an intention in every one the better to preserve himself his liberty and property for no rational creature can be suppose to change his condition with an intention to be worse the power of the society or legislative constitute by them can never be suppose to extend farther than the common good but be oblige to secure every ones property by provide against those three defect above mention that make the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy and so whoever have the legislative or supreme power of any commonwealth be bind to govern by establish stand laws promulgate and know to the people and not by extemporary decree by indifferent and upright judge who be to decide controversies by those laws and to employ the force of the community at home only in the execution of such laws or abroad to prevent or redress foreign injuries and secure the community from inroads and invasion and all this to be direct to no other end but the peace safety and public good of the people of the form of a commonwealth the majority have as have be show upon mens first unite into society the whole power of the community naturally in them may employ all that power in make laws for the community from time to time and execute those laws by officer of their own appoint and then the form of the government be a perfect democracy or else may put the power of make laws into the hand of a few select men and their heirs or successors and then it be an oligarchy or else into the hand of one man and then it be a monarchy if to him and his heirs it be a hereditary monarchy if to him only for life but upon his death the power only of nominate a successor to return to them an elective monarchy and so accordingly of these make compound and mix form of government as they think good and if the legislative power be at first give by the majority to one or more persons only for their live or any limit time and then the supreme power to revert to them again when it be so revert the community may dispose of it again anew into what hand they please and so constitute a new form of government for the form of government depend upon the place the supreme power which be the legislative it be impossible to conceive that an inferior power should prescribe to a superior or any but the supreme make laws accord as the power of make laws be place such be the form of the commonwealth by commonwealth i must be understand all along to mean not a democracy or any form of government but any independent community which the latins signify by the word civitas to which the word which best answer in our language be commonwealth and most properly express such a society of men which community do not for there may be subordinate communities in a government and city much less and therefore to avoid ambiguity i crave leave to use the word commonwealth in that sense in which sense i find the word use by king jam himself which i think to be its genuine signification which if anybody dislike i consent with him to change it for a better of the extent of the legislative power the great end of mens enter into society be the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety and the great instrument and mean of that be the laws establish in that society the first and fundamental positive law of all commonwealths be the establish of the legislative power as the first and fundamental natural law which be to govern even the legislative itself be the preservation of the society and as far as will consist with the public good of every person in it this legislative be not only the supreme power of the commonwealth but sacred and unalterable in the hand where the community have once place it nor can any edict of anybody else in what form soever conceive or by what power soever back have the force and obligation of a law which have not its sanction from that legislative which the public have choose and appoint for without this the law could not have that which be absolutely necessary to its be a law the consent of the society over whom nobody can have a power to make laws but by their own consent and by authority receive from them and therefore all the obedience which by the most solemn tie any one can be oblige to pay ultimately terminate in this supreme power and be direct by those laws which it enact nor can any oaths to any foreign power whatsoever or any domestic subordinate power discharge any member of the society from his obedience to the legislative act pursuant to their trust nor oblige him to any obedience contrary to the laws so enact or farther than they do allow it be ridiculous to imagine one can be tie ultimately to obey any power in the society which be not the supreme though the legislative whether place in one or more whether it be always in be or only by intervals though it be the supreme power in every commonwealth yet first it be not nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the live and fortunes of the people for it be but the joint power of every member of the society give up to that person or assembly which be legislator it can be no more than those persons have in a state of nature before they enter into society and give it up to the community for nobody can transfer to another more power than he have in himself and nobody have an absolute arbitrary power over himself or over any other to destroy his own life or take away the life or property of another a man as have be prove can not subject himself to the arbitrary power of another and have in the state of nature no arbitrary power over the life liberty or possession of another but only so much as the law of nature give him for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind this be all he doth or can give up to the commonwealth and by it to the legislative power so that the legislative can have no more than this their power in the utmost bound of it be limit to the public good of the society it be a power that hath no other end but preservation and therefore can never have a right to destroy enslave or designedly to impoverish the subject the obligations of the law of nature cease not in society but only in many case be draw closer and have by human laws know penalties annex to them to enforce their observation thus the law of nature stand as an eternal rule to all men legislators as well as others the rule that they make for other mens action must as well as their own and other mens action be conformable to the law of nature ie to the will of god of which that be a declaration and the fundamental law of nature be the preservation of mankind no human sanction can be good or valid against it secondly the legislative or supreme authority can not assume to itself a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decree but be bind to dispense justice and decide the right of the subject by promulgate stand laws and know authorise judge for the law of nature be unwritten and so nowhere to be find but in the mind of men they who through passion or interest shall miscite or misapply it can not so easily be convince of their mistake where there be no establish judge and so it serve not as it aught to determine the right and fence the properties of those that live under it especially where every one be judge interpreter and executioner of it too and that in his own case and he that have right on his side have ordinarily but his own single strength hath not force enough to defend himself from injuries or punish delinquents to avoid these inconveniencies which disorder mens properties in the state of nature men unite into societies that they may have the unite strength of the whole society to secure and defend their properties and may have stand rule to bind it by which every one may know what be his to this end it be that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into and the community put the legislative power into such hand as they think fit with this trust that they shall be govern by declare laws or else their peace quiet and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it be in the state of nature absolute arbitrary power or govern without settle stand laws can neither of them consist with the end of society and government which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for and tie themselves up under be it not to preserve their live liberties and fortunes and by state rule of right and property to secure their peace and quiet it can not be suppose that they should intend have they a power so to do to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates and put a force into the magistrates hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them this be to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature wherein they have a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others and be upon equal term of force to maintain it whether invade by a single man or many in combination whereas by suppose they have give up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator they have disarm themselves and arm him to make a prey of them when he please he be in a much worse condition that be expose to the arbitrary power of one man who have the command of a hundred thousand than he that be expose to the arbitrary power of a hundred thousand single men nobody be secure that his will who have such a command be better than that of other men though his force be a hundred thousand time stronger and therefore whatever form the commonwealth be under the rule power ought to govern by declare and receive laws and not by extemporary dictate and undetermined resolutions for then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature if they shall have arm one or a few men with the joint power of a multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decree of their sudden thoughts or unrestrained and till that moment unknown will without have any measure set down which may guide and justify their action for all the power the government have be only for the good of the society as it ought not to be arbitrary and at pleasure so it ought to be exercise by establish and promulgate laws that both the people may know their duty and be safe and secure within the limit of the law and the rulers too keep within their due bound and not be tempt by the power they have in their hand to employ it to purpose and by such measure as they would not have know and own not willingly thirdly the supreme power can not take from any man any part of his property without his own consent for the preservation of property be the end of government and that for which men enter into society it necessarily suppose and require that the people should have property without which they must be suppose to lose that by enter into society which be the end for which they enter into it too gross an absurdity for any man to own men therefore in society have property they have such a right to the goods which by the law of the community be theirs that nobody hath a right to take them or any part of them from them without their own consent without this they have no property at all for i have truly no property in that which another can by right take from me when he please against my consent hence it be a mistake to think that the supreme or legislative power of any commonwealth can do what it will and dispose of the estates of the subject arbitrarily or take any part of them at pleasure this be not much to be fear in governments where the legislative consist wholly or in part in assemblies which be variable whose members upon the dissolution of the assembly be subject under the common laws of their country equally with the rest but in governments where the legislative be in one last assembly always in be or in one man as in absolute monarchies there be danger still that they will think themselves to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community and so will be apt to increase their own riches and power by take what they think fit from the people for a man property be not at all secure though there be good and equitable laws to set the bound of it between him and his fellowsubjects if he who command those subject have power to take from any private man what part he please of his property and use and dispose of it as he think good but government into whosesoever hand it be put be as i have before show entrust with this condition and for this end that men might have and secure their properties the prince or senate however it may have power to make laws for the regulate of property between the subject one amongst another yet can never have a power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the subject property without their own consent for this would be in effect to leave them no property at all and to let us see that even absolute power where it be necessary be not arbitrary by be absolute but be still limit by that reason and confine to those end which require it in some case to be absolute we need look no farther than the common practice of martial discipline for the preservation of the army and in it of the whole commonwealth require an absolute obedience to the command of every superior officer and it be justly death to disobey or dispute the most dangerous or unreasonable of them but yet we see that neither the sergeant that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a cannon or stand in a breach where he be almost sure to perish can command that soldier to give him one penny of his money nor the general that can condemn him to death for desert his post or not obey the most desperate order can not yet with all his absolute power of life and death dispose of one farthing of that soldier estate or seize one jot of his goods whom yet he can command anything and hang for the least disobedience because such a blind obedience be necessary to that end for which the commander have his powerviz the preservation of the rest but the dispose of his goods have nothing to do with it it be true governments can not be support without great charge and it be fit every one who enjoy his share of the protection should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it but still it must be with his own consentie the consent of the majority give it either by themselves or their representatives choose by them for if any one shall claim a power to lay and levy tax on the people by his own authority and without such consent of the people he thereby invade the fundamental law of property and subvert the end of government for what property have i in that which another may by right take when he please to himself fourthly the legislative can not transfer the power of make laws to any other hand for it be but a delegate power from the people they who have it can not pass it over to others the people alone can appoint the form of the commonwealth which be by constitute the legislative and appoint in whose hand that shall be and when the people have say we will submit and be govern by laws make by such men and in such form nobody else can say other men shall make laws for them nor can they be bind by any laws but such as be enact by those whom they have choose and authorise to make laws for them these be the bound which the trust that be put in them by the society and the law of god and nature have set to the legislative power of every commonwealth in all form of government first they be to govern by promulgate establish laws not to be vary in particular case but to have one rule for rich and poor for the favourite at court and the countryman at plough secondly these laws also ought to be design for no other end ultimately but the good of the people thirdly they must not raise tax on the property of the people without the consent of the people give by themselves or their deputies and this properly concern only such governments where the legislative be always in be or at least where the people have not reserve any part of the legislative to deputies to be from time to time choose by themselves fourthly legislative neither must nor can transfer the power of make laws to anybody else or place it anywhere but where the people have the legislative executive and federative power of the commonwealth the legislative power be that which have a right to direct how the force of the commonwealth shall be employ for preserve the community and the members of it because those laws which be constantly to be execute and whose force be always to continue may be make in a little time therefore there be no need that the legislative should be always in be not have always business to do and because it may be too great temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power for the same persons who have the power of make laws to have also in their hand the power to execute them whereby they may exempt themselves from obedience to the laws they make and suit the law both in its make and execution to their own private advantage and thereby come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community contrary to the end of society and government therefore in wellordered commonwealths where the good of the whole be so consider as it ought the legislative power be put into the hand of divers persons who duly assemble have by themselves or jointly with others a power to make laws which when they have do be separate again they be themselves subject to the laws they have make which be a new and near tie upon them to take care that they make them for the public good but because the laws that be at once and in a short time make have a constant and last force and need a perpetual execution or an attendance thereunto therefore it be necessary there should be a power always in be which should see to the execution of the laws that be make and remain in force and thus the legislative and executive power come often to be separate there be another power in every commonwealth which one may call natural because it be that which answer to the power every man naturally have before he enter into society for though in a commonwealth the members of it be distinct persons still in reference to one another and as such be govern by the laws of the society yet in reference to the rest of mankind they make one body which be as every member of it before be still in the state of nature with the rest of mankind so that the controversies that happen between any man of the society with those that be out of it be manage by the public and an injury do to a member of their body engage the whole in the reparation of it so that under this consideration the whole community be one body in the state of nature in respect of all other state or persons out of its community this therefore contain the power of war and peace league and alliances and all the transactions with all persons and communities without the commonwealth and may be call federative if any one please so the thing be understand i be indifferent as to the name these two power executive and federative though they be really distinct in themselves yet one comprehend the execution of the municipal laws of the society within itself upon all that be part of it the other the management of the security and interest of the public without with all those that it may receive benefit or damage from yet they be always almost unite and though this federative power in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the commonwealth yet it be much less capable to be direct by antecedent stand positive laws than the executive and so must necessarily be leave to the prudence and wisdom of those whose hand it be in to be manage for the public good for the laws that concern subject one amongst another be to direct their action may well enough precede them but what be to be do in reference to foreigners depend much upon their action and the variation of design and interest must be leave in great part to the prudence of those who have this power commit to them to be manage by the best of their skill for the advantage of the commonwealth though as i say the executive and federative power of every community be really distinct in themselves yet they be hardly to be separate and place at the same time in the hand of distinct persons for both of them require the force of the society for their exercise it be almost impracticable to place the force of the commonwealth in distinct and not subordinate hand or that the executive and federative power should be place in persons that might act separately whereby the force of the public would be under different command which would be apt some time or other to cause disorder and ruin of the subordination of the power of the commonwealth though in a constitute commonwealth stand upon its own basis and act accord to its own naturethat be act for the preservation of the community there can be but one supreme power which be the legislative to which all the rest be and must be subordinate yet the legislative be only a fiduciary power to act for certain end there remain still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust repose in them for all power give with trust for the attain an end be limit by that end whenever that end be manifestly neglect or oppose the trust must necessarily be forfeit and the power devolve into the hand of those that give it who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security and thus the community perpetually retain a supreme power of save themselves from the attempt and design of anybody even of their legislators whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked as to lay and carry on design against the liberties and properties of the subject for no man or society of men have a power to deliver up their preservation or consequently the mean of it to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion of another whenever any one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition they will always have a right to preserve what they have not a power to part with and to rid themselves of those who invade this fundamental sacred and unalterable law of selfpreservation for which they enter into society and thus the community may be say in this respect to be always the supreme power but not as consider under any form of government because this power of the people can never take place till the government be dissolve in all case whilst the government subsist the legislative be the supreme power for what can give laws to another must need be superior to him and since the legislative be no otherwise legislative of the society but by the right it have to make laws for all the part and every member of the society prescribe rule to their action they be transgress the legislative must need be the supreme and all other power in any members or part of the society derive from and subordinate to it in some commonwealths where the legislative be not always in be and the executive be vest in a single person who have also a share in the legislative there that single person in a very tolerable sense may also be call supreme not that he have in himself all the supreme power which be that of lawmaking but because he have in him the supreme execution from whom all inferior magistrates derive all their several subordinate power or at least the greatest part of them have also no legislative superior to him there be no law to be make without his consent which can not be expect should ever subject him to the other part of the legislative he be properly enough in this sense supreme but yet it be to be observe that though oaths of allegiance and fealty be take to him it be not to him as supreme legislator but as supreme executor of the law make by a joint power of him with others allegiance be nothing but an obedience accord to law which when he violate he have no right to obedience nor can claim it otherwise than as the public person vest with the power of the law and so be to be consider as the image phantom or representative of the commonwealth act by the will of the society declare in its laws and thus he have no will no power but that of the law but when he quit this representa tion this public will and act by his own private will he degrade himself and be but a single private person without power and without will the members owe no obedience but to the public will of the society the executive power place anywhere but in a person that have also a share in the legislative be visibly subordinate and accountable to it and may be at pleasure change and displace so that it be not the supreme executive power that be exempt from subordination but the supreme executive power vest in one who have a share in the legislative have no distinct superior legislative to be subordinate and accountable to farther than he himself shall join and consent so that he be no more subordinate than he himself shall think fit which one may certainly conclude will be but very little of other ministerial and subordinate power in a commonwealth we need not speak they be so multiply with infinite variety in the different customs and constitutions of distinct commonwealths that it be impossible to give a particular account of them all only thus much which be necessary to our present purpose we may take notice of concern them that they have no manner of authority any of them beyond what be by positive grant and commission delegate to them and be all of them accountable to some other power in the commonwealth it be not necessaryno nor so much as convenientthat the legislative should be always in be but absolutely necessary that the executive power should because there be not always need of new laws to be make but always need of execution of the laws that be make when the legislative hath put the execution of the laws they make into other hand they have a power still to resume it out of those hand when they find cause and to punish for any maladministration against the laws the same hold also in regard of the federative power that and the executive be both ministerial and subordinate to the legislative which as have be show in a constitute commonwealth be the supreme the legislative also in this case be suppose to consist of several persons for if it be a single person it can not but be always in be and so will as supreme naturally have the supreme executive power together with the legislative may assemble and exercise their legislative at the time that either their original constitution or their own adjournment appoint or when they please if neither of these hath appoint any time or there be no other way prescribe to convoke them for the supreme power be place in them by the people it be always in them and they may exercise it when they please unless by their original constitution they be limit to certain season or by an act of their supreme power they have adjourn to a certain time and when that time come they have a right to assemble and act again if the legislative or any part of it be of representatives choose for that time by the people which afterwards return into the ordinary state of subject and have no share in the legislative but upon a new choice this power of choose must also be exercise by the people either at certain appoint season or else when they be summon to it and in this latter case the power of convoke the legislative be ordinarily place in the executive and have one of these two limitations in respect of timethat either the original constitution require their assemble and act at certain intervals and then the executive power do nothing but ministerially issue directions for their elect and assemble accord to due form or else it be leave to his prudence to call them by new elections when the occasion or exigencies of the public require the amendment of old or make of new laws or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies that lie on or threaten the people it may be demand here what if the executive power be possess of the force of the commonwealth shall make use of that force to hinder the meet and act of the legislative when the original constitution or the public exigencies require it i say use force upon the people without authority and contrary to the trust put in him that do so be a state of war with the people who have a right to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power for have erect a legislative with an intent they should exercise the power of make laws either at certain set time or when there be need of it when they be hinder by any force from what be so necessary to the society and wherein the safety and preservation of the people consist the people have a right to remove it by force in all state and condition the true remedy of force without authority be to oppose force to it the use of force without authority always put him that use it into a state of war as the aggressor and render him liable to be treat accordingly the power of assemble and dismiss the legislative place in the executive give not the executive a superiority over it but be a fiduciary trust place in him for the safety of the people in a case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affairs could not bear a steady fix rule for it not be possible that the first framers of the government should by any foresight be so much master of future events as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and duration to the assemblies of the legislative in all time to come that might exactly answer all the exigencies of the commonwealth the best remedy could be find for this defect be to trust this to the prudence of one who be always to be present and whose business it be to watch over the public good constant frequent meet of the legislative and long continuations of their assemblies without necessary occasion could not but be burdensome to the people and must necessarily in time produce more dangerous inconveniencies and yet the quick turn of affairs might be sometimes such as to need their present help any delay of their convene might endanger the public and sometimes too their business might be so great that the limit time of their sit might be too short for their work and rob the public of that benefit which could be have only from their mature deliberation what then could be do in this case to prevent the community from be expose some time or other to imminent hazard on one side or the other by fix intervals and periods set to the meet and act of the legislative but to entrust it to the prudence of some who be present and acquaint with the state of public affairs might make use of this prerogative for the public good and where else could this be so well place as in his hand who be entrust with the execution of the laws for the same end thus suppose the regulation of time for the assemble and sit of the legislative not settle by the original constitution it naturally fell into the hand of the executive not as an arbitrary power depend on his good pleasure but with this trust always to have it exercise only for the public weal as the occurrences of time and change of affairs might require whether settle periods of their convene or a liberty leave to the prince for convoke the legislative or perhaps a mixture of both hath the least inconvenience attend it it be not my business here to inquire but only to show that though the executive power may have the prerogative of convoke and dissolve such conventions of the legislative yet it be not thereby superior to it things of this world be in so constant a flux that nothing remain long in the same state thus people riches trade power change their station flourish mighty cities come to ruin and prove in time neglect desolate corner whilst other unfrequented place grow into populous countries fill with wealth and inhabitants but things not always change equally and private interest often keep up customs and privilege when the reason of them be cease it often come to pass that in governments where part of the legislative consist of repre sentatives choose by the people that in tract of time this representation become very unequal and disproportionate to the reason it be at first establish upon to what gross absurdities the follow of custom when reason have leave it may lead we may be satisfy when we see the bare name of a town of which there remain not so much as the ruin where scarce so much house as a sheepcote or more inhabitants than a shepherd be to be find send as many representatives to the grand assembly of lawmakers as a whole county numerous in people and powerful in riches this strangers stand amaze at and every one must confess need a remedy though most think it hard to find one because the constitution of the legislative be the original and supreme act of the society antecedent to all positive laws in it and depend wholly on the people no inferior power can alter it and therefore the people when the legislative be once constitute have in such a government as we have be speak of no power to act as long as the government stand this inconvenience be think incapable of a remedy salus populi suprema lex be certainly so just and fundamental a rule that he who sincerely follow it can not dangerously err if therefore the executive who have the power of convoke the legislative observe rather the true proportion than fashion of representation regulate not by old custom but true reason the number of members in all place that have a right to be distinctly represent which no part of the people however incorporate can pretend to but in proportion to the assistance which it afford to the public it can not be judge to have set up a new legislative but to have restore the old and true one and to have rectify the disorder which succession of time have insensibly as well as inevitably introduce for it be the interest as well as intention of the people to have a fair and equal representative whoever bring it nearest to that be an undoubted friend to and establisher of the government and can not miss the consent and approbation of the community prerogative be nothing but a power in the hand of the prince to provide for the public good in such case which depend upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences certain and unalterable laws could not safely direct whatsoever shall be do manifestly for the good of the people and establish the government upon its true foundations be and always will be just prerogative the power of erect new corporations and therewith new representatives carry with it a supposition that in time the measure of representation might vary and those have a just right to be represent which before have none and by the same reason those cease to have a right and be too inconsiderable for such a privilege which before have it it be not a change from the present state which perhaps corruption or decay have introduce that make an inroad upon the government but the tendency of it to injure or oppress the people and to set up one part or party with a distinction from and an unequal subjection of the rest whatsoever can not but be acknowledge to be of advantage to the society and people in general upon just and last measure will always when do justify itself and whenever the people shall choose their representatives upon just and undeniably equal measure suitable to the original frame of the government it can not be doubt to be the will and act of the society whoever permit or propose to them so to do of prerogative where the legislative and executive power be in distinct hand as they be in all moderate monarchies and wellframed governments there the good of the society require that several things should be leave to the discretion of him that have the executive power for the legislators not be able to foresee and provide by laws for all that may be useful to the community the executor of the laws have the power in his hand have by the common law of nature a right to make use of it for the good of the society in many case where the municipal law have give no direction till the legislative can conveniently be assemble to provide for it nay many things there be which the law can by no mean provide for and those must necessarily be leave to the discretion of him that have the executive power in his hand to be order by him as the public good and advantage shall require nay it be fit that the laws themselves should in some case give way to the executive power or rather to this fundamental law of nature and governmentviz that as much as may be all the members of the society be to be preserve for since many accidents may happen wherein a strict and rigid observation of the laws may do harm as not to pull down an innocent man house to stop the fire when the next to it be burn and a man may come sometimes within the reach of the law which make no distinction of persons by an action that may deserve reward and pardon it be fit the ruler should have a power in many case to mitigate the severity of the law and pardon some offenders since the end of government be the preservation of all as much as may be even the guilty be to be spar where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent this power to act accord to discretion for the public good without the prescription of the law and sometimes even against it be that which be call prerogative for since in some governments the lawmaking power be not always in be and be usually too numerous and so too slow for the dispatch requisite to execution and because also it be impossible to foresee and so by laws to provide for all accidents and necessities that may concern the public or make such laws as will do no harm if they be execute with an inflexible rigour on all occasion and upon all persons that may come in their way therefore there be a latitude leave to the executive power to do many things of choice which the laws do not prescribe this power whilst employ for the benefit of the community and suitably to the trust and end of the government be undoubted prerogative and never be question for the people be very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the point or question of prerogative whilst it be in any tolerable degree employ for the use it be meantthat be the good of the people and not manifestly against it but if there come to be a question between the executive power and the people about a thing claim as a prerogative the tendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the people will easily decide that question it be easy to conceive that in the infancy of governments when commonwealths differ little from families in number of people they differ from them too but little in number of laws and the governors be as the father of them watch over them for their good the government be almost all prerogative a few establish laws serve the turn and the discretion and care of the ruler supple the rest but when mistake or flattery prevail with weak princes to make use of this power for private end of their own and not for the public good the people be fain by express laws to get prerogative determine in those point wherein they find disadvantage from it and declare limitations of prerogative in those case which they and their ancestors have leave in the utmost latitude to the wisdom of those princes who make no other but a right use of itthat be for the good of their people and therefore they have a very wrong notion of government who say that the people have encroach upon the prerogative when they have get any part of it to be define by positive laws for in so do they have not pull from the prince anything that of right be long to him but only declare that that power which they indefinitely leave in his or his ancestors hand to be exercise for their good be not a thing they intend him when he use it otherwise for the end of government be the good of the community whatsoever alterations be make in it tend to that end can not be an encroachment upon anybody since nobody in government can have a right tend to any other end and those only be encroachments which prejudice or hinder the public good those who say otherwise speak as if the prince have a distinct and separate interest from the good of the community and be not make for it the root and source from which spring almost all those evils and disorder which happen in kingly governments and indeed if that be so the people under his government be not a society of rational creatures enter into a community for their mutual good such as have set rulers over themselves to guard and promote that good but be to be look on as a herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a master who keep them and work them for his own pleasure or profit if men be so void of reason and brutish as to enter into society upon such term prerogative might indeed be what some men would have it an arbitrary power to do things hurtful to the people but since a rational creature can not be suppose when free to put himself into subjection to another for his own harm though where he find a good and a wise ruler he may not perhaps think it either necessary or useful to set precise bound to his power in all things prerogative can be nothing but the people permit their rulers to do several things of their own free choice where the law be silent and sometimes too against the direct letter of the law for the public good and their acquiesce in it when so do for as a good prince who be mindful of the trust put into his hand and careful of the good of his people can not have too much prerogative that be power to do good so a weak and ill prince who would claim that power his predecessors exercise without the direction of the law as a prerogative belong to him by right of his office which he may exercise at his pleasure to make or promote an interest distinct from that of the public give the people an occasion to claim their right and limit that power which whilst it be exercise for their good they be content should be tacitly allow and therefore he that will look into the history of england will find that prerogative be always largest in the hand of our wisest and best princes because the people observe the whole tendency of their action to be the public good or if any human frailty or mistake for princes be but men make as others appear in some small declinations from that end yet it be visible the main of their conduct tend to nothing but the care of the public the people therefore find reason to be satisfy with these princes whenever they act without or contrary to the letter of the law acquiesce in what they do and without the least complaint let them enlarge their prerogative as they please judge rightly that they do nothing herein to the prejudice of their laws since they act conformably to the foundation and end of all lawsthe public good such godlike princes indeed have some title to arbitrary power by that argument that would prove absolute monarchy the best government as that which god himself govern the universe by because such kings partake of his wisdom and goodness upon this be found that say that the reign of good princes have be always most dangerous to the liberties of their people for when their successors manage the government with different thoughts would draw the action of those good rulers into precedent and make them the standard of their prerogativeas if what have be do only for the good of the people be a right in them to do for the harm of the people if they so please it have often occasion contest and sometimes public disorder before the people could recover their original right and get that to be declare not to be prerogative which truly be never so since it be impossible anybody in the society should ever have a right to do the people harm though it be very possible and reasonable that the people should not go about to set any bound to the prerogative of those kings or rulers who themselves transgress not the bound of the public good for prerogative be nothing but the power of do public good without a rule the power of call parliaments in england as to precise time place and duration be certainly a prerogative of the king but still with this trust that it shall be make use of for the good of the nation as the exigencies of the time and variety of occasion shall require for it be impossible to foresee which should always be the fittest place for them to assemble in and what the best season the choice of these be leave with the executive power as might be best subservient to the public good and best suit the end of parliament the old question will be ask in this matter of prerogative but who shall be judge when this power be make a right use of i answer between an executive power in be with such a prerogative and a legislative that depend upon his will for their convene there can be no judge on earth as there can be none between the legislative and the people should either the executive or the legislative when they have get the power in their hand design or go about to enslave or destroy them the people have no other remedy in this as in all other case where they have no judge on earth but to appeal to heaven for the rulers in such attempt exercise a power the people never put into their hand who can never be suppose to consent that anybody should rule over them for their harm do that which they have not a right to do and where the body of the people or any single man be deprive of their right or be under the exercise of a power without right have no appeal on earth they have a liberty to appeal to heaven whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment and therefore though the people can not be judge so as to have by the constitution of that society any superior power to determine and give effective sentence in the case yet they have reserve that ultimate determination to themselves which belong to all mankind where there lie no appeal on earth by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven and this judgement they can not part with it be out of a man power so to submit himself to another as to give him a liberty to destroy him god and nature never allow a man so to abandon himself as to neglect his own preservation and since he can not take away his own life neither can he give another power to take it nor let any one think this lay a perpetual foundation for disorder for this operate not till the inconvenience be so great that the majority feel it and be weary of it and find a necessity to have it amend and this the executive power or wise princes never need come in the danger of and it be the thing of all others they have most need to avoid as of all others the most perilous of paternal political and despotical power consider together though i have have occasion to speak of these separately before yet the great mistake of late about government have as i suppose arise from confound these distinct power one with another it may not perhaps be amiss to consider them here together first then paternal or parental power be nothing but that which parent have over their children to govern them for the childrens good till they come to the use of reason or a state of knowledge wherein they may be suppose capable to understand that rule whether it be the law of nature or the municipal law of their country they be to govern themselves bycapable i say to know it as well as several others who live as free men under that law the affection and tenderness god hath plant in the breast of parent towards their children make it evident that this be not intend to be a severe arbitrary government but only for the help instruction and preservation of their offspring but happen as it will there be as i have prove no reason why it should be think to extend to life and death at any time over their children more than over anybody else or keep the child in subjection to the will of his parent when grow to a man and the perfect use of reason any farther than as have receive life and education from his parent oblige him to respect honour gratitude assistance and support all his life to both father and mother and thus it be true the paternal be a natural government but not at all extend itself to the end and jurisdictions of that which be political the power of the father doth not reach at all to the property of the child which be only in his own dispose secondly political power be that power which every man have in the state of nature have give up into the hand of the society and therein to the governors whom the society hath set over itself with this express or tacit trust that it shall be employ for their good and the preservation of their property now this power which every man have in the state of nature and which he part with to the society in all such case where the society can secure him be to use such mean for the preserve of his own property as he think good and nature allow him and to punish the breach of the law of nature in others so as accord to the best of his reason may most conduce to the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind so that the end and measure of this power when in every man hand in the state of nature be the preservation of all of his societythat be all mankind in generalit can have no other end or measure when in the hand of the magistrate but to preserve the members of that society in their live liberties and possessions and so can not be an absolute arbitrary power over their live and fortunes which be as much as possible to be preserve but a power to make laws and annex such penalties to them as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cut off those part and those only which be so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy without which no severity be lawful and this power have its original only from compact and agreement and the mutual consent of those who make up the community thirdly despotical power be an absolute arbitrary power one man have over another to take away his life whenever he please and this be a power which neither nature give for it have make no such distinction between one man and another nor compact can convey for man not have such an arbitrary power over his own life can not give another man such a power over it but it be the effect only of forfeiture which the aggressor make of his own life when he put himself into the state of war with another for have quit reason which god hath give to be the rule betwixt man and man and the peaceable ways which that teach and make use of force to compass his unjust end upon another where he have no right he render himself liable to be destroy by his adversary whenever he can as any other noxious and brutish creature that be destructive to his be and thus captives take in a just and lawful war and such only be subject to a despotical power which as it arise not from compact so neither be it capable of any but be the state of war continue for what compact can be make with a man that be not master of his own life what condition can he perform and if he be once allow to be master of his own life the despotical arbitrary power of his master cease he that be master of himself and his own life have a right too to the mean of preserve it so that as soon as compact enter slavery cease and he so far quit his absolute power and put an end to the state of war who enter into condition with his captive nature give the first of theseviz paternal power to parent for the benefit of their children during their minority to supply their want of ability and understand how to manage their property by property i must be understand here as in other place to mean that property which men have in their persons as well as goods voluntary agreement give the secondviz political power to governors for the benefit of their subject to secure them in the possession and use of their properties and forfeiture give the thirddespotical power to lord for their own benefit over those who be strip of all property he that shall consider the distinct rise and extent and the different end of these several power will plainly see that paternal power come as far short of that of the magistrate as despotical exceed it and that absolute dominion however place be so far from be one kind of civil society that it be as inconsistent with it as slavery be with property paternal power be only where minority make the child incapable to manage his property political where men have property in their own disposal and despotical over such as have no property at all of conquest though governments can originally have no other rise than that before mention nor polities be found on anything but the consent of the people yet such have be the disorder ambition have fill the world with that in the noise of war which make so great a part of the history of mankind this consent be little take notice of and therefore many have mistake the force of arm for the consent of the people and reckon conquest as one of the originals of government but conquest be as far from set up any government as demolish a house be from build a new one in the place indeed it often make way for a new frame of a commonwealth by destroy the former but without the consent of the people can never erect a new one that the aggressor who put himself into the state of war with another and unjustly invade another man right can by such an unjust war never come to have a right over the conquer will be easily agree by all men who will not think that robbers and pirate have a right of empire over whomsoever they have force enough to master or that men be bind by promise which unlawful force extort from them should a robber break into my house and with a dagger at my throat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him would this give him any title just such a title by his sword have an unjust conqueror who force me into submission the injury and the crime be equal whether commit by the wearer of a crown or some petty villain the title of the offender and the number of his followers make no difference in the offence unless it be to aggravate it the only difference be great robbers punish little ones to keep them in their obedience but the great ones be reward with laurels and triumph because they be too big for the weak hand of justice in this world and have the power in their own possession which should punish offenders what be my remedy against a robber that so break into my house appeal to the law for justice but perhaps justice be deny or i be cripple and can not stir rob and have not the mean to do it if god have take away all mean of seek remedy there be nothing leave but patience but my son when able may seek the relief of the law which i be deny he or his son may renew his appeal till he recover his right but the conquer or their children have no courtno arbitrator on earth to appeal to then they may appeal as jephtha do to heaven and repeat their appeal till they have recover the native right of their ancestors which be to have such a legislative over them as the majority should approve and freely acquiesce in if it be object this would cause endless trouble i answer no more than justice do where she lie open to all that appeal to her he that trouble his neighbour without a cause be punish for it by the justice of the court he appeal to and he that appeal to heaven must be sure he have right on his side and a right too that be worth the trouble and cost of the appeal as he will answer at a tribunal that can not be deceive and will be sure to retribute to every one accord to the mischiefs he hath create to his fellowsubjectsthat be any part of mankind from whence it be plain that he that conquer in an unjust war can thereby have no title to the subjection and obedience of the conquer but suppose victory favour the right side let us consider a conqueror in a lawful war and see what power he get and over whom first it be plain he get no power by his conquest over those that conquer with him they that fight on his side can not suffer by the conquest but must at least be as much free men as they be before and most commonly they serve upon term and on condition to share with their leader and enjoy a part of the spoil and other advantage that attend the conquer sword or at least have a part of the subdue country bestow upon them and the conquer people be not i hope to be slave by conquest and wear their laurels only to show they be sacrifice to their leaders triumph they that find absolute monarchy upon the title of the sword make their heroes who be the founder of such monarchies arrant drawcansirs and forget they have any officer and soldier that fight on their side in the battle they win or assist them in the subdue or share in possess the countries they master we be tell by some that the english monarchy be found in the norman conquest and that our princes have thereby a title to absolute dominion which if it be true as by the history it appear otherwise and that william have a right to make war on this island yet his dominion by conquest could reach no farther than to the saxons and britons that be then inhabitants of this country the normans that come with him and help to conquer and all descend from them be free men and no subject by conquest let that give what dominion it will and if i or anybody else shall claim freedom as derive from them it will be very hard to prove the contrary and it be plain the law that have make no distinction between the one and the other intend not there should be any difference in their freedom or privilege but suppose which seldom happen that the conquerors and conquer never incorporate into one people under the same laws and freedom let us see next what power a lawful conqueror have over the subdue and that i say be purely despotical he have an absolute power over the live of those who by an unjust war have forfeit them but not over the live or fortunes of those who engage not in the war nor over the possessions even of those who be actually engage in it secondly i say then the conqueror get no power but only over those who have actually assist concur or consent to that unjust force that be use against him for the people have give to their governors no power to do an unjust thing such as be to make an unjust war for they never have such a power in themselves they ought not to be charge as guilty of the violence and injustice that be commit in an unjust war any farther than they actually abet it no more than they be to be think guilty of any violence or oppression their governors should use upon the people themselves or any part of their fellowsubjects they have empower them no more to the one than to the other conquerors it be true seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction but they willingly permit the confusion of war to sweep all together but yet this alter not the right for the conquerors power over the live of the conquer be only because they have use force to do or maintain an injustice he can have that power only over those who have concur in that force all the rest be innocent and he have no more title over the people of that country who have do him no injury and so have make no forfeiture of their live than he have over any other who without any injuries or provocations have live upon fair term with him thirdly the power a conqueror get over those he overcome in a just war be perfectly despotical he have an absolute power over the live of those who by put themselves in a state of war have forfeit them but he have not thereby a right and title to their possessions this i doubt not but at first sight will seem a strange doctrine it be so quite contrary to the practice of the world there be nothing more familiar in speak of the dominion of countries than to say such an one conquer it as if conquest without any more ado convey a right of possession but when we consider that the practice of the strong and powerful how universal soever it may be be seldom the rule of right however it be one part of the subjection of the conquer not to argue against the condition cut out to them by the conquer swords though in all war there be usually a complication of force and damage and the aggressor seldom fail to harm the estate when he use force against the persons of those he make war upon yet it be the use of force only that put a man into the state of war for whether by force he begin the injury or else have quietly and by fraud do the injury he refuse to make reparation and by force maintain it which be the same thing as at first to have do it by force it be the unjust use of force that make the war for he that break open my house and violently turn me out of doors or have peaceably get in by force keep me out do in effect the same thing suppose we be in such a state that we have no common judge on earth whom i may appeal to and to whom we be both oblige to submit for of such i be now speak it be the unjust use of force then that put a man into the state of war with another and thereby he that be guilty of it make a forfeiture of his life for quit reason which be the rule give between man and man and use force the way of beasts he become liable to be destroy by him he use force against as any savage ravenous beast that be dangerous to his be but because the miscarriages of the father be no fault of the children who may be rational and peaceable notwithstanding the brutishness and injustice of the father the father by his miscarriages and violence can forfeit but his own life and involve not his children in his guilt or destruction his goods which nature that willeth the preservation of all mankind as much as be possible hath make to belong to the children to keep them from perish do still continue to belong to his children for suppose them not to have join in the war either through infancy or choice they have do nothing to forfeit them nor have the conqueror any right to take them away by the bare right of have subdue him that by force attempt his destruction though perhaps he may have some right to them to repair the damage he have sustain by the war and the defence of his own right which how far it reach to the possessions of the conquer we shall see byandby so that he that by conquest have a right over a man person to destroy him if he please have not thereby a right over his estate to possess and enjoy it for it be the brutal force the aggressor have use that give his adversary a right to take away his life and destroy him if he please as a noxious creature but it be damage sustain that alone give him title to another man goods for though i may kill a thief that set on me in the highway yet i may not which seem less take away his money and let him go this would be robbery on my side his force and the state of war he put himself in make him forfeit his life but give me no title to his goods the right then of conquest extend only to the live of those who join in the war but not to their estates but only in order to make reparation for the damage receive and the charge of the war and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and children let the conqueror have as much justice on his side as could be suppose he have no right to seize more than the vanquish could forfeit his life be at the victors mercy and his service and goods he may appropriate to make himself reparation but he can not take the goods of his wife and children they too have a title to the goods he enjoy and their share in the estate he possess for example i in the state of nature and all commonwealths be in the state of nature one with another have injure another man and refuse to give satisfaction it be come to a state of war wherein my defend by force what i have get unjustly make me the aggressor i be conquer my life it be true as forfeit be at mercy but not my wifes and childrens they make not the war nor assist in it i could not forfeit their live they be not mine to forfeit my wife have a share in my estate that neither could i forfeit and my children also be bear of me have a right to be maintain out of my labour or substance here then be the case the conqueror have a title to reparation for damage receive and the children have a title to their father estate for their subsistence for as to the wifes share whether her own labour or compact give her a title to it it be plain her husband could not forfeit what be hers what must be do in the case i answer the fundamental law of nature be that all as much as may be should be preserve it follow that if there be not enough fully to satisfy bothviz for the conquerors losses and childrens maintenance he that hath and to spare must remit something of his full satisfaction and give way to the press and preferable title of those who be in danger to perish without it but suppose the charge and damage of the war be to be make up to the conqueror to the utmost farthing and that the children of the vanquish spoil of all their father goods be to be leave to starve and perish yet the satisfy of what shall on this score be due to the conqueror will scarce give him a title to any country he shall conquer for the damage of war can scarce amount to the value of any considerable tract of land in any part of the world where all the land be possess and none lie waste and if i have not take away the conquerors land which be vanquish it be impossible i should scarce any other spoil i have do him can amount to the value of mine suppose it of an extent any way come near what i have overrun of his and equally cultivate too the destruction of a years product or two for it seldom reach four or five be the utmost spoil that usually can be do for as to money and such riches and treasure take away these be none of natures goods they have but a phantastical imaginary value nature have put no such upon them they be of no more account by her standard than the wampompeke of the americans to an european prince or the silver money of europe would have be formerly to an american and five years product be not worth the perpetual inheritance of land where all be possess and none remain waste to be take up by him that be disseised which will be easily grant if one do but take away the imaginary value of money the disproportion be more than between five and five thousand though at the same time half a years product be more worth than the inheritance where there be more land than the inhabitants possess and make use of any one have liberty to make use of the waste but their conquerors take little care to possess themselves of the land of the vanquish no damage therefore that men in the state of nature as all princes and governments be in reference to one another suffer from one another can give a conqueror power to dispossess the posterity of the vanquish and turn them out of that inheritance which ought to be the possession of them and their descendants to all generations the conqueror indeed will be apt to think himself master and it be the very condition of the subdue not to be able to dispute their right but if that be all it give no other title than what bare force give to the stronger over the weaker and by this reason he that be strongest will have a right to whatever he please to seize on over those then that join with him in the war and over those of the subdue country that oppose him not and the posterity even of those that do the conqueror even in a just war hath by his conquest no right of dominion they be free from any subjection to him and if their former government be dissolve they be at liberty to begin and erect another to themselves the conqueror it be true usually by the force he have over them compel them with a sword at their breast to stoop to his condition and submit to such a government as he please to afford them but the inquiry be what right he have to do so if it be say they submit by their own consent then this allow their own consent to be necessary to give the conqueror a title to rule over them it remain only to be consider whether promise extort by force without right can be think consent and how far they bind to which i shall say they bind not at all because whatsoever another get from me by force i still retain the right of and he be oblige presently to restore he that force my horse from me ought presently to restore him and i have still a right to retake him by the same reason he that force a promise from me ought presently to restore itie quit me of the obligation of it or i may resume it myselfie choose whether i will perform it for the law of nature lay an obligation on me only by the rule she prescribe can not oblige me by the violation of her rule such be the extort anything from me by force nor do it at all alter the case to say i give my promise no more than it excuse the force and pass the right when i put my hand in my pocket and deliver my purse myself to a thief who demand it with a pistol at my breast from all which it follow that the government of a conqueror impose by force on the subdue against whom he have no right of war or who join not in the war against him where he have right have no obligation upon them but let us suppose that all the men of that community be all members of the same body politic may be take to have join in that unjust war wherein they be subdue and so their live be at the mercy of the conqueror i say this concern not their children who be in their minority for since a father hath not in himself a power over the life or liberty of his child no act of his can possibly forfeit it so that the children whatever may have happen to the father be free men and the absolute power of the conqueror reach no farther than the persons of the men that be subdue by him and die with them and should he govern them as slave subject to his absolute arbitrary power he have no such right of dominion over their children he can have no power over them but by their own consent whatever he may drive them to say or do and he have no lawful authority whilst force and not choice compel them to submission every man be bear with a double right first a right of freedom to his person which no other man have a power over but the free disposal of it lie in himself secondly a right before any other man to inherit with his brethren his father goods by the first of these a man be naturally free from subjection to any government though he be bear in a place under its jurisdiction but if he disclaim the lawful government of the country he be bear in he must also quit the right that belong to him by the laws of it and the possessions there descend to him from his ancestors if it be a government make by their consent by the second the inhabitants of any country who be descend and derive a title to their estates from those who be subdue and have a government force upon them against their free consent retain a right to the possession of their ancestors though they consent not freely to the government whose hard condition be by force impose on the possessors of that country for the first conqueror never have have a title to the land of that country the people who be the descendants of or claim under those who be force to submit to the yoke of a government by constraint have always a right to shake it off and free themselves from the usurpation or tyranny the sword hath bring in upon them till their rulers put them under such a frame of government as they willingly and of choice consent to which they can never be suppose to do till either they be put in a full state of liberty to choose their government and governors or at least till they have such stand laws to which they have by themselves or their representatives give their free consent and also till they be allow their due property which be so to be proprietors of what they have that nobody can take away any part of it without their own consent without which men under any government be not in the state of free men but be direct slave under the force of war and who doubt but the grecian christians descendants of the ancient possessors of that country may justly cast off the turkish yoke they have so long groan under whenever they have a power to do it but grant that the conqueror in a just war have a right to the estates as well as power over the persons of the conquer which it be plain he hath not nothing of absolute power will follow from hence in the continuance of the government because the descendants of these be all free men if he grant them estates and possessions to inhabit his country without which it would be worth nothing whatsoever he grant them they have so far as it be grant property in the nature whereof be that without a man own consent it can not be take from him their persons be free by a native right and their properties be they more or less be their own and at their own dispose and not at his or else it be no property suppose the conqueror give to one man a thousand acres to him and his heirs for ever to another he let a thousand acres for his life under the rent of l or l per annum have not the one of these a right to his thousand acres for ever and the other during his life pay the say rent and hath not the tenant for life a property in all that he get over and above his rent by his labour and industry during the say term suppose it be double the rent can any one say the king or conqueror after his grant may by his power of conqueror take away all or part of the land from the heirs of one or from the other during his life he pay the rent or can he take away from either the goods or money they have get upon the say land at his pleasure if he can then all free and voluntary contract cease and be void in the world there need nothing but power enough to dissolve them at any time and all the grant and promise of men in power be but mockery and collusion for can there be anything more ridiculous than to say i give you and yours this for ever and that in the surest and most solemn way of conveyance can be devise and yet it be to be understand that i have right if i please to take it away from you again tomorrow i will not dispute now whether princes be exempt from the laws of their country but this i be sure they owe subjection to the laws of god and nature nobody no power can exempt them from the obligations of that eternal law those be so great and so strong in the case of promise that omnipotency itself can be tie by them grant promise and oaths be bond that hold the almighty whatever some flatterers say to princes of the world who all together with all their people join to them be in comparison of the great god but as a drop of the bucket or a dust on the balance inconsiderable nothing the short of the case in conquest be this the conqueror if he have a just cause have a despotical right over the persons of all that actually aid and concur in the war against him and a right to make up his damage and cost out of their labour and estates so he injure not the right of any other over the rest of the people if there be any that consent not to the war and over the children of the captives them selves or the possessions of either he have no power and so can have by virtue of conquest no lawful title himself to dominion over them or derive it to his posterity but be an aggressor and put himself in a state of war against them and have no better a right of principality he nor any of his successors than hingar or hubba the danes have here in england or spartacus have be conquer italy which be to have their yoke cast off as soon as god shall give those under their subjection courage and opportunity to do it thus notwithstanding whatever title the kings of assyria have over judah by the sword god assist hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquer empire and the lord be with hezekiah and he prosper wherefore he go forth and he rebel against the king of assyria and serve him not ii kings whence it be plain that shake off a power which force and not right hath set over any one though it hath the name of rebellion yet be no offence before god but that which he allow and countenance though even promise and covenant when obtain by force have intervene for it be very probable to any one that read the story of ahaz and hezekiah attentively that the assyrians subdue ahaz and depose him and make hezekiah king in his father lifetime and that hezekiah by agreement have do him homage and pay him tribute till this time of usurpation as conquest may be call a foreign usurpation so usurpation be a kind of domestic conquest with this differencethat an usurper can never have right on his side it be no usurpation but where one be get into the possession of what another have right to this so far as it be usurpation be a change only of persons but not of the form and rule of the government for if the usurper extend his power beyond what of right belong to the lawful princes or governors of the commonwealth it be tyranny add to usurpation in all lawful governments the designation of the persons who be to bear rule be as natural and necessary a part as the form of the government itself and that which have its establishment originally from the peoplethe anarchy be much alike to have no form of government at all or to agree that it shall be monarchical yet appoint no way to design the person that shall have the power and be the monarchall commonwealths therefore with the form of government establish have rule also of appoint and convey the right to those who be to have any share in the public authority and whoever get into the exercise of any part of the power by other ways than what the laws of the community have prescribe hath no right to be obey though the form of the commonwealth be still preserve since he be not the person the laws have appoint and consequently not the person the people have consent to nor can such an usurper or any derive from him ever have a title till the people be both at liberty to consent and have actually consent to allow and confirm in him the power he hath till then usurp of tyranny as usurpation be the exercise of power which another hath a right to so tyranny be the exercise of power beyond right which nobody can have a right to and this be make use of the power any one have in his hand not for the good of those who be under it but for his own private separate advantage when the governor however entitle make not the law but his will the rule and his command and action be not direct to the preservation of the properties of his people but the satisfaction of his own ambition revenge covetousness or any other irregular passion if one can doubt this to be truth or reason because it come from the obscure hand of a subject i hope the authority of a king will make it pass with him king jam in his speech to the parliament tell them thus i will ever prefer the weal of the public and of the whole commonwealth in make of good laws and constitutions to any particular and private end of mine think ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly felicitya point wherein a lawful king doth directly differ from a tyrant for i do acknowledge that the special and greatest point of difference that be between a rightful king and an usurp tyrant be thisthat whereas the proud and ambitious tyrant doth think his kingdom and people be only ordain for satisfaction of his desire and unreasonable appetites the righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordain for the procure of the wealth and property of his people and again in his speech to the parliament he hath these word the king bind himself by a double oath to the observation of the fundamental laws of his kingdomtacitly as by be a king and so bind to protect as well the people as the laws of his kingdom and expressly by his oath at his coronation so as every just king in a settle kingdom be bind to observe that paction make to his people by his laws in frame his government agreeable thereunto accord to that paction which god make with noah after the deluge hereafter seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease while the earth remaineth and therefore a king govern in a settle kingdom leave to be a king and degenerate into a tyrant as soon as he leave off to rule accord to his laws and a little after therefore all kings that be not tyrants or perjure will be glad to bind themselves within the limit of their laws and they that persuade them the contrary be vipers pests both against them and the commonwealth thus that learn king who well understand the notions of things make the difference betwixt a king and a tyrant to consist only in this that one make the laws the bound of his power and the good of the public the end of his government the other make all give way to his own will and appetite it be a mistake to think this fault be proper only to monarchies other form of government be liable to it as well as that for wherever the power that be put in any hand for the government of the people and the preservation of their properties be apply to other end and make use of to impoverish harass or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular command of those that have it there it presently become tyranny whether those that thus use it be one or many thus we read of the thirty tyrants at athens as well as one at syracuse and the intolerable dominion of the decemviri at rome be nothing better wherever law end tyranny begin if the law be transgress to anothers harm and whosoever in authority exceed the power give him by the law and make use of the force he have under his command to compass that upon the subject which the law allow not cease in that to be a magistrate and act without authority may be oppose as any other man who by force invade the right of another this be acknowledge in subordinate magistrates he that hath authority to seize my person in the street may be oppose as a thief and a robber if he endeavour to break into my house to execute a writ notwithstanding that i know he have such a warrant and such a legal authority as will empower him to arrest me abroad and why this should not hold in the highest as well as in the most inferior magistrate i would gladly be inform be it reasonable that the eldest brother because he have the greatest part of his father estate should thereby have a right to take away any of his younger brothers portion or that a rich man who possess a whole country should from thence have a right to seize when he please the cottage and garden of his poor neighbour the be rightfully possess of great power and riches exceedingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of adam be so far from be an excuse much less a reason for rapine and oppression which the endamaging another without authority be that it be a great aggravation of it for exceed the bound of authority be no more a right in a great than a petty officer no more justifiable in a king than a constable but so much the worse in him as that he have more trust put in him be suppose from the advantage of education and counsellors to have better knowledge and less reason to do it have already a greater share than the rest of his brethren may the command then of a prince be oppose may he be resist as often as any one shall find himself aggrieve and but imagine he have not right do him this will unhinge and overturn all polities and instead of government and order leave nothing but anarchy and confusion to this i answer that force be to be oppose to nothing but to unjust and unlawful force whoever make any opposition in any other case draw on himself a just condemnation both from god and man and so no such danger or confusion will follow as be often suggest for first as in some countries the person of the prince by the law be sacred and so whatever he command or do his person be still free from all question or violence not liable to force or any judicial censure or condemnation but yet opposition may be make to the illegal act of any inferior officer or other commission by him unless he will by actually put himself into a state of war with his people dissolve the government and leave them to that defence which belong to every one in the state of nature for of such things who can tell what the end will be and a neighbour kingdom have show the world an odd example in all other case the sacredness of the person exempt him from all inconveniencies whereby he be secure whilst the government stand from all violence and harm whatsoever than which there can not be a wiser constitution for the harm he can do in his own person not be likely to happen often nor to extend itself far nor be able by his single strength to subvert the laws nor oppress the body of the people should any prince have so much weakness and illnature as to be will to do it the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs that may happen sometimes when a heady prince come to the throne be well recompense by the peace of the public and security of the government in the person of the chief magistrate thus set out of the reach of danger it be safer for the body that some few private men should be sometimes in danger to suffer than that the head of the republic should be easily and upon slight occasion expose secondly but this privilege belong only to the kings person hinder not but they may be question oppose and resist who use unjust force though they pretend a commission from him which the law authorise not as be plain in the case of him that have the kings writ to arrest a man which be a full commission from the king and yet he that have it can not break open a man house to do it nor execute this command of the king upon certain days nor in certain place though this commission have no such exception in it but they be the limitations of the law which if any one transgress the kings commission excuse him not for the kings authority be give him only by the law he can not empower any one to act against the law or justify him by his commission in so do the commission or command of any magistrate where he have no authority be as void and insignificant as that of any private man the difference between the one and the other be that the magistrate have some authority so far and to such end and the private man have none at all for it be not the commission but the authority that give the right of act and against the laws there can be no authority but notwithstanding such resistance the kings person and authority be still both secure and so no danger to governor or government thirdly suppose a government wherein the person of the chief magistrate be not thus sacred yet this doctrine of the lawfulness of resist all unlawful exercise of his power will not upon every slight occasion endanger him or embroil the government for where the injure party may be relieve and his damage repair by appeal to the law there can be no pretence for force which be only to be use where a man be intercept from appeal to the law for nothing be to be account hostile force but where it leave not the remedy of such an appeal and it be such force alone that put him that use it into a state of war and make it lawful to resist him a man with a sword in his hand demand my purse on the highway when perhaps i have not d in my pocket this man i may lawfully kill to another i deliver to hold only whilst i alight which he refuse to restore me when i be get up again but draw his sword to defend the possession of it by force i endeavour to retake it the mischief this man do me be a hundred or possibly a thousand time more than the other perhaps intend me whom i kill before he really do me any and yet i might lawfully kill the one and can not so much as hurt the other lawfully the reason whereof be plain because the one use force which threaten my life i could not have time to appeal to the law to secure it and when it be go it be too late to appeal the law could not restore life to my dead carcass the loss be irreparable which to prevent the law of nature give me a right to destroy him who have put himself into a state of war with me and threaten my destruction but in the other case my life not be in danger i might have the benefit of appeal to the law and have reparation for my that way fourthly but if the unlawful act do by the magistrate be maintain by the power he have get and the remedy which be due by law be by the same power obstruct yet the right of resist even in such manifest act of tyranny will not suddenly or on slight occasion disturb the government for if it reach no farther than some private mens case though they have a right to defend themselves and to recover by force what by unlawful force be take from them yet the right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest wherein they be sure to perish it be as impossible for one or a few oppress men to disturb the government where the body of the people do not think themselves concern in it as for a rave madman or heady malcontent to overturn a wellsettled state the people be as little apt to follow the one as the other but if either these illegal act have extend to the majority of the people or if the mischief and oppression have light only on some few but in such case as the precedent and consequences seem to threaten all and they be persuade in their consciences that their laws and with them their estates liberties and live be in danger and perhaps their religion too how they will be hinder from resist illegal force use against them i can not tell this be an inconvenience i confess that attend all governments whatsoever when the governors have bring it to this pass to be generally suspect of their people the most dangerous state they can possibly put themselves in wherein they be the less to be pity because it be so easy to be avoid it be as impossible for a governor if he really mean the good of his people and the preser vation of them and their laws together not to make them see and feel it as it be for the father of a family not to let his children see he love and take care of them but if all the world shall observe pretences of one kind and action of another arts use to elude the law and the trust of prerogative which be an arbitrary power in some things leave in the princes hand to do good not harm to the people employ contrary to the end for which it be give if the people shall find the minister and subordinate magistrates choose suitable to such end and favour or lay by proportionably as they promote or oppose them if they see several experiment make of arbitrary power and that religion underhand favour though publicly proclaim against which be readiest to introduce it and the operators in it support as much as may be and when that can not be do yet approve still and like the better and a long train of act show the counsel all tend that way how can a man any more hinder himself from be persuade in his own mind which way things be go or from cast about how to save himself than he could from believe the captain of a ship he be in be carry him and the rest of the company to algiers when he find him always steer that course though cross wind leak in his ship and want of men and provision do often force him to turn his course another way for some time which he steadily return to again as soon as the wind weather and other circumstances would let him of the dissolution of government he that will with any clearness speak of the dissolution of government ought in the first place to distinguish between the dissolution of the society and the dissolution of the government that which make the community and bring men out of the loose state of nature into one politic society be the agreement which every one have with the rest to incorporate and act as one body and so be one distinct commonwealth the usual and almost only way whereby this union be dissolve be the inroad of foreign force make a conquest upon them for in that case not be able to maintain and support themselves as one entire and independent body the union belong to that body which consist therein must necessarily cease and so every one return to the state he be in before with a liberty to shift for himself and provide for his own safety as he think fit in some other society whenever the society be dissolve it be certain the government of that society can not remain thus conquerors swords often cut up governments by the root and mangle societies to piece separate the subdue or scatter multitude from the protection of and dependence on that society which ought to have preserve them from violence the world be too well instruct in and too forward to allow of this way of dissolve of governments to need any more to be say of it and there want not much argument to prove that where the society be dissolve the government can not remain that be as impossible as for the frame of a house to subsist when the materials of it be scatter and displace by a whirlwind or jumble into a confuse heap by an earthquake besides this overturn from without governments be dissolve from within first when the legislative be alter civil society be a state of peace amongst those who be of it from whom the state of war be exclude by the umpirage which they have provide in their legislative for the end all differences that may arise amongst any of them it be in their legislative that the members of a commonwealth be unite and combine together into one coherent live body this be the soul that give form life and unity to the commonwealth from hence the several members have their mutual influence sympathy and connection and therefore when the legislative be break or dissolve dissolution and death follow for the essence and union of the society consist in have one will the legislative when once establish by the majority have the declare and as it be keep of that will the constitution of the legislative be the first and fundamental act of society whereby provision be make for the continuation of their union under the direction of persons and bond of laws make by persons authorise thereunto by the consent and appointment of the people without which no one man or number of men amongst them can have authority of make laws that shall be bind to the rest when any one or more shall take upon them to make laws whom the people have not appoint so to do they make laws without authority which the people be not therefore bind to obey by which mean they come again to be out of subjection and may constitute to themselves a new legislative as they think best be in full liberty to resist the force of those who without authority would impose anything upon them every one be at the disposure of his own will when those who have by the delegation of the society the declare of the public will be exclude from it and others usurp the place who have no such authority or delegation this be usually bring about by such in the commonwealth who misuse the power they have it be hard to consider it aright and know at whose door to lay it without know the form of government in which it happen let us suppose then the legislative place in the concurrence of three distinct persons first a single hereditary person have the constant supreme executive power and with it the power of convoke and dissolve the other two within certain periods of time secondly an assembly of hereditary nobility thirdly an assembly of representatives choose pro tempore by the people such a form of government suppose it be evident first that when such a single person or prince set up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws which be the will of the society declare by the legislative then the legislative be change for that be in effect the legislative whose rule and laws be put in execution and require to be obey when other laws be set up and other rule pretend and enforce than what the legislative constitute by the society have enact it be plain that the legislative be change whoever introduce new laws not be thereunto authorise by the fundamental appointment of the society or subvert the old disown and overturn the power by which they be make and so set up a new legislative secondly when the prince hinder the legislative from assemble in its due time or from act freely pursuant to those end for which it be constitute the legislative be alter for it be not a certain number of menno nor their meet unless they have also freedom of debate and leisure of perfect what be for the good of the society wherein the legislative consist when these be take away or alter so as to deprive the society of the due exercise of their power the legislative be truly alter for it be not name that constitute governments but the use and exercise of those power that be intend to accompany them so that he who take away the freedom or hinder the act of the legislative in its due season in effect take away the legislative and put an end to the government thirdly when by the arbitrary power of the prince the electors or ways of election be alter without the consent and contrary to the common interest of the people there also the legislative be alter for if others than those whom the society hath authorise thereunto do choose or in another way than what the society hath prescribe those choose be not the legislative appoint by the people fourthly the delivery also of the people into the subjection of a foreign power either by the prince or by the legislative be certainly a change of the legislative and so a dissolution of the government for the end why people enter into society be to be preserve one entire free independent society to be govern by its own laws this be lose whenever they be give up into the power of another why in such a constitution as this the dissolution of the government in these case be to be impute to the prince be evident because he have the force treasure and offices of the state to employ and often persuade himself or be flatter by others that as supreme magistrate he be incapable of control he alone be in a condition to make great advance towards such change under pretence of lawful authority and have it in his hand to terrify or suppress opposers as factious seditious and enemies to the government whereas no other part of the legislative or people be capable by themselves to attempt any alteration of the legislative without open and visible rebellion apt enough to be take notice of which when it prevail produce effect very little different from foreign conquest besides the prince in such a form of government have the power of dissolve the other part of the legislative and thereby render them private persons they can never in opposition to him or without his concurrence alter the legislative by a law his consent be necessary to give any of their decree that sanction but yet so far as the other part of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the government and do either promote or not what lie in them hinder such design they be guilty and partake in this which be certainly the greatest crime men can be guilty of one towards another there be one way more whereby such a government may be dissolve and that be when he who have the supreme executive power neglect and abandon that charge so that the laws already make can no longer be put in execution this be demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy and so effectively to dissolve the government for laws not be make for themselves but to be by their execution the bond of the society to keep every part of the body politic in its due place and function when that totally cease the government visibly cease and the people become a confuse multitude without order or connection where there be no longer the administration of justice for the secure of mens right nor any remain power within the community to direct the force or provide for the necessities of the public there certainly be no govern ment leave where the laws can not be execute it be all one as if there be no laws and a government without laws be i suppose a mystery in politics inconceivable to human capacity and inconsistent with human society in these and the like case when the government be dissolve the people be at liberty to provide for themselves by erect a new legislative differ from the other by the change of persons or form or both as they shall find it most for their safety and good for the society can never by the fault of another lose the native and original right it have to preserve itself which can only be do by a settle legislative and a fair and impartial execution of the laws make by it but the state of mankind be not so miserable that they be not capable of use this remedy till it be too late to look for any to tell people they may provide for themselves by erect a new legislative when by oppression artifice or be deliver over to a foreign power their old one be go be only to tell them they may expect relief when it be too late and the evil be past cure this be in effect no more than to bid them first be slave and then to take care of their liberty and when their chain be on tell them they may act like free men this if barely so be rather mockery than relief and men can never be secure from tyranny if there be no mean to escape it till they be perfectly under it and therefore it be that they have not only a right to get out of it but to prevent it there be therefore secondly another way whereby governments be dissolve and that be when the legislative or the prince either of them act contrary to their trust for the legislative act against the trust repose in them when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject and to make themselves or any part of the community master or arbitrary disposers of the live liberties or fortunes of the people the reason why men enter into society be the preservation of their property and the end while they choose and authorise a legislative be that there may be laws make and rule set as guard and fence to the properties of all the society to limit the power and moderate the dominion of every part and member of the society for since it can never be suppose to be the will of the society that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one design to secure by enter into society and for which the people submit themselves to legislators of their own make whenever the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people or to reduce them to sla very under arbitrary power they put themselves into a state of war with the people who be thereupon absolve from any farther obedience and be leave to the common refuge which god hath provide for all men against force and violence whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavour to grasp themselves or put into the hand of any other an absolute power over the live liberties and estates of the people by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people have put into their hand for quite contrary end and it devolve to the people who have a right to resume their original liberty and by the establishment of a new legislative such as they shall think fit provide for their own safety and security which be the end for which they be in society what i have say here concern the legislative in general hold true also concern the supreme executor who have a double trust put in him both to have a part in the legislative and the supreme execution of the law act against both when he go about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society he act also contrary to his trust when he employ the force treasure and offices of the society to corrupt the representatives and gain them to his purpose when he openly preengages the electors and prescribe to their choice such whom he have by solicitation threats promise or otherwise win to his design and employ them to bring in such who have promise beforehand what to vote and what to enact thus to regulate candidates and electors and new model the ways of election what be it but to cut up the government by the root and poison the very fountain of public security for the people have reserve to themselves the choice of their representatives as the fence to their properties could do it for no other end but that they might always be freely choose and so choose freely act and advise as the necessity of the commonwealth and the public good should upon examination and mature debate be judge to require this those who give their vote before they hear the debate and have weigh the reason on all side be not capable of do to prepare such an assembly as this and endeavour to set up the declare abettors of his own will for the true representatives of the people and the lawmakers of the society be certainly as great a breach of trust and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government as be possible to be meet with to which if one shall add reward and punishments visibly employ to the same end and all the arts of pervert law make use of to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country it will be past doubt what be do what power they ought to have in the society who thus employ it contrary to the trust that along with it in its first institution be easy to determine and one can not but see that he who have once attempt any such thing as this can not any longer be trust to this perhaps it will be say that the people be ignorant and always discontent to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people be to expose it to certain ruin and no government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up a new legislative whenever they take offence at the old one to this i answer quite the contrary people be not so easily get out of their old form as some be apt to suggest they be hardly to be prevail with to amend the acknowledge fault in the frame they have be accustom to and if there be any original defect or adventitious ones introduce by time or corruption it be not an easy thing to get them change even when all the world see there be an opportunity for it this slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitutions have in the many revolutions that have be see in this kingdom in this and former age still keep us to or after some interval of fruitless attempt still bring us back again to our old legislative of king lord and commons and whatever provocations have make the crown be take from some of our princes head they never carry the people so far as to place it in another line but it will be say this hypothesis lay a ferment for frequent rebellion to which i answer first no more than any other hypothesis for when the people be make miserable and find themselves expose to the ill usage of arbitrary power cry up their governors as much as you will for sons of jupiter let them be sacred and divine descend or authorise from heaven give them out for whom or what you please the same will happen the people generally ill treat and contrary to right will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sit heavy upon them they will wish and seek for the opportunity which in the change weakness and accidents of human affairs seldom delay long to offer itself he must have live but a little while in the world who have not see examples of this in his time and he must have read very little who can not produce examples of it in all sort of governments in the world secondly i answer such revolutions happen not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs great mistake in the rule part many wrong and inconvenient laws and all the slip of human frailty will be bear by the people without mutiny or murmur but if a long train of abuse prevarications and artifices all tend the same way make the design visible to the people and they can not but feel what they lie under and see whither they be go it be not to be wonder that they should then rouse themselves and endeavour to put the rule into such hand which may secure to them the end for which government be at first erect and without which ancient name and specious form be so far from be better that they be much worse than the state of nature or pure anarchy the inconveniencies be all as great and as near but the remedy farther off and more difficult thirdly i answer that this power in the people of provide for their safety anew by a new legislative when their legislators have act contrary to their trust by invade their property be the best fence against rebellion and the probable mean to hinder it for rebellion be an opposition not to persons but authority which be found only in the constitutions and laws of the government those whoever they be who by force break through and by force justify their violation of them be truly and properly rebel for when men by enter into society and civil government have exclude force and introduce laws for the preservation of property peace and unity amongst themselves those who set up force again in opposition to the laws do rebellarethat be bring back again the state of war and be properly rebel which they who be in power by the pretence they have to authority the temptation of force they have in their hand and the flattery of those about them be likeliest to do the proper way to prevent the evil be to show them the danger and injustice of it who be under the greatest temptation to run into it in both the forementioned case when either the legislative be change or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they be constitute those who be guilty be guilty of rebellion for if any one by force take away the establish legislative of any society and the laws by them make pursuant to their trust he thereby take away the umpirage which every one have consent to for a peaceable decision of all their controversies and a bar to the state of war amongst them they who remove or change the legislative take away this decisive power which nobody can have but by the appointment and consent of the people and so destroy the authority which the people do and nobody else can set up and introduce a power which the people hath not authorise actually introduce a state of war which be that of force without authority and thus by remove the legislative establish by the society in whose decisions the people acquiesce and unite as to that of their own will they untie the knot and expose the people anew to the state of war and if those who by force take away the legislative be rebel the legislators themselves as have be show can be no less esteem so when they who be set up for the protection and preservation of the people their liberties and properties shall by force invade and endeavour to take them away and so they put themselves into a state of war with those who make them the protectors and guardians of their peace be properly and with the greatest aggravation rebellantes rebel but if they who say it lay a foundation for rebellion mean that it may occasion civil war or intestine broil to tell the people they be absolve from obedience when illegal attempt be make upon their liberties or properties and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who be their magistrates when they invade their properties contrary to the trust put in them and that therefore this doctrine be not to be allow be so destructive to the peace of the world they may as well say upon the same grind that honest men may not oppose robbers or pirate because this may occasion disorder or bloodshed if any mischief come in such case it be not to be charge upon him who defend his own right but on him that invade his neighbour if the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he have for peace sake to him who will lay violent hand upon it i desire it may be consider what kind of a peace there will be in the world which consist only in violence and rapine and which be to be maintain only for the benefit of robbers and oppressors who would not think it an admirable peace betwixt the mighty and the mean when the lamb without resistance yield his throat to be tear by the imperious wolf polyphemuss den give us a perfect pattern of such a peace such a government wherein ulysses and his companion have nothing to do but quietly to suffer themselves to be devour and no doubt ulysses who be a prudent man preach up passive obedience and exhort them to a quiet submission by represent to them of what concernment peace be to mankind and by show what inconveniencies might happen if they should offer to resist polyphemus who have now the power over them the end of government be the good of mankind and which be best for mankind that the people should be always expose to the bind less will of tyranny or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be oppose when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power and employ it for the destruction and not the preservation of the properties of their people nor let any one say that mischief can arise from hence as often as it shall please a busy head or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the government it be true such men may stir whenever they please but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition for till the mischief be grow general and the ill design of the rulers become visible or their attempt sensible to the greater part the people who be more dispose to suffer than right themselves by resistance be not apt to stir the examples of particular injustice or oppression of here and there an unfortunate man move them not but if they universally have a persuasion ground upon manifest evidence that design be carry on against their liberties and the general course and tendency of things can not but give them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their governors who be to be blame for it who can help it if they who might avoid it bring themselves into this suspicion be the people to be blame if they have the sense of rational creatures and can think of things no otherwise than as they find and feel them and be it not rather their fault who put things in such a posture that they would not have them think as they be i grant that the pride ambition and turbulency of private men have sometimes cause great disorder in commonwealths and factions have be fatal to state and kingdoms but whether the mischief hath oftener begin in the people wantonness and a desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers or in the rulers insolence and endeavour to get and exercise an arbitrary power over their people whether oppression or disobedience give the first rise to the disorder i leave it to impartial history to determine this i be sure whoever either ruler or subject by force go about to invade the right of either prince or people and lay the foundation for overturn the constitution and frame of any just government he be guilty of the greatest crime i think a man be capable of be to answer for all those mischiefs of blood rapine and desolation which the break to piece of governments bring on a country and he who do it be justly to be esteem the common enemy and pest of mankind and be to be treat accordingly that subject or foreigners attempt by force on the properties of any people may be resist with force be agree on all hand but that magistrates do the same thing may be resist hath of late be deny as if those who have the greatest privilege and advantage by the law have thereby a power to break those laws by which alone they be set in a better place than their brethren whereas their offence be thereby the greater both as be ungrateful for the greater share they have by the law and break also that trust which be put into their hand by their brethren whosoever use force without rightas every one do in society who do it without lawputs himself into a state of war with those against whom he so use it and in that state all former tie be cancel all other right cease and every one have a right to defend himself and to resist the aggressor this be so evident that barclay himselfthat great assertor of the power and sacredness of kingsis force to confess that it be lawful for the people in some case to resist their king and that too in a chapter wherein he pretend to show that the divine law shut up the people from all manner of rebellion whereby it be evident even by his own doctrine that since they may in some case resist all resist of princes be not rebellion his word be these quod siquis dicat

cruelty and rage of tyrannymust they see their cities pillage and lay in ash their wive and children expose to the tyrants lust and fury and themselves and families reduce by their king to ruin and all the miseries of want and oppression and yet sit still must men alone be debar the common privilege of oppose force with force which nature allow so freely to all other creatures for their preservation from injury i answer selfdefence be a part of the law of nature nor can it be deny the community even against the king himself but to revenge themselves upon him must by no mean be allow them it be not agreeable to that law wherefore if the king shall show an hatred not only to some particular persons but set himself against the body of the commonwealth whereof he be the head and shall with intolerable illusage cruelly tyrannise over the whole or a considerable part of the people in this case the people have a right to resist and defend themselves from injury but it must be with this caution that they only defend themselves but do not attack their prince they may repair the damage receive but must not for any provocation exceed the bound of due reverence and respect they may repulse the present attempt but must not revenge past violences for it be natural for us to defend life and limb but that an inferior should punish a superior be against nature the mischief which be design them the people may prevent before it be do but when it be do they must not revenge it on the king though author of the villany this therefore be the privilege of the people in general above what any private person hath that particular men be allow by our adversaries themselves buchanan only except to have no other remedy but patience but the body of the people may with respect resist intolerable tyranny for when it be but moderate they ought to endure it thus far that great advocate of monarchical power allow of resistance it be true he have annex two limitations to it to no purpose first he say it must be with reverence secondly it must be without retribution or punishment and the reason he give be because an inferior can not punish a superior first how to resist force without strike again or how to strike with reverence will need some skill to make intelligible he that shall oppose an assault only with a shield to receive the blow or in any more respectful posture without a sword in his hand to abate the confidence and force of the assailant will quickly be at an end of his resistance and will find such a defence serve only to draw on himself the worse usage this be as ridiculous a way of resist as juvenal think it of fight ubi tu pulsas ego vapulo tantum and the success of the combat will be unavoidably the same he there describe it libertas pauperis haec est pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti this will always be the event of such an imaginary resistance where men may not strike again he therefore who may resist must be allow to strike and then let our author or anybody else join a knock on the head or a cut on the face with as much reverence and respect as he think fit he that can reconcile blow and reverence may for aught i know deserve for his pain a civil respectful cudgel wherever he can meet with it secondly as to his secondan inferior can not punish a superiorthat be true generally speak whilst he be his superior but to resist force with force be the state of war that level the party cancel all former relation of reverence respect and superiority and then the odds that remain isthat he who oppose the unjust aggressor have this superiority over him that he have a right when he prevail to punish the offender both for the breach of the peace and all the evils that follow upon it barclay therefore in another place more coherently to himself deny it to be lawful to resist a king in any case but he there assign two case whereby a king may unking himself his word be quid ergo

interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo quoque alexandriam commigrare ac ut populum uno ictu interimeret unam ei cervicem optavit talia cum rex aliquis meditatur et molitur serio omnem regnandi curam et animum ilico abjicit ac proinde imperium in subditos amittit ut dominus servi pro derelicto habiti dominium arlter casus est si rex in alicujus clientelam se contulit ac regnum quod liberum a majoribus et populo traditum accepit alienae ditioni mancipavit nam tunc quamvis forte non ea mente id agit populo plane ut incommodet tamen quia quod praecipuum est regiae dignitatis amisit ut summus scilicet in regno secundum deum sit et solo deo inferior atque populum etiam totum ignorantem vel invitum cujus libertatem sartam et tectam conservare debuit in alterius gentis ditionem et potestatem dedidit hac velut quadam rengi abalienatione effecit ut nec quod ipse in regno imperium habuit retineat nec in eum cui collatum voluit juris quicquam transferat atque ita eo facto liberum jam et suae potestatis populum relinquit cujus rei exemplum unum annales scotici suppeditantbarclay contra monarchomachos i iii c which may be thus englished what then can there no case happen wherein the people may of right and by their own authority help themselves take arm and set upon their king imperiously domineer over them none at all whilst he remain a king honour the king and he that resist the power resist the ordinance of god be divine oracles that will never permit it the people therefore can never come by a power over him unless he do something that make him cease to be a king for then he divest himself of his crown and dignity and return to the state of a private man and the people become free and superior the power which they have in the interregnum before they crown him king devolve to them again but there be but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this state after consider it well on all side i can find but two two case there be i say whereby a king ipso facto become no king and lose all power and regal authority over his people which be also take notice of by winzerus the first be if he endeavour to overturn the governmentthat be if he have a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth as it be record of nero that he resolve to cut off the senate and people of rome lay the city waste with fire and sword and then remove to some other place and of caligula that he openly declare that he would be no longer a head to the people or senate and that he have it in his thoughts to cut off the worthiest men of both rank and then retire to alexandria and he wish that the people have but one neck that he might dispatch them all at a blow such design as these when any king harbour in his thoughts and seriously promote he immediately give up all care and think of the commonwealth and consequently forfeit the power of govern his subject as a master do the dominion over his slave whom he hath abandon the other case be when a king make himself the dependent of another and subject his kingdom which his ancestors leave him and the people put free into his hand to the dominion of another for however perhaps it may not be his intention to prejudice the people yet because he have hereby lose the principal part of regal dignityviz to be next and immediately under god supreme in his kingdom and also because he betray or force his people whose liberty he ought to have carefully preserve into the power and dominion of a foreign nation by this as it be alienation of his kingdom he himself lose the power he have in it before without transfer any the least right to those on whom he would have bestow it and so by this act set the people free and leave them at their own disposal one example of this be to be find in the scotch annals in these case barclay the great champion of absolute monarchy be force to allow that a king may be resist and cease to be a king that be in shortnot to multiply casesin whatsoever he have no authority there he be no king and may be resist for wheresoever the authority cease the king cease too and become like other men who have no authority and these two case that he instance differ little from those above mention to be destructive to governments only that he have omit the principle from which his doctrine flow and that be the breach of trust in not preserve the form of government agree on and in not intend the end of government itself which be the public good and preservation of property when a king have dethrone himself and put himself in a state of war with his people what shall hinder them from prosecute him who be no king as they would any other man who have put himself into a state of war with them barclay and those of his opinion would do well to tell us bilson a bishop of our church and a great stickler for the power and prerogative of princes do if i mistake not in his treatise of christian subjection acknowledge that princes may forfeit their power and their title to the obedience of their subject and if there need authority in a case where reason be so plain i could send my reader to bracton fortescue and the author of the mirror and others writers that can not be suspect to be ignorant of our government or enemies to it but i think hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those men who rely on him for their ecclesiastical polity be by a strange fate carry to deny those principles upon which he build it whether they be herein make the tool of cunninger workmen to pull down their own fabric they be best look this i be sure their civil policy be so new so dangerous and so destructive to both rulers and people that as former age never could bear the broach of it so it may be hop those to come redeem from the impositions of these egyptian undertaskmasters will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers who whilst it seem to serve their turn resolve all government into absolute tyranny and would have all men bear to what their mean souls fit themslavery here it be like the common question will be make who shall be judge whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust this perhaps illaffected and factious men may spread amongst the people when the prince only make use of his due prerogative to this i reply the people shall be judge for who shall be judge whether his trustee or deputy act well and accord to the trust repose in him but he who depute him and must by have depute him have still a power to discard him when he fail in his trust if this be reasonable in particular case of private men why should it be otherwise in that of the greatest moment where the welfare of millions be concern and also where the evil if not prevent be greater and the redress very difficult dear and dangerous but farther this question who shall be judge can not mean that there be no judge at all for where there be no judicature on earth to decide controversies amongst men god in heaven be judge he alone it be true be judge of the right but every man be judge for himself as in all other case so in this whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him and whether he should appeal to the supreme judge as jephtha do if a controversy arise betwixt a prince and some of the people in a matter where the law be silent or doubtful and the thing be of great consequence i should think the proper umpire in such a case should be the body of the people for in such case where the prince hath a trust repose in him and be dispense from the common ordinary rule of the law there if any men find themselves aggrieve and think the prince act contrary to or beyond that trust who so proper to judge as the body of the people who at first lodge that trust in him how far they mean it should extend but if the prince or whoever they be in the administration decline that way of determination the appeal then lie nowhere but to heaven force between either persons who have no know superior on earth or which permit no appeal to a judge on earth be properly a state of war wherein the appeal lie only to heaven and in that state the injure party must judge for himself when he will think fit to make use of that appeal and put himself upon it to conclude the power that every individual give the society when he enter into it can never revert to the individuals again as long as the society last but will always remain in the community because without this there can be no communityno commonwealth which be contrary to the original agreement so also when the society hath place the legislative in any assembly of men to continue in them and their successors with direction and authority for provide such successors the legislative can never revert to the people whilst that government last because have provide a legislative with power to continue for ever they have give up their political power to the legislative and can not resume it but if they have set limit to the duration of their legislative and make this supreme power in any person or assembly only temporary or else when by the miscarriages of those in authority it be forfeit upon the forfeiture of their rulers or at the determination of the time set it revert to the society and the people have a right to act as supreme and continue the legislative in themselves or place it in a new form or new hand as they think good the end note it be no improbable opinion therefore which the archphilosopher be of that the chief person in every household be always as it be a king so when number of households join themselves in civil societies together kings be the first kind of governors among them which be also as it seemeth the reason why the name of father continue still in them who of father be make rulers as also the ancient custom of governors to do as melchizedec and be kings to exercise the office of priests which father do at the first grow perhaps by the same occasion howbeit this be not the only kind of regimen that have be receive in the world the inconveniencies of one kind have cause sundry others to be devise so that in a word all public regimen of what kind soever seemeth evidently to have rise from the deliberate advice consultation and composition between men judge it convenient and behoveful there be no impossibility in nature consider by itself but that man might have live without any public regimen hooker eccl pol i the public power of all society be above every soul contain in the same society and the principal use of that power be to give laws unto all that be under it which laws in such case we must obey unless there be reason show which may necessarily enforce that the law of reason or of god doth enjoin the contrary hooker eccl pol i to take away all such mutual grievances injuries and wrong ie such as attend men in the state of nature there be no way but only by grow into composition and agreement amongst themselves by ordain some kind of government public and by yield themselves subject thereunto that unto whom they grant authority to rule and govern by them the peace tranquillity and happy estate of the rest might be procure men always know that where force and injury be offer they might be defenders of themselves they know that however men may seek their own commodity yet if this be do with injury unto others it be not to be suffer but by all men and all good mean to be withstand finally they know that no man might in reason take upon him to determine his own right and accord to his own determination proceed in maintenance thereof in as much as every man be towards himself and them whom he greatly affect partial and therefore that strifes and trouble would be end less except they give their common consent all to be order by some whom they should agree upon without which consent there would be no reason that one man should take upon him to be lord or judge over another hooker ibid at the first when some certain kind of regimen be once appoint it may be that nothing be then further think upon for the manner of govern but all permit unto their wisdom and discretion which be to rule till by experience they find this for all part very inconvenient so as the thing which they have devise for a remedy do indeed but increase the sore which it should have cure they saw that to live by one man will become the cause of all mens misery this constrain them to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalties of transgress them hooker eccl pol i civil law be the act of the whole body politic doth therefore overrule each several part of the same body hooker ibid at the first when some certain kind of regimen be once approve it may be that nothing be then further think upon for the manner of govern but all permit unto

it should have cure they saw that to live by one man will become the cause of all mens misery this constrain them to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand and know the penalties of transgress them hooker eccl pol the lawful power of make laws to command whole politic societies of men belong so properly unto the same entire societies that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of himself and not by express commission immediately and personally receive from god or else by authority derive at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws it be no better than mere tyranny laws they be not therefore which public approbation hath not make so hooker ibid of this point therefore we be to note that such men naturally have no full and perfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men therefore utterly without our consent we could in such sort be at no man commandment live and to be command we do consent when that society whereof we be a part hath at any time before consent without revoke the same after by the like universal agreement laws therefore human of what kind soever be available by consent hooker ibid two foundations there be which bear up public societies the one a natural inclination whereby all men desire sociable life and fellowship the other an order expressly or secretly agree upon touch the manner of their union in live together the latter be that which we call the law of a commonweal the very soul of a politic body the part whereof be by law animate hold together and set on work in such action as the common good requireth laws politic ordain for external order and regimen amongst men be never frame as they should be unless presume the will of man to be inwardly obstinate rebellious and averse from all obedience to the sacred laws of his nature in a word unless presume man to be in regard of his deprave mind little better than a wild beast they do accordingly provide notwithstanding so to frame his outward action that they be no hindrance unto the common good for which societies be institute unless they do this they be not perfect hooker eccl
