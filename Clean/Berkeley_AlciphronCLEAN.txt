alciphron or the minute philosopher defence of the christian religion against the so call free thinkers george berkeley content first dialogue free think and the general good second dialogue the ethics of mandeville third dialogue the ethics of shaftesbury fourth dialogue the truth of theism fifth dialogue the utility of christianity sixth dialogue the truth of christianity seventh dialogue the truth of christianity want to consider the various things that free thinker can be atheist libertine fanatic scorner critic metaphysician fatalist sceptic but you shouldn think that accord to me every individual free thinker be all of these all be say be that each item on that list characterize some freethinkers you may think that no free thinker be an atheist it have often be say that although there be admittedly some atheists who claim to be philosophical theorists no one be really an atheist as matter of philosophical theory know these things be say but be well assure that one of the most note writers against christianity in our time claim to have discover demonstration knock down proof that there be no god if you take the trouble to consult conversation and book to inform yourself about the principles and tenets of our modern free thinkers sure you ll find that every item on my list be true to life be not write only against book don think that the free think author be be misrepresent if every notion of alciphron or lysicles be not find precisely in what the author have write we can expect that man in private conversation will speak more openly than others write to improve on the hint give by author of book and draw conclusions from their principles whatever they may claim believe that all those who write either explicitly or by insinuation against the dignity freedom and immortality of the human soul can on that account be fairly accuse of unsettle the principles of morality and destroy the mean of make men rationally virtuous we can expect from that direction lot that be harmful to the interest of virtue certain admire writer have express the view that the cause of virtue be likely to suffer less from those who mock it than from those who tenderly nurse it because the nurse be apt to bundle it up too warmly and kill it with excess of care and cherish and also make it mercenary thing by talk so much of its reward leave it to you to decide whether this be fair statement of the situation the dialogues be report in long letter write to friend by fictional gentleman name dion all the name be greek his open word echo berkeley situation when compose this work he be in rhode island face the probable failure of his plan to start college in bermuda the dialogues however be locate in quietly rural part of england first dialogue monday be optimistic enough to believe that by now have be able to send you an agreeable account of the success of the plan that bring me to this remote corner of the country but all could report be the detail of how it go wrong and prefer instead to entertain you with some amuse incidents that have help to soothe me during the inevitable and unforeseeable difficulties that have encounter events be not in our power but we can always make good use even of the worst and have to admit that the way this affair go and the outcome of it give me an opportunity for reflections that help to compensate for my great loss of time and my trouble and expense mind that be free to reflect on its own process if it doesn produce anything useful to the world usually manage to entertain itself for the past several months have enjoy that kind of freedom and leisure in this distant place far from that great whirlpool of business struggle and pleasure that be call the world and my enjoyment of this peaceful place have be greatly increase by the conversation and good qualities of my host euphranor he philosopher and farmer two roles that be not so inconsistent in nature as you might think from the time he leave the university euphranor have live in this small town where he have good house with hundred acres of land adjoin it after the work he have put into improve the land it provide him with comfortable income he have good collection of book mainly old ones leave to him by clergyman uncle who bring him up and the business of his farm doesn hinder him from make good use of it he have read much and think more his health and strength of body help him not to become mentally weary he think he can carry on his study better in the field than in his study and his mind be seldom idle while he prune the tree follow the plough or look after his flock in the house of this honest friend become acquaint with wealthy and distinguish friend of euphranor name crito his anglican parish church be in our town one sunday last summer when he be din at euphranor ask after his guests whom we have see at church with him the previous sunday they be both well say crito but have drop in at the church that one time just to see what sort of congregation our parish could provide they have no further curiosity about the church and so choose to stay at home what say euphranor be they presbyterians no reply crito they be free thinkers euphranor who have never meet any member of that species or sect of men and know little of their write want to know what their principles be what system they accept that be more than can tell you say crito their writers have different opinions some go further and state their position more openly than others but the best way to learn about the current ideas of the sect be to talk with those who declare themselves to be free thinkers your curiosity could now be satisfy if you and dion would spend week at my house with these guests of mine who seem very ready to declare and propagate their opinions alciphron be in his forties and be no stranger to men or to book know him first when we be both train as lawyers in london when he come into rich inheritance he give up his law study and travel through the civilize part of europe after his return he live among the amusements of london but he begin to find them stale and insipid which throw him into sort of irritable laziness my other guest lysicles pronounce lie suh clees be near relative of mine he be quick and clever young gentleman with some general knowledge about bookish matter after he have complete his formal education and see little of the world he become friends with men of pleasure and free thinkers berkeley exact phrase which fear have greatly harm his health and his fortune but what regret most be the corruption of his mind by set of harmful principles that he win ever be cure of they have survive the passions of youth so there no chance of his lose them now these two would be agreeable enough if only they didn fancy themselves free thinkers because of this frankly speak they make it little too obvious that they think themselves wiser than the rest of the world would like it if my guests meet with their match where they least expect it in country farmer euphranor reply not offer to do more than merely inform myself about their principles and opinions so tomorrow ll assign my workers their work for week and accept your invitation if dion be will give my consent meanwhile say crito ll prepare my guests tell them that an honest neighbour would like to talk with them about their free think ll be surprise if they don like the prospect of leave convert behind them even in country village next morning euphranor rise early and spend the morning put his affairs in order after lunch we take our walk to crito which lay through half dozen pleasant field after walk for about an hour we come to crito house which stand in the middle of beautiful little park at the door we meet servant carry small basket of fruit to grove where he say his master be with his two guests we find the three of them sit in the shade and after the usual preliminaries for people meet for the first time euphranor and sit down by them we chat about the beauty of this rural scene the fine season of the year and some improvements new methods of agriculture that have be introduce recently in the adjacent county this give alciphron an open to remark that the most valuable improvements come latest wouldn be much tempt he say to live in place where men don have polish manners or cultivate mind however greatly its land have be improve realise long ago that there be gradual progress in human affairs the first care of mankind be to satisfy the crave of nature next they attend to the conveniences and comfort of life but subdue prejudice and acquire true knowledge that herculean labour come last because it require the most perfect abilities and all other advantage prepare the way for it right say euphranor alciphron have mention our true defect it have always be think that as soon as we have provide subsistence for the body our next concern should be to improve the mind but the desire for wealth step between and occupy men thoughts we re tell that think be what distinguish man from beast to which add that freedom of think make just as much difference between man and man it the noble upholders of this privilege and perfection of human kind the free thinkers mean who have spring up and multiply in recent years to whom we be indebted for all those important discoveries that ocean of light that have break in and pour through in spite of slavery and superstition euphranor who be sincere enemy to both slavery and superstition express his admiration for the good people who have save their country from be ruin by them have spread so much light and knowledge over the land he add that he like the name free thinker and approve of people be free thinkers but in his sense of the term every honest inquirer after truth in any age or country be entitle to it so what about this sect that accord to alciphron have recently spring up what be their tenets euphranor want to know what be their discoveries the ones through which they bring benefit to mankind he would be grateful if alciphron would inform him about all this that will be no trouble reply alciphron because myself be one of them and some of the most considerable free thinkers be close friends of mine and see that euphranor be listen respectfully he go on very fluently the mind of man be like piece of land what uproot plough dig and harrow be to the land be what think reflect and examine be to the human mind there right way to cultivate each land that be allow to stay waste and wild for long time will be choke with brush wood brambles thorns and other plant that be neither useful nor beautiful similarly in neglect uncultivated mind many prejudice and absurd opinions will sprout up owe their origin partly to the soil itself the passions and imperfections of the mind of man and partly to seed that happen to have be scatter there by every wind of doctrine that be raise up by the cunning of politicians the eccentricities of pedants the superstition of fool or the dishonesty of priests what can we expect the human mind to be like today after so many age of be vulnerable to the frauds of dishonest men and the follies of weak ones its prejudice and errors what strong deep root they must have what hard job it will be to tear them out but this difficult glorious work be what the modern free thinkers be undertake alciphron pause and look around his listeners indeed say very praiseworthy undertake people generally think say euphranor that it be praiseworthy to clear and subdue the earth to tame brute animals to provide nourishment for men body and cure their illnesses but what be all this in comparison to the most excellent and useful undertake of free mankind from their errors and improve and adorn their mind these days reply alciphron people be fool enough not to be able to tell their best benefactors from their worst enemies they have blind respect for those who enslave them and regard their deliverers as dangerous men who want to undermine accept principles and opinions it would be pity if such worthy and able men be to meet with any discouragement it seem to me that man who spend his time in such laborious impartial search for truth be better friend to mankind than the greatest statesman or hero the good that they do be confine to small part of the world and short period of time whereas ray of truth can enlighten the whole world and carry on into future age afraid the common herd win soon come to think like you about this but the better sort educate men with good abilities be properly respectful of those who support light and truth no doubt the clergy be always ready to help and applaud your worthy endeavour upon hear this lysicles could hardly stifle his laughter and alciphron with an air of pity tell see that you don know what these men be really like surely you must realise that of all men live the clergy be our greatest enemies they would if they could extinguish the light of nature itself turn the world into dungeon and keep mankind for ever in chain and darkness never imagine anything like this of our protestant clergy particularly the anglican ones whom would have expect go by what have see of them and their write to be lovers of learn and useful knowledge believe me priests of all religions be the same where there be priests there will be priestcraft and where there be priestcraft there will be persecute spirit you can depend on them to exercise their full persecutory power against anyone who have the courage to think for himself and who refuse to be hoodwink and shackle by his reverend leaders those great master of hair split and jargon have fabricate various systems which this be add sarcastically be all equally true and equally important for the world everyone be wed to his own sect and furiously attack all those who disagree with it the next sentence speak of the magistrate term that will occur several more time in these dialogues it be kind of short hand for judge and anyone else who be involve in the enforcement of the law of the land sometimes as on page it seem to cover also law makers the chief vices of priests and churchmen all over the world be cruelty and ambition so they do their best to get the upper hand over the rest of mankind and the magistrate have joint interest with the priest in subdue confuse and scar the people too often lend hand to the church authorities who always think that their authority and possessions aren safe until those whose opinions be different from their own be deprive of their right include the right belong to their social status and even their right as human be picture to yourselves monster or ghost make up of superstition and fanaticism the offspring of statecraft and priestcraft rattle chain in one hand and with the other brandish flame sword over the land and threaten destruction to all who dare to follow the dictate of reason and common sense just think about this and then say if our undertake isn dangerous as well as difficult and yet because of the noble ardour that truth inspire our free thinkers be neither overcome by the difficulty nor daunt by the danger in spite of both we have already make so many convert among people of the better sort that we hope to be able eventually to carry all before us beat down the wall of secular and ecclesiastical tyranny break the fetter and chain of our countrymen and restore the original inherent right liberties and privilege of mankind have say all this in highly emotional way alciphron pause to get his breath back but nobody answer him euphranor be star at him mouth open so alciphron go on turn to euphranor he speak less excitedly the more innocent and honest man be the more vulnerable he be to be take in by the plausible claim of other men you have probably encounter write by our theologians that discuss grace virtue goodness and such matter write that be fit to confuse and deceive simple honest mind but however much they may whitewash their design they be all basically engage in the same selfish project don deny that among the theologians there may be here and there poor half witted man who mean no harm but don hesitate to say that all the men of sense among them be fundamentally drive by ambition avarice and vengefulness while alciphron be speak servant come to tell him and lysicles that some men who be about to set off for london be wait to receive their order so they both get up and go towards the house as soon as they be go euphranor remark to crito that he think the poor gentleman must have be make to suffer greatly because of his free think because he seem to speak with the passion and resentment natural to men who have be treat very badly don believe it answer crito in members of his sect free thinkers have often notice two conversational fault namely high fly rhetoric and tease depend on whether their mood of the moment be tragic or comic sometimes they work themselves into high passions and be then frighten by the ghost they have create when they be have one of those fit every assistant parson of little country church be see as an inquisitor at other time they adopt sly joke manner use hint and allusions say little but insinuate much and over all seem to amuse themselves at the expense of the subject and of their adversaries if you want to know what they really believe you ll have to get them to speak up and not to ramble off the topic they tend to go on about be persecute for free think but they have no good reason for this because everyone be perfectly free to think what he please don know of any persecution in england for opinion intellectual attitude or think but suppose that in every country some care be take to restrain obscene speech and to discourage an outward contempt for what the public hold sacred whatever the person inward thoughts may be whether this care in england have recently become so excessive as to distress the subject of this formerly free and easy government whether the free thinkers can fairly complain of any hardship suffer because of conscience or opinion you ll be better place to judge when you hear their account of the number progress and notions of their sect sure they will tell you all this fully and freely provide nobody present seem shock or offend for in that case they may tone things down out of sheer good manners be never angry with any man for his opinion say euphranor whether he jew turk or idol worshipper he can speak his mind freely to me without fear of offend would even be glad to hear what he have to say provide he say it in an honest open manner whoever dig in the mine of truth be my fellow labourer think but if while be try hard he amuse himself by tease me and fling dust in my eye ll soon be tire of him in the meantime alciphron and lysicles have settle their bite of business return to us lysicles sit down in the same place as before but alciphron stand in front of us with his arm fold and his head lean on his leave shoulder in the posture of man meditate we sit silent so as not to disturb his thoughts and after two or three minutes he say oh truth oh liberty after which he go on muse at this point euphranor venture to interrupt him alciphron he say it isn fair to spend your time in silent soliloquies in this corner of the world we don often get chance to have conversation with learn and well inform men and the opportunity you have put into my hand be too valuable for me not to make the best use of it be you then sincere devotee of truth and can you stand the freedom of fair inquiry that what want more than anything what on every subject on the notions that you first take in with your mother milk and that have ever since be feed to you by other nurse parent pastors tutor religious assemblies book of devotion and other such devices for take hold of men mind love information on all subject that come my way and especially on those that be most important well then if you be in earnest stay fair and stand firm while probe your prejudice and wipe out your principles while pull from your heart your hoary old wive tales he say this in latin quote the poet persius whereupon alciphron frown pause and then launch forth if we take the trouble to dig down to the bottom of things and analyse the basic principles on which opinions rest we ll find that the opinions that be think to be the most important have the flimsiest base be derive either from the casual customs of the country where we live or from indoctrination that we be subject to before we could tell right from wrong true from false alciphron be about the speak of the vulgar and to say what he mean by that word broadly speak its sense at that time be common ordinary run of the mill not very educate not possess of serious intellectual interest something along those line it didn have the sense of rude crude bad mannered or the like in the present work vulgar be sometimes use as term of disdain or condescension to refer to people who wouldn have count as vulgar be the sober strictly literal sense of the word the vulgar mean all the people who don make free use of their reason tend to regard these prejudice as sacred and unquestionable believe them to be imprint on the hearts of men by god himself or convey by revelation from heaven or so intrinsically clear and evident that one can help accept them without any inquiry or examination in this way the shallow vulgar have their head full of fancy principles and doctrines religious moral and political all of which they maintain with level of energy that be proportional to their lack of reason on the other hand those who properly use their faculties in the search for truth be especially careful to weed out of their mind any notions or prejudice that be plant in them before they be old enough to use reason freely and completely our modern free thinkers have actually do this as well as shrewdly dissect the generally accept systems of belief they have trace every establish prejudice to its source the real reason why people believe what they believe and in the course of do this and get comprehensive overview of the various part and age of the world they have be able to observe an amaze variety of customs and rites of religious and civil institutions of ideas and beliefs that be very unlike and even contrary to one another which conclusively show that they can all be true yet each of them be maintain by its supporters with the same air of confidence the same energetic earnestness and when they be examine they all turn out to have the very same foundation namely the strength of prejudice with the help of these observations and discoveries they have break the chain of popular custom and have free themselves from fraud they now generously lend hand to their fellow subject to lead them into the same paths of light and liberty that be quick summary of the view and project of the so call free thinkers if anything that have say or anything ll say later be contrary to your preconceive opinions and therefore shock and disagreeable to you you ll pardon the openness and plainness of philosopher and remember that whenever displease you in that way be do it out of respect for the truth and obedience to your own command well aware that eye long keep in the dark can bear sudden view of noonday light and must be bring to it by degrees for that reason the able free thinkers proceed gradually start with the prejudice to which men be least attach and then move on to undermine the rest by slow and imperceptible degrees till they have demolish the whole fabric of human folly and superstition but don have time here to come at things in that roundabout way ll have to proceed directly and plainly more so perhaps than will be think prudent and well mannered we assure him he be entirely free to speak his mind concern things persons and opinions without hold anything back that be freedom alciphron reply that we freethinkers be as will to give as we be to take it we like to call things by their right name and we can bear have truth suffer because people politely let falsehoods pass without challenge so let us settle this in advance no one will take offence at anything whatsoever that be say on either side we agree to this well then say alciphron let us start our pursuit of the truth by suppose that have be bring up in let say the church of england the anglican church when reach maturity of judgment and think about the particular form of worship and opinions of this church don remember when or how they first take possession of my mind as look back find them to have be in my mind for as far back as my memory of anything stretch then look at the upbringing of children as basis for judgment about how my own upbringing go see them be instruct in religious matter before they can reason about them so that all such instruction be nothing but fill the tender mind of child with prejudice this lead me to reject all those religious ideas regard them as on par with the other follies of my childhood be confirm in this attitude when widen my view and see roman catholics and various sects of protestants which all agree in general profession of belief in christ but differ vastly one from another regard detail of faith and worship then widen my view still further so as to take in jews and moslems see that they agree little with christians in that they all believe in one god but each of these religions have its own special laws and revelations for which it express the same respect as the others have for their laws and revelations look further afield still to examine heathen and idolatrous nations discover an endless variety not only in detail of doctrine and form of worship but even in the very notion of god in which they differ widely from one another and from all the other sects have mention the bottom line be that instead of simple and uniform truth see nothing but discord opposition and wild claim all spring up from the prejudice of upbringing from reflect on and think about these facts thoughtful men have conclude that all religions be false be fables the reason why one man be christian another jew third moslem fourth heathen idolater be that each happen to be bring up in that particular sect so just as each of these contend party condemn the rest so an unprejudiced bystander will condemn and reject them en bloc see that they all originate from the same error rich source and be keep go by the same techniques to meet the same purpose of the priest and the magistrate see note on page so you think that the magistrate go along with the priest in mislead the people do and so must everyone who consider things in true light for you must know that the magistrate main aim be to keep the people under him in awe now the public eye restrain men from open offences against the laws and government but to prevent secret crimes magistrate find it expedient that men should believe that god eye be watch over their private action and design and to intimidate those who might otherwise be draw into crimes by the prospect of pleasure and profit he tell them that whoever escape punishment in this life will be sure to find it in the after life where it will be so heavy and long last that it infinitely outweigh any pleasure or profit that he get from his crimes so it have come about that the beliefs that there be god the soul be immortal and there be future state of reward and punishments have be value as useful engines of government these be rather notional airy doctrines and the rulers need them to impress themselves on people sense and to be retain in their mind and so the rulers of the various civilize nations of the earth have skillfully devise temples sacrifice church rites ceremonies clerical clothe music prayer preach and other such spiritual foolery all of which help the priest to prosper in his career and satisfy the magistrate by frighten and subdue the people that the source of the alliance between church and state religion establish by law and the right immunities and incomes of priests all over the world every government want you to fear god so that you ll honour the king or civil power crito and hear this speech of alciphron with the utmost attention but without look surprise and indeed for us there be nothing new or unexpected in it but euphranor who have never before be present at such conversation couldn help show some astonishment and lysicles who notice it ask him brightly how he like alciphron lecture think it the first you ever hear of that kind he say and you ll have need strong stomach to digest it admit that don have the quickest digestion but it have sometimes gradually be able to assimilate things that at first seem indigestible right now admire alciphron free spirit and eloquence but frankly astonish by his opinions rather than convince of their truth what he say turn to alciphron can you really not believe in the existence of god to be plain with you do not but this be what think would happen flood of light let in on the mind all at once be more likely to dazzle and disorder the mind than to enlighten it if weren short of time would have begin in the regular way first describe the feature of religion that aren essential to it then attack the mysteries of christianity after that proceed to what christianity teach about conduct and finally wipe out the belief in god this last be the first teach of all the religious prejudice and the basis of the rest so that it have take the deepest root in our mind not surprise that you still have this belief this prejudice because have know number of very able men who have trouble free themselves from it not everyone have the same speed and energy of think as you do for one find it hard to keep up with you to help you ll go back little and pick up the thread of my reason first must tell you that have think hard about the idea of truth have find truth to be stable permanent and uniform not various and changeable like modes or fashion or matter of taste in the next place have observe many sects and splinter from sects adopt very different and contrary opinions while all profess christianity reject any doctrine on which they didn all agree and keep only the one that be agree to by all and so become latitudinarian roughly someone who be christian in broad sense with no interest in the detail of doctrine church government form of worship etc that divide branch of christianity from one another after go on to attend to more of the facts saw that christians jews and moslems have their different systems of faith agree only in the belief that there be one god and so become deist roughly someone who reject miracles revelation anything supernatural and have no interest in any organize church or form of worship but believe that natural evidence point to there be god lastly extend my view to all the many nations that inhabit this globe and find that they didn agree with one another or with any of the sects have mention on any point of faith not even on the notion of god so become an atheist because think that man of courage and good sense should follow his argument wherever it lead him and that nothing be more ridiculous than to be free thinker by halve approve of the man who do the job thoroughly not merely lop off the branch but pull up the root from which they grow regard this next bite the grand arcanum be the mythical philosopher stone which be repute to transform lead into gold and or perform other wonder alciphron ironical use of the term may be mean to indicate that atheism transform large part of one beliefsystem in berkeley day call someone genius be stronger than merely call him clever but have less force than genius do in our day so you see that atheism which frighten women and fool be the very peak and perfection of free think it be the grand arcanum to which true genius naturally rise perhaps gradually perhaps as sudden intellectual break through and without it he can never have absolute freedom and peace in his soul to become thoroughly convince about this central point just examine the notion of god with the same freedom that you would examine any other prejudice track it back to its source and you win find that you acquire it through any of your sense though these be in fact the only true mean of discover what be real and substantial in nature you ll find it lie among other old lumber in some obscure corner of your imagination the proper dump grind for visions fancy and prejudice of all kinds and if you be more attach to this bite of lumber than you be to the rest that only because it be the oldest that be all take my word for it and not just mine but that of many of the ablest men of our time whose view about god be the same as mine they really be though some of these people think they should go more gently in declare to the world their opinion on this matter than on most others and have to admit that in england there be still too many people who retain foolish prejudice against the label atheist but that be lessen every day among people of the better sort and when it the prejudice against the word atheist have fade to nothing our free thinkers can then at last be say to have give the death blow to religion because it obvious that so long as people think that god exist religion must survive in some shape or other but once the root have be pluck up all its offspring will wither and decay as matter of course the offspring talk about be all those whimsical notions of conscience duty principle and the like which fill man head with worry awe him with fear and make him more thoroughly slave than be the horse he rid it thousand time better to be hunt by debt collectors or bailiffs with subpoena than to be haunt by these spectres of conscience etc which trouble and embitter all his pleasures create the most real and severe slavery on earth but the free thinker with vigorous flight of think break through those airy trap and assert his basic independence others may talk and write and fight about liberty and outwardly claim to have it but only the free thinker be truly free when alciphron end this speech with an air of triumph euphranor say to him you make clear work it seem that the gentlemen who believe as you do be admirable weeders you have root up world of notions now show me what fine things you have plant in place of them be patient euphranor ll show you first that we leave untouched whatever be sound and good encourage it to grow in the mind of man and secondly ll show you what excellent things we have plant there push on with our close and severe scrutiny we eventually arrive at something solid and real on which all mankind agree namely the appetites passions and sense these be root in nature be real have real object and bring with them real and substantial pleasures food drink sleep and other such animal enjoyments be what all men like and love and if we extend our view to the other kinds of animals we ll find that they all have certain natural appetites and sense which they be constantly engage in gratify and satisfy we be so far from destroy these real natural good things which have nothing notional or fanciful about them that we do our best to cherish and improve them accord to us every wise man regard himself his own bodily existence in this present world as the centre and ultimate end of all his action and concern he regard his appetites as natural guide that will direct him to his proper good and regard his passions and sense as the natural true mean of enjoy this good so he try to keep his appetites alert and his passions and sense strong and lively and work very hard in every possible way to provide the greatest quantity and variety of real object suit to them man who can do this without restraint remorse or fear be as happy as any other animal whatsoever as happy as his nature be capable of be there have give you condense view of the principles discoveries and beliefs of the select spirit here the best mind of this enlighten age after polite little to and fro about the need for open frankness on both side the discussion continue be half ashamed say euphranor to admit that have weakness that lesser mind be prone to no great genius have favourite opinions that you represent as errors and prejudice for instance the immortality of the soul be notion fond of because it support the mind with very please prospect if it be wrong might side with cicero who say that in that case he would be sorry to know the truth and speak of certain philosophers of his time who teach that the human soul be mortal say that he have nothing to thank them for those philosophers seem to have be predecessors of those who be now call free thinkers euphranor go on to remark that free thinker be too general name and that he have no objection to think freely he propose that the sect be give the name that cicero give them with all my heart what name be it why he call them minute philosophers this be minute small not second euphranor point be of course not that these philosophers be small but that they represent valuable things as small or of small importance alciphron will soon suggest different mean for the label right say crito the modern free thinkers be just like the ones that cicero call minute philosophers it an excellent name for them because they diminish all the most valuable things the thoughts view and hop of men they reduce all the knowledge ideas and theories that men have to sense they shrink and downgrade human nature to the narrow low standard of animal life and they assign to us only small pittance of time instead of immortality alciphron very gravely remark that the gentlemen of his sect have not insult man and that if man be little short live negligible animal it wasn their say it that make him so and they be no more to blame for whatever defect they reveal in themselves than good mirror be to blame for make the wrinkle that it show as for your remark that those we now call free thinkers be in ancient time call minute philosophers suggest that this label may have come from their consider things minutely rather than swallow them in great lump as other men usually do anyway we all know that the best eye be necessary to pick out the minutest object so it seem that minute philosophers might have be so call because they be so sharp sight alciphron these minute philosophers that be the right name for them be like pirate who plunder everything that come in their way feel like man who have be leave strip and desolate on bleak beach but who be these profound and learn men that in recent years have demolish the whole fabric that lawgivers philosophers and theologians have be erect for so many age lysicles smile say he believe euphranor be imagine philosophers in square cap and long gown and that in these happy time the reign of pedantry be over our philosophers he say be very different from the awkward students who try to get knowledge by pore over dead languages and ancient author or by shut themselves off from the care of the world to meditate in solitude they be the best breed men of the age men who know the world men of pleasure men of fashion and fine gentlemen have some idea of the people you re talk about but would never have take them for philosophers nor would anyone else until quite recently it seem that for centuries everyone mistakenly think that the way to knowledge be through tedious course of academic education and study but one of the chief discoveries of the present time be that such method slow down and block knowledge rather than promote it crito be of course speak sarcastically he doesn actually side with the minute philosophers he will keep up this tone until page where he will come into the open his open attack on the minute philosophy in the second dialogue be the most rhetorically vivid and passionate things that berkeley ever write there be two strand in academic study read and think what the students mainly read be ancient author in dead languages so that much of their time be spend in learn word which once they ve be laboriously master reward the scholar with old and obsolete ideas that be now quite explode and abandon as for their think what good can possibly come of it if someone doesn have the right materials to think about he can think and meditate for ever without get anywhere those cobwebs that scholars spin out of their own brain be neither useful nor beautiful there only one way to get proper ideas or materials of think and that be by keep good company know several gentlemen who since their appearance in the world the non academic world or perhaps more narrowly the world of high society and fashion have spend as much time rub off the rust and pedantry of college education as they have first spend acquire it ll bet that fourteen year old who be bring up in the modern way will make better show and be more admire in any draw room or assembly of cultivate people than twenty four year old who have set aside long time for study at school and college he ll say better things in better manner and be more like by good judge where do he pick up all this improvement where our solemn ancestors would never have look for it in draw room coffee house tavern gamble den in fashionable place like these it the custom for cultivate persons to speak freely on all subject religious moral or political so that young gentleman who spend much time in them be in position to hear many instructive lecture spice with wit and tease and utter with energy three or four well deliver sentence from man of quality make more of an impression and convey more knowledge than dozen dry academic lecture so there no method no set course of study in those place none but an easy free conversation which take up every topic that anyone offer without any rule or design always think that to get any useful amount of knowledge one need some order in one study that haste and confusion create self satisfy ignorance that our advance can be secure unless they be gradual and that one should start by learn things that might cast light on what be to follow so long as learn could be obtain only by that slow formal course of study few of the better people know much of it but now that learn have grow into pastime our young gentry and nobility unknowingly absorb it during their other pastimes and make considerable progress that presumably why there be so many minute philosophers crito resume his sarcastic pretend admiration for the minute philosophers then it would seem then that method exactness and hard work be positive disadvantage here alciphron turn to lysicles say he could make the point very clear if euphranor have any notion of paint never saw first rate picture in my life but have pretty good collection of print and have see some good draw so you know the difference between the dutch and the italian manner have some idea of it well then compare draw do by the exact and laborious touch of dutch pencil with draw casually dash off in the free manner of great italian master the dutch piece which have take so much trouble and time will indeed be exact but it win have the force spirit or grace that appear in the italian draw and be the effect of an easy free pencil apply this example to our discussion and you ll get my point tell me do those great italian master begin and continue in their art without any choice of method or subject and always draw with the same ease and freedom or do they conform to some method begin with simple and elementary part an eye nose finger which they draw with great effort and care often draw the same thing over and over again so as to get it right and so gradually acquire through patience and hard work through many years the free masterly manner you speak of if the latter be right leave you to apply the example to our discussion so that you will get my point dispute the matter if you like but man of many talents be one thing and pedant be another hard methodical work may do for some kinds of people it take long time to ignite wet straw and when you do you get vile smother flame whereas spirit blaze out at once the minute philosophers have it seem better talents than other men which qualify them for different education tell me euphranor what do one man get to look good in way that others don what cause him to be more polish in how he dress how he speak and how he move nothing but keep good company that be also how men gradually and unconsciously get delicate taste refine judgment certain polish in think and express themselves it not surprise that you folk who live out in the country aren acquaint with the advantage of elegant conversation which constantly keep the mind awake and active make use of its abilities and demand all its strength and spirit on thousand different occasion and on subject that never come in the way of book worm in college any more than ploughman hence the lively faculties quickness of uptake slyness of ridicule and enormous talent of wit and humour that distinguish the gentlemen who believe as you do it should seem then that your sect be make up of what you call fine gentlemen not altogether for we have among us some thoughtful people whose upbringing be coarser but though they can be call fine gentlemen they have make fine contributions to our cause have observe the behaviour of apprentice watermen porter and the gather of rabble in the streets they have arrive at profound knowledge of human nature and make great discoveries about the source spring and motives of moral action the phrase moral action standardly mean action that do or could involve consciously hold reason or purpose these discoveries have demolish the accept systems of morality and do world of good in the city we have men of all sort and professions plod citizens thrive stock broker skillful men of business elegant courtiers gallant men of the army but our chief strength come from those promise young men who have the advantage of modern education these be the grow hop of our sect through their influence we expect the great things we have in view will be actually accomplish would never have think your sect be so considerable many honest folk in england be as much in the dark about these matter as you be it would be wrong to infer what the prevail opinion among people of fashion be from what be say by legislator in parliament judge on the bench or priest in the pulpit they all speak accord to law accord to the reverend prejudice of our forefathers you should go into good company and take note of what able and well breed men say those who be most listen to and most admire in public gather as well as in private conversations only someone who have these opportunities can know our real strength our number and the impression we make on the world by your account there must be many minute philosophers among the men of rank and fortune good many and they contribute greatly to the spread of our notions anyone who know the world have to know that fashion always come from above so the right way to propagate an opinion be to start at the upper end of society also the patronage of men of rank and fortune be an encouragement to our author so you have author among you we do indeed number of them and they be very great men who have favour the world with many useful and profound discoveries he be now lay on really thick his sarcastically intend rhetoric in favour of the minute philosophers he will soon drop it altogether the proper name in this speech refer to real people the device of give one target ancient sound name be common practice in polemical write at that time moschon for instance have prove that man and beast be really of the same nature and that consequently man need only to indulge his sense and appetites to be as happy as brute gorgias have go further demonstrate that man be piece of clock work machine and that think or reason be the same thing as the collision of ball cimon have make distinguish use of these discoveries prove as clearly as any proposition in mathematics that conscience be whim and morality prejudice and that man be no more accountable for his action than clock be for strike what tryphon have write about the usefulness of vice can be refute thrasenor have destroy the foolish prejudice men have against atheism show that republic of atheists might live very happily together demylus have make joke of loyalty and convince the world that there nothing in it we owe to him and to another philosopher of the same type the discovery that public spirit be pointless fanaticism that seize only on weak mind could go on indefinitely recite the discoveries make by writers of this sect but the masterpiece and coup de grace for the old system be learn work by our great diagoras contain demonstration of the nonexistence of god it hasn yet be publish because the public be think to be not yet ripe for it but assure by some judicious friends who have see it that it as clear as daylight and will do world of good by demolish at one blow the whole system of religion these discoveries be publish by our philosophers sometimes in bind book but often merely in pamphlets and loose page make it easier for them to be spread through the kingdom they deserve the credit for the absolute and independent freedom that be grow so fast and frighten the bigots even dull and ignorant people start to open their eye and to be influence by the example and authority of so many able men it should seem by this account or rather by what crito last say that your sect extend their discoveries beyond religion and that the minute philosopher regard loyalty to his king and reverence for the laws as low down things very low down we be too wise to think there be anything sacred about the king or the constitution or indeed about anything else man of sense may seem to show an occasional deference to his king but that as hollow as his deference to god when he kneel at the sacrament so as to qualify himself for an office government job fear god and honour the king be two slavish maxims that have for long time cramp human nature and awe not only weak mind but even men of good understand until their eye be open by our philosophers it easy to see that when the fear of god be quite extinguish the mind must take relax attitude to other duties as soon as those other duties lose their hold on the conscience which always presuppose the existence of god they become mere outward pretences and formalities but still think that englishmen of all school of think however much they may differ on many detail agree in the belief in god and accept at least the proposition of so call natural religion have already tell you my own opinion on those matter and what know to be the opinion of many others think know what have lead you astray euphranor the minute philosophers be sometimes call deists see note on page which have lead you to imagine that they believe in and worship god accord to the light of nature but if you live among them you ll soon be convince of the contrary they have neither time nor place nor form of divine worship they don offer prayers or praise to god in public and in their private live they show disregard or dislike even of the duties of natural religion for example say grace before and after meals this be plain point of natural worship and there be time when everyone do it but in proportion as this sect of minute philosophers prevail it have be lay aside not only by the minute philosophers themselves but also by others who be afraid of be think fool by the minute philosophers be you really say that men who genuinely believe in god decline to perform such an easy and reasonable duty for fear of be sneer at by atheists yes be many people who believe in their hearts the truth of religion be afraid or ashamed to admit it lest they should lose their stand in the eye of those who have the good luck to be regard as great wits and men of genius we must make allowance for crito prejudice euphranor he be worthy gentleman and mean well but doesn it look like prejudice to ascribe the respect that be pay our ingenious free thinkers to good luck rather than to merit sure their merit be very wonderful it would take great man to prove such paradoxes that someone as knowledgeable as minute philosopher should be mere machine or at best no better than brute it be true maxim that man should think with the learn and speak with the vulgar berkeley have already famously say this in his principles of human knowledge regard the vulgar see note on page would be very reluctant to describe gentleman of merit as machine to an audience of prejudice and ignorant men the doctrines of our philosophy have something in common with many other truths in metaphysics geometry astronomy and natural science namely that vulgar ears can bear them all our discoveries and ideas be in themselves true and certain but they be at present know only to the better people and would sound strange and odd among the vulgar it to be hop that this will eventually wear off not surprise that vulgar mind should be startle by the ideas of your philosophy truly very curious sort of philosophy and much to be wonder at the deep thinkers in the minute philosophy camp have go in exactly the opposite way to all the great philosophers of earlier age who try to raise and refine humanity remove it as far as possible from the brute to moderate and subdue men appetites to remind men of the dignity of their nature to awaken and improve their higher faculties and direct them onto the noblest object to fill men mind with high sense of god of the supreme good and of the immortality of the soul but our minute philosophers seem to go the opposite way from all other wise and thoughtful men because they aim to erase from the mind of man the source of all that be great and good to disrupt the order of civil life to undermine the foundations of morality and to bring us down to the maxims and way of think of the most uneducated and barbarous nations and even to pull humanity down to the level of brute beasts and through all this they want to be accept by the world as men of deep knowledge but all this negative knowledge do it come down to anything better than downright savage ignorance that there be no god no spirit no after life no moral duty truly fine system for an honest man to accept or for clever man to be proud of alciphron who hear this discourse with some uneasiness very gravely reply dispute be not to be decide by the weight of authority he say but by the force of reason call our notions brutish and barbarous if you please but it kind of brutishness and barbarism that few people would be capable of if men of the greatest genius hadn clear the log jam because there nothing harder than to overcome one upbringing and conquer old prejudice it take great courage and great strength of faculties to pick out and cast off heap of rubbish that have be gather in the soul from our very infancy so our philosophers thoroughly deserve to be call esprits fort men of strong head free thinkers and so on label that indicate great strength and freedom of mind the heroic labour of these men may be represent for anything can be misrepresent as piratically plunder and strip the mind of its wealth and ornament when really they be only divest it of its prejudice and reduce it to its untainted original state of nature beautiful pure nature you seem to be impress by the beauty of nature please alciphron tell me what the things be that you regard as natural how be we to recognize something as natural for thing to be natural to the mind of man to start with that special case it must appear in the human mind originally from the outset from birth be present universally in the mind of all men and be invariably the same in all nations and age these three originalness universality invariability exclude all the notions that humans have as result of custom and upbringing this also hold for all other species of be cat inclination to pursue mouse be natural because it satisfy the above three criteria but if cat be teach to play trick you win say that the trick be natural for the same reason if peach and apricots be graft onto plum tree nobody will say they be the natural growth of that tree let get back to the human case it seem that the only things you ll count as natural in mankind be ones that show themselves at the time of person first entrance into the world namely the sense and such passions and appetites as reveal themselves as soon as their respective object appear hunger when there be milk fear when there be loud noise and so on that be my opinion note euphranor now ask alciphron seven rhetorical question to the first six of which alciphron give the expect answer include it seem so do and it be true to spare us the tedious questionand answer routine the question will appear here as simple statements with the first six answer omit this condense device will be use on fourteen other occasion each mark by four or more statements by euphranor label with roman numerals and mention of this note the leave blossom and apples of an apple tree be natural to it although it doesn have them from the outset ii the appetite of lust and the faculty of reason be natural to man even though they don shoot forth open and display themselves as leave and blossom do in tree until long after his original infancy iii so it seem that you be be rash when you say that the first criterion for something be natural to the mind be that it should appear in it originally iv also it be natural for an orange tree to produce oranges but if you plant such tree at the north end of great britain you may if you work hard at it get good salad leave but no fruit in the southern part of the island hard careful work may get it to produce mediocre fruit but in portugal or naples it will produce much better fruit with little or no trouble on the part of the farmer vi the plant be the same in all these place but it doesn produce the same fruit sun soil and cultivation make difference vii and since accord to you it the same story for every species can we conclude that some things may be natural to mankind although they be not find in all men and aren invariably the same where they be find hold on euphranor you must explain yourself further shan be rush into concede your point you re right to be wary alciphron don like these ensnare question don want you to go along with me out of politeness just tell me what you think about each particular matter so that we understand one another know what we agree on and proceed together in find out the truth our opinions will stand the test we fear no trial proceed as you please see note on page we seem to have find that things may be natural to men without actually be on display in all men or not as completely on display because differences of culture and other advantage affect what come of human nature as much as they do with the nature of plant be use your own comparison ii men at all time and place when they arrive at certain age express their thoughts by speech iii so it seem that language be natural iv yet there be great variety of languages from all this it follow that thing may be natural and yet admit of variety vi it seem to follow that thing may be natural to mankind without have the mark of naturalness that you present without be original universal and invariable vii consequently religious worship and civil government may be natural to man despite the fact that they occur in variety of form and in different degrees of perfection viii you have grant already that reason be natural to mankind ix so whatever be agreeable to reason be agreeable to the nature of man doesn it follow from this that truth and virtue be natural to man whatever be reasonable admit to be natural the fruit that we value most be the ones that come from the most strongly grow and mature stock in the choicest soil similarly then oughtn we to value most the sublime truths that be the fruit of mature think and have be rationally deduce by men with the best and most develop mind and if this be right and these things be in fact reasonable natural and true they oughtn to be write off as unnatural whims errors of upbringing and groundless prejudice just because they be raise and develop by manure and cultivate young human mind because they take root early and bring forth early fruit through the care and diligence of our instructors agree provide that they can still be rationally deduce but to take for grant that what men vulgarly call the truths of morality and religion have rational basis would be beg the question he mean that it would be in effect include the conclusion of one argument amongst its premise that be the only mean of beg the question until late in the th century when the vulgar specifically the ones work as journalists learn the phrase and assume that it mean raise the question you re right about that so don take for grant that the truths of morality and religion be rationally deduce only suppose that if they be then they must be regard as natural to man that they fit with and grow from the most excellent part of human nature the part that other natural species don have have no objection to bring against this then what be we to think of your former assertions mean your claim that anything that be natural to man can be find in all men in all nations and age of the world and that to obtain genuine view of human nature we must set aside all the effect of upbringing and instruction and look only at the sense appetites and passions that be to be find originally in all mankind and that therefore the notion of god can be base in nature because it isn originally in the mind and isn the same in all men how do you reconcile these open statements of yours with your recent concessions ones that the force of truth seem to have extort from you tell me euphranor isn truth single uniform invariable thing and if it be isn the existence of the many different and mutually inconsistent notions that men have of god and duty plain proof there be no truth in them freely grant that truth be constant and uniform so that two opinions that contradict one another can both be true but it doesn follow that they be both false when there be conflict opinions about the same thing the one if there be one that be ground on clear and evident reason should be regard as true and others accept only to the extent that they be consistent with that privilege one reason be the same at all time and place and when it be use properly it will lead to the same conclusions two thousand years ago socrates seem to have reason himself into the same notion of god that be entertain by the philosophers of our days if you ll allow someone who isn free thinker to be call philosopher and consider confucius remark that man should be on guard in his youth against lust in manhood against quarrelsomeness and in old age against greed this morality be as current in europe as in china but when opinions differ that show that there be uncertainty so it would be good if all men think the same way what do you think to be the cause of lunar eclipse the earth come between the sun and moon make shadow on the moon be you sure of this certainly be all mankind agree in this truth by no mean ignorant and barbarous people give different ridiculous explanations for this phenomenon so it seem that there be different opinions about the nature of an eclipse there be yet one of these opinions be true it be thus when there be conflict opinions about something it may still be the case that the thing exist and one of the opinions about it be true accept that well you argue from the variety of opinions about god nature to the falsity of the opinion that he exist and now it seem that this argument be not conclusive and don see either how you can infer the falsity of any moral or religious tenet from men conflict opinions on the same subject isn argue like that on par with argue that no historical account of matter of fact can be true if report of it conflict with one another or argue that because the various school of philosophy maintain different opinions none of them can be in the right not even the minute philosophers during this conversation lysicles seem uneasy like someone who profoundly want there to be no god alciphron he say think you be sit tamely on the side line while euphranor undermine the foundation of our tenets don be afraid reply skillful player of game sometimes ruin his adversary by give him some advantage at first be glad he say turn to euphranor that you re will to argue and make your appeal to reason for my part shan be afraid to follow wherever reason lead so let me say this openly freely concede the point you have be contend for don value the success of few crude notions throw out in casual conversation any more than the turks care about the loss of the rubbish infantry that they position at the front of their armies so as to waste the gunpowder and blunt the swords of their enemies have keep good half of my arguments in reserve and be ready to bring them forward will undertake to prove don doubt your ability to prove alciphron but before put you to the trouble of any more proof like to know whether the notions of your minute philosophy be worth prove mean whether they be useful and helpful to mankind as to that let me tell you thing can be useful to one man view and not to another but truth be truth whether or not it useful and it mustn be evaluate by whether it be convenient for this or that man or sect but isn the general good of mankind to be regard as rule or guide to evaluation of moral truths indeed of all truths that direct or influence the moral action see note on page of men it not clear to me that that be right know of course that legislators theologians and politicians have always maintain that it be necessary for the well be of mankind that men should be keep in awe by the slavish notions of religion and morality but even if you be right about what be convenient or helpful how do that prove these moral notions to be true convenience be one thing and truth be another so real philosopher will set aside all advantage and consider only truth itself tell me alciphron be your real philosopher wise man or fool without question he the wisest of men as between someone who act with design and someone who act at random which should we regard as the wiser the one who act with design see note on page well then whoever act with design act for some end ii and wise man act for good end iii and he show his wisdom in his choice of mean to the end he aim at iv and so the more excellent the pursue end be and the more appropriate the choose mean to it be the wiser the person should be think to be now rational agent can aim at more excellent end than happiness vi of good things the greater good be most excellent vii the general happiness of mankind be greater good than the private happiness of one man or of some particular class of men viii so the general happiness of mankind be the most excellent end ix so those who pursue this end by the most appropriate methods should be regard as the wisest men wise man be govern by wise notions rather than foolish ones xi it seem to follow that someone who promote the general well be of mankind by the proper necessary mean be truly wise and act on wise ground xii furthermore folly be the opposite of wisdom xii so mightn we infer that men who try to dislodge principles that have necessary connection with the general good of mankind be foolish perhaps this might be grant but at the same time have to say that it be in my power to deny it what you admit the premise so surely you win deny the conclusion want to know what the rule be for our debate in this process of question and answer if man make slip be he allow to recover for if you be on the lookout for every advantage that you can snatch without allow for surprise or inattention on my part have to tell you that this be not the way to convince me of your view not aim at triumph alciphron all want be truth so it completely open to you to unravel all that have be say and to correct any slip you have make but then you must point it out clearly otherwise we can ever arrive at any conclusion be also sincerely devote to truth and agree with you on these term to proceed together in search of it in the course of our present inquiry think slip when acknowledge that the general happiness of mankind be greater good than the particular happiness of one man in fact the individual happiness of each man alone constitute his own entire good the happiness of other men be not part of my happiness so from my standpoint it isn good mean true natural good so it can be reasonable end for me to aim at because no wise man will pursue an end that doesn concern him be talk about true natural end not the end one might announce as political pretences this be the voice of nature the fountain source and pattern of all that be good and wise so would you like to follow nature and accept her as guide and as pattern for you to imitate want that more than anything where do you get this respect for nature from from the excellence of its productions for example you say that there be usefulness and excellence in plant because its many part be connect and fit to each other in such way as to protect and nourish the whole plant make the individual grow and propagate the species and also because we get pleasure and benefit from it grapes from vine shade or timber from an oak just so similarly don you infer the excellence of animal body from observe the structure and fitness of their many part which enable the part to work together for the well be of each other as well as of the whole animal don you also notice natural union and co operation between animals of the same species and that even animals of different species have certain qualities and instincts through which they contribute to the exercise nourishment and delight of each other even inanimate inorganic materials seem to have an excellence relative to each other why would water be excellent if it didn cause herbs and vegetables to spring from the earth and put forth flower and fruit and what would become of the beauty of the earth if it weren warm by the sun moisten by water and fan by air note the four elements of ancient greek philosophy throughout the whole system of the visible and natural world don you see mutual connection and correspondence of part and isn that the basis for your idea of the perfection and order and beauty of nature accept all this now didn the stoics who be no more bigots than you be say and didn you say few minutes ago that this pattern of natural order be one that rational agents ought to imitate don deny that this be true so oughtn we infer the same union order and regularity in the moral world that we see in the natural world we ought shouldn it seem to follow from this that reasonable creatures be make for one another and consequently that man who want live accord to nature ought to consider himself not as an independent individual whose happiness be unconnected with the happiness of others but rather as the part of whole for whose common good he ought work together with the other part other men suppose this to be true what then win it follow that wise man should consider and pursue his own private good in the light of and in combination the good of other men you grant this point but later say that that be slip indeed the point doesn need fancy argument by me because it have always be see to be clearly prove by how we feel for one another pain and pleasure and by the mutual affections by which mankind be knit together and because it be the constant doctrine of those who be think the wisest and most thoughtful men among the ancients platonists aristotelians and stoics not to mention christians whom you pronounce to be an unthinking prejudice sort of people shan dispute this point with you well then since we be in agreement up to here shouldn it seem to follow from the premise that if the beliefs in god future state and moral duties be necessarily connect with the well be of mankind then those beliefs be the only wise right and genuine source of human conduct you have be lead to this conclusion by your own concessions and by the analogy of nature by the thesis that human conduct ought to fall into pattern that natural events do fall into have be draw into it step by step through many preliminaries and can now remember them all clearly but would point out that you rely on the thesis that those religious and moral principles be necessarily connect with the well be of mankind and that something that you haven prove and haven grant berkeley text like this version of it leave unclear what direction of necessary connection in question either the beliefs in god etc inevitably contribute to human well be or without them human well be be impossible think it great big fundamental prejudice and if have time could show you that that what it be but it late now shall we put off this subject till tomorrow with that we put an end to our conversation for that even second dialogue tuesday in the original work though not in this version this dialogue be the second to longest of the set it not very interest philosophically and connect fact in it the free think side be uphold only by lysicles with alciphron silent throughout next morning alciphron and lysicles say that the weather be so fine that they would like to spend the day outside have picnic meal under shade in some pleasant part of the countryside so we go to nearby beach and walk on the sand until the sun become too hot to be comfortable we then go in among the tree and sit down and immediately lysicles address himself to now ready to make good on my undertake to show there be nothing in the necessary connection that some men imagine there to be between the principles you be defend and the public good if the question be to be decide by the authority of legislators or philosophers of course it would go against us that because those men generally take it for grant that vice be harmful to the public and that the only way to keep men from vice be through their fear of god and their sense of an after life from which they infer that the belief in such things be necessary to the well be of mankind this false notion have hold sway for centuries and have do an infinite amount of mischief it have be the real cause of religions be establish within state and of the way laws and magistrates have protect and encourage the clergy and their superstitions even some of the wisest ancient philosophers ones who agree with our sect in deny the existence of god and the immortality of the soul be weak enough to accept the common prejudice that vice be hurtful to human societies but england have recently produce great philosophers who have undeceive the world and conclusively show that private vices be public benefit this be the subtitle of mandeville notorious fable of the be lysicles will now devote about page to present arguments take from mandeville it wasn until now that this discovery be make and our sect of free thinkers have the glory of it back to sarcasm it may be that some men with fine intellects do in former age have glimpse of this important truth but probably they live at ignorant time and in bigoted countries that weren ripe for such discovery men of few talents and short sight be able to see no further than one link along chain of consequences be shock at small evils that come with vice but those who can take in more and look along lengthy series of events can see thousands of examples of happiness result from vice and of good grow out of evil shan trouble you with authoritative writers or elaborate arguments let just look at some plain matter of fact take each particular vice and track it through all its effect and consequences and you clearly see the advantage it bring to the public drunkenness for instance be harmful vice accord to your sober moralists but that because they didn take into account the good effect that flow from it lysicles go on to describe some of these for vulgar drunkenness income from tax on malt and employment for many different kinds of workers in the beer industry for drunkenness cause by wine and spirit admittedly that send money into foreign countries but it create employment in the home country vastly increase and proliferate by the need for ship then there be all the trade involve in make things that ship export to pay for the wine and spirit and every trade be support by and support yet further trade so that there no end to the good that come from drunkenness then equally stupidly your half witted folk be give to condemn game here play card for money on the face of it card play seem to be very idle and useless occupation but if you dig down below the face of it you ll see that this idle pastime employ the card maker who provide work for the paper mill which support the poor man who collect discard rag not to mention the workers who be employ in build and equip those mill look still deeper and you ll find that candle to light the game and the hire of sedan chair to take the players to the game employ the industrious and the poor in this way they be help by card sharpers and gentlemen who wouldn give penny in charity you may object that many gentlemen and ladies be ruin by game but if you do you aren take into account that what one man lose another get so that as many be enrich as be ruin money change hand that what the life of business and commerce consist in the circulation of money when money be spend the public doesn care who spend it suppose an upper class fool be cheat by very low breed fellow who have more brain what harm do this do to the public poverty be relieve ingenuity be reward the money stay at home you may object that man make poor by game may resort to some desperate conduct that will be hurtful to the public lysicles go on to speak of the good highwayman can do mainly by spend extravagantly during his short and merry life but also through the reward that may go to poor family that turn him in to the police my topic be game which smoothly lead me to the advantage of highway robbery oh the beautiful and neverenough admire connection of vices it would take too long to show how they all hang together and what an infinite amount of good arise from each of them ll add just few word now on favourite vice then ll leave you to work out the rest of the story for yourself ve show you how consider poor girl who doesn have what you would call an honest half crown week to spend she have the good luck to become someone keep mistress and immediately she employ milliners laundresses dressers fabric sellers and number of other trade all to the benefit of her country we could go on for ever track every particular vice through its consequences and effect show the vast advantage they all bring to the public the true spring that drive the great machine of commerce and make the state flourish have be little understand until now your moralists and theologians have long be corrupt the genuine sense of mankind fill men head with absurd principles so long and so absurd that few men now can look at life with an unprejudiced eye and fewer still have the talents and intelligence to pursue long chain of consequences relations and dependences which be what you must do if you want to form sound and complete notion of the public welfare oh say euphranor who have listen to this speech very attentively you be the very man want lysicles eloquent and able well inform about the principles of your sect and will to impart them to others tell me be it easy to get these principles accept in the world it be easy among very able men and people of fashion though you ll sometimes meet with strong prejudice against them in people of the middle sort an effect of ordinary talents and low breed be surprise if men be not shock at such surprise notions so contrary to all laws education and religion they have be even more shock if it hadn be for the skillful write style of our philosophers know that most men be influence by name rather than by things they have introduce certain clean up way of speak which lessen much of the revulsion and prejudice against vice explain this for me well in our dialect an immoral man be man of pleasure card sharper be one who play the whole game an adulterous lady be say to have an affair an adulterous gentleman be say to be gallant rogue in business be say to be one who know the world by this mean we have no such things as drunkards womanisers whore or rogues in the fashionable world whose inhabitants can enjoy their vices without have nasty label attach to them so it seem that vice be fine thing with an ugly name be assure it be plato be afraid that young people might be corrupt by the myths that represent the gods as vicious accord to you it seem that attitude be an effect of his weakness and ignorance it be take my word for it yet plato have keep good company and live in court and cicero who know the world well have deep respect for him plato and cicero may have look good in ancient athens or rome but if they return to life today they would be regard as underbred pedants at most coffee house in london there be several able men who could convince plato and cicero that they know nothing about morals and politics the very topics that they be value so much for not the most sharp witted of men lysicles hasn pick up the note of sarcastic scorn in what crito have just say know ever so many shrewd men both in royal court circle and in the business part of the city who have five time plato sense and don care in the slightest what notion their sons have of god or virtue can illustrate this doctrine of lysicles by two examples that will make you perceive its force the examples be fictional in the first minute philosopher turn his son into member of that sect which lead to the son murder him and then squander his estate until he go bankrupt in the second minute philosopher convert his wife to his way of think he rightly think this will stop her from give to charity and this lead her to adopt an extravagant way of life include play card for high stake thus use up most of her husband wealth in each case crito recite the mandevillean public benefit of the behaviour in question the murderous son recklessness spread his inherit wealth more widely than his miserly father ever would have do the extravagant wife through her game transfer considerable share of her husband fortune to number of sharp witted men who need it more and circulate it faster than her husband would have do crito maintain straight face while he tell these stories but couldn help smile which lysicles notice superficial mind he say may find something to ridicule in these account but anyone who be really competent in rational think must see that wise commonwealth ought to encourage maxims that bring benefit to everyone and do harm only to particular private persons or families speak for myself say euphranor declare that dazzle and bewilder rather than convince by your reason as you yourself point out it take great deal of think to grasp the connections of many distant point so please put up with my slowness and allow me to take to piece something that be too big to be take in all at once and when can match your speed allow me to follow you step by step as fast as can that be reasonable it not everyone who can all in one swoop take in long chain of argument see note on page your various arguments seem to centre on this vice circulate money and promote industry which cause people to flourish ii and vice produce this effect by cause extravagant consumption which be the most beneficial to the manufacturers give them quick demand and high price iii so you think that drunkard because he drink more than other men bring more benefit to the brewer and the vintner than other men do iv healthy man drink more than sick man sober man be healthier than drunkard so vi sober man in good health may drink more than drunkard when he be sick vii man will consume more meat and drink in long life than in short one viii so sober healthy man may in long life circulate more money by eat and drink than glutton or drunkard circulate in short life what of it well it seem that the sober healthy man may be more beneficial to the public mean beneficial through how he eat and drink than the glutton or the drunkard be you ll never get me to agree that temperance be the way to promote drink but you will agree that sickness lessen drink and that death put an end to it the same argument will hold so far as can see for every vice that harm men health and shorten their live and if that be so the public benefit of vice win be so sure grant some makers or traders might be as well encourage by the sober men as the vicious what about the ones whose livelihood depend entirely on vice and vanity if there be people like that couldn they be employ in some other way without loss to the public tell me lysicles be there anything in the nature of vice in itself that make it public bless or be it only the consumption it cause have already show how it benefit the nation by the consumption of things the nation manufacture and you have agree that long and healthy life consume more than short and sickly one and you win deny that many consume more than one you do the math which be more likely to promote the industry of his countrymen virtuous marry man with healthy children of his own who also feed and clothe the orphan in his neighbourhood or fashionable loose live man about town doesn innocently spend money circulate as well as money spend on vice and if it do so doesn your line of think imply that innocent activities benefit the public as much as vicious ones what have prove prove clearly and nothing more need to be say about it can see that you have prove anything unless you can show that it be impossible to spend fortune innocently have think that the public welfare of nation consist in the number and good condition of its inhabitants have you anything to object to this think not which would contribute more to this end employ men in outdoor manly exercise or employ them in sedentary business within doors the former suppose doesn it seem to follow that build garden and agriculture would employ men more usefully to the public than if tailor barber perfumers distillers and the like be multiply agree but this go against you because what incite men to build and plant be vanity and vanity be vice but if man be to build and plant mean to employ people to build and plant for his convenience or pleasure in proportion to his fortune without foolish ostentation and without exaggerate the value of his house and garden they wouldn be the effect of vice and how do you know that this can happen the economic argument about whether and to what extent private vices be public benefit continue through many not very interest page with lysicles continue to be stubborn and continue not to understand the spirit in which crito extravagantly support the minute philosophers position talk of all the good that have be do by the fire in london and the injustice do to free thinker who in purely principled way murder his father and be hang for it they discuss little the question of whether it be dangerous to publish such view the answer be that it be safe on the anti religious side of the minute philosophy doctrine less so on the pro vice legal and political side lysicles say that he want the whole governmental and legal structure overhaul in the light of the pro vice principles that free thinkers have discover then you be it seem in favour of bring about thorough reformation as for what be commonly call the reformation could never see how the world be the better for it protestantism be much the same as popery except for be more prudish and disagreeable note writer of ours calculate that the benefit of hoop petticoats be nearly equal to the benefit of the reformation but think he be flatter it come back to your question thorough reformation be thorough liberty leave nature absolutely free to work her own way and all will be well that what we aim at our principles win let us settle for less crito be zealous protestant and when he hear lysicles pass jab at the reformation he couldn refrain from join in speak his own mind rather than parody the free thinkers the worst effect of the reformation he say be that it rescue wicked men from darkness that have keep them in awe this have turn out to be hold out light to robbers and murderers and the light bring by the reformation may have do harm in another way too namely by encourage free think it didn have to do that light in itself be good and the light that show man the folly of popish superstition might also show him the truth of protestant religion and the madness of atheism but some people have use the light only to see the evils on one side roman catholicism and to run blindly into the arm of the worse evils of the opposite extreme atheism that be to make the best of things produce evil in the way that you show the worst things produce good namely accidentally or indirectly lysicles be little disconcert by crito emphatic tone but after short pause he reply briskly that not everyone have the talent to think about the public good true say euphranor also think that not everyone can frame notion of the public good much less make good judgments about how to promote it but you lysicles who be master of this subject please tell me doesn the public good of nation imply the particular good of its individuals it do and doesn the good or happiness of man consist in his have both soul and body sound and in good condition enjoy the things that their natures require and free from things that be odious or hurtful to them don deny that all this be true well it seem worthwhile to consider whether the regular decent life of virtuous man mightn be as conducive to this as the mad sallies of intemperance and debauchery ll admit that without the aid of vice nation may merely survive be keep alive but it can possibly flourish to get money and goods into rapid circulation in state there must be extravagant and irregular motion in the appetites and passions the more people nation contain and the happier they be the more that nation can be say to flourish think we be agree on this we be so you concede that riches be not an ultimate end but should be consider only as mean to happiness do it seem that mean can be useful unless we know what the end be and how to apply the mean to it it seem so doesn it follow that in order to make nation flourish it isn enough to make it wealthy without know what the true end and happiness of mankind be and how to apply wealth towards achieve that end to the extent that these point be know and practise think the nation would be likely to flourish but for people who don know or practise them gain riches seem to me on par with let sick man have plenty of food and drink which it will harm him to consume this be just sophistry it be argue without persuade look into how in general people live their live examine the pursuits of men have due respect for the people ways of interact and get on with one another and you ll soon be convince that nation can be make flourish and happy through riches just through riches give them wealth and they will make themselves happy without that political invention that trick of governments and philosophers call virtue in the next few page which be not philosophically very nourish the main topics of discussion be these whether virtue be trick of governments which segment of the population should be listen to with respect lysicles respond to euphranor suggestion of country gentlemen and farmers and the better sort of tradesmen with blunder rudeness if people in general be so open to prejudice mightn there be some prejudice in the minute philosophers position bodily health be real objective state which can be drive up or down by what be do to the body why not an analogous view of spiritual or mental health here be how this last theme develop can we suppose that there be such state as healthy constitution of the soul the state it be in when its notions be right its judgments true its will regular its passions and appetites keep moderate and direct to the right object and the man whose mind be so constitute isn he properly call virtuous and shouldn every good man try to produce this healthy disposition in the mind of his countrymen if these things have any appearance of truth as they seem to me to have it isn so obvious that virtue be mere whim or fashion or trick as you choose to say it be you take me by surprise when you say this must admit give the conversation we have about this yesterday even if you call that back to your mind it might perhaps save both of us some trouble frankly euphranor admit to have forget everything you say about virtue duty and all that the point you make be of an airy notional nature which make them apt to vanish without leave any trace in mind that be accustom to receive impression only from realities at this euphranor look at crito and me and say smile have be get out of line my role be to learn and his to instruct then we have several page about happiness and especially pleasure human pleasures versus animal ones higher pleasures versus lower ones transient pleasures versus more last ones and so on euphranor allude to the sincerity the intensity and the duration of pleasures at one point lysicles rhapsodize about the pleasures of card play people of fashion couldn live without card they provide the most delightful way of pass an even for an assemblage of gentlemen and ladies who otherwise wouldn know what to say or do with themselves and pack of card doesn merely give them something to do when they be together it also draw them together square dance give them pleasure to look forward to during the dull hours of the day they reflect on it with delight and it be something to talk about when it be over so the chief amusement of these people of fashion be an activity that any manual labourer can engage in be as well qualify to get pleasure from card as peer be it look as though life be drag for these people of fashion and that their fortunes aren do them much good can well imagine that when people of certain sort be bring together they would prefer do anything to the boredom of their own conversation but it isn easy to think that there any great pleasure in this play here play card for money be serious amusement that bring relief to man of pleasure after the more lively and affect enjoyments of sense it kill time better than anything and be most admirable antidote to redirect or prevent thoughts that might otherwise prey on the mind can easily see that no man on earth ought to value antidotes for irritable boredom more than man of fashion and pleasure an ancient sage speak of someone of that sort say he be make wretched by disappointments and appetites and if this be true of the greeks who live in the sun and have so much spirit incline to think it even truer of our modern englishmen there something in our climate and our make up that make it especially true of us that idleness its own punishment an uneducated fine gentleman pay for his momentary pleasures with long and cruel intervals of be bore and out of sort to relieve these he be drive into sensual excesses which further depress his spirit his low condition while create greater need for pleasures lessen his ability to enjoy them an englishman cast of mind make him the most unsuccessful rake in the world rake term that we ll meet several time more be man whose way of life be stylish and fashionable but also promiscuous and dissolute he be in aristotle phrase at odds with himself he isn brute enough to enjoy his appetites or man enough to govern them he know and feel that what he pursue be not his true good and when he look inwards all he find be the misery that his habitual sluggishness and idleness win allow him to remedy eventually have grow odious to himself and hat his own company he join any idle group that he can not in the hope of pleasure but merely to relieve the pain of his own mind listless and uneasy in the present he have no delight in reflect on what be past or in the prospect of anything to come when after wretched lifetime of vanity and woe his animal nature be wear to the stump this man of pleasure alternate between want death and dread it he be sick of live without ever have try or know the true life of man ironically it just as well that this sort of life which be of so little benefit to its owner bring so much benefit to the public then some discussion of courage and of why there aren more disillusion minute philosophers who commit suicide crito answer because they aren sure they be right about god and the after life then socrates who be no country parson suspect that your men of pleasure be such be men of pleasure through ignorance ignorance of what of the art of compute calculate as it be mathematically he think that rake can do their sum and that because of this lack in their intellects they make wrong judgments about pleasure where their happiness depend on their make right ones don understand you do you agree that the sense perceive only sensible things do and the sense perceive only things that be present accept that too so pleasures of the understand and future pleasures aren to be judge by the sense they be not so people who judge pleasures by the sense may find themselves mistake at the bottom line he quote some line from the latin satirical poet persius about someone end up with his joint ruin by gout so that his limbs be like brittle beech tree branch lament the way he have spend his life and depress at the think of the kind of life that lie ahead of him then to get the computation right shouldn you consider all the faculties and all the kinds of pleasure take the future into account as well as the present and rat them all accord to their true value the epicureans hold that pleasure that produce greater pain or that hinder greater pleasure should be regard as pain and that pain that produce greater pleasure or prevent greater pain be to be account pleasure thus if we be to make true estimate of pleasure that great spring of action from which the conduct of life get its direction we have to compute intellectual pleasures and future ones as well as sensible pleasures and present ones and in estimate each particular pleasure we have to take into account all the pain and evils all the disgust remorse and shame that come with it and we ought to take account of the kind as well as the quantity of each pleasure let free thinker merely consider how little human pleasure consist in actual sensation and how much in prospect then let him then compare the prospect of virtuous believer with that of an unbelieving rake euphranor briefly join in and lysicles respond sharply that the free thinkers calculate that what you call good christian must be unfit for the world affairs thus while you compute yourselves out of pleasure others compute you out of business then further conversation about the personal character of minute philosophers and then about how they spread their word the role of writers in this the effect on the young of free think ideas savage anecdotes about this by crito then wouldn there always be rake and rogues even if we didn make them believe me the world always be and always will be the same as long as men be men deny that the world be always the same human nature to use alciphron comparison be like land better or worse depend on how it be manage and what seed or principles be sow in it agree there might be bad men through the force of corrupt appetites and unruly passions even if nobody accept your tenets but when to the force of appetite and passion men add the force of opinion and be wicked on principle there will be more men who be wicked and they will be more incurably and outrageously wicked the error of lively rake lie in his passions and may be reform but the dry rogue who set himself up in judgments be incorrigible more discussion of the character of minute philosophers their place in history and other relate topics then we have maxim namely that each should take care of one should take care of himself alas lysicles you wrong your own character you minute philosophers want to get the world and yourselves to accept you as cunning self interest men but can anything be more disinterested not self interest than to give up all concern with the theoretical pursuit of truth can anything be less cunning than to publish your discoveries to the world teach others to play the whole game and arm mankind against yourselves re play the whole game see lysicles speech well in our dialect on page to you folk who be fire with love of truth and love of liberty and grasp the whole extent of nature suggest that to those love you add love of your country forgive me for introduce such low down think would urge you to be cautious in the same way that all other discoverers projectors and makers of experiment be they never risk everything on the first trial wouldn it be prudent to try the success of your principles on small model in some remote corner of the earth for instance set up colony of atheists in monomotapa in southern africa and see how it prosper before you proceed any further at home half dozen shiploads of minute philosophers could easily be spar for such good plan in the meantime you gentlemen who have discover that there nothing to be hop or fear in an after life that conscience be nag pest that the band of government and the cement of human society be rotten things that can be dissolve and crumble into nothing by the arguments of any minute philosopher be so good as to keep these sublime discoveries to yourselves and allow all the rest of us to continue in the beliefs and ways of think establish by the laws of our country speak seriously do wish you would try your experiment among the hottentots or turks we think well of the hottentots believe them to be an unprejudiced people but afraid their diet and customs wouldn agree with our philosophers as for the turks they be bigots who have notion of god and respect for jesus christ doubt if it would be safe to venture among them then make your experiment in some other christian country we think that all other christian nations be much under the power of prejudice even our neighbour the dutch be too much prejudice in favour of their religion which their law have establish for prudent man to attempt innovations under their government on the whole it seem that no country can offer as much security and prospect of success for our scheme as england do not to mention the fact that we have already make good progress the right way to start this experiment be to wipe out the prejudice of individual persons we have carry on this work for many years work hard and skillfully at first secretly as our principles gain acceptance and as our number grow we gradually reveal ourselves and our opinions and needn tell you where we have now come to we have grub and weed and clear human nature so thoroughly that before long you ll see natural and sound ideas sprout up by themselves without any labour or teach crito report the view of wise man whom he doesn name that the worst and most unwholesome weed be this same minute philosophy from there he move to recount fable about contest in hell to select the devil who could do most harm to humanity the runner up appear as gunpowder produce great noise and destruction and fear the winner set up as pharmacist thus he pass as friend and physician through the world disguise himself with sweets and perfume and drug make his way into pharmacies and ladies cabinets and under pretence of help digestion comfort the spirit and cheer the heart he produce direct contrary effect and quietly and invisibly push great number of mankind into fatal decay decay that be fatal in the sense of be fat inevitable unstoppable he populate hell and the grave so fast that he earn the post of ruler of hell which he still hold those who please may amuse themselves with fables and allegories this be plain english liberty be good thing and we be the support of liberty it seem to me that liberty and virtue be make for each other if someone want to enslave his country the best preparation for that be vice and nothing lead to vice so surely as irreligion do simply can understand and have try how this hostility to religion can be an effect of honest view regard just and legal liberty let us examine what good your principles have do who have be the better for the instructions of these minute philosophers let us compare what we be in respect of learn loyalty honesty wealth power and public spirit with what we have be free think as it be call have grow amazingly in recent years let us see what have grow up along with it or as result of it shan list all the resultant ills that would be nasty task and on the other side there be the only bless that the minute philosophy can claim namely luxury the same bless that open up ancient rome to the world revenge the same luxury that make nation look full and fat when it actually have one foot in the grave you have this wrong our sect think and argue better than anyone about the public good of state and we have invent here discover many things that be conducive to the public good but can yet conveniently be put into practice but the public have receive one advantage from the spread of your principles namely the old roman practice of self murder this put an end to all distress stop miserable people from go on be burden to the world and to themselves you choose to make some remark about this custom little while ago page and to laugh at the irresolution of our free thinkers who couldn make up their mind to kill themselves but can tell you as matter of fact that they have often recommend it by their example as well as by arguments and that it be solely because of them that this practice useful and magnanimous as it be have be take out of the hand of lunatics and restore to the status among men of sense that it have in ancient time in whatever light you may look at it this be in fact solid benefit but the best effect of our principles be the light and truth that they have so visibly spread through the world the number of prejudice errors perplexities and contradictions that we have clear out of the mind of our fellow subject the number of hard word and intricate absurd notions that possess the mind of men before our philosophers appear in the world now even women and children have right and sound notions of things what do you say to this crito say regard these great advantage of destroy men and notions that doubt that the public gain as much by the destruction of notions as it lose by the destruction of men speak for myself have rather my wife and children all have beliefs with no real thoughts behind them and daily pronounce word without mean than that any one of them should cut her throat or leap out of window the public doesn care much about errors and nonsense as such it be less concern with whether notion be metaphysically true than with whether it will tend to produce good or evil truth itself be value by the public because it do have an influence and be felt in the course of life but the minute philosophers be not the men to whom we owe most for discoveries of that kind make this point on the basis that your notions be in fact true and in fact don think they be candidly think they be not only harmful but also false the tendency of your opinions be so bad that no good man can endure them and your arguments for them be so weak that no wise man will accept them hasn it be prove as clear as the midday sun that since the spread of our principles the more smoothly civilise sort of men have lead much happier live and have be swim in pleasure but don want to repeat things that have already prove so ll add just one point our principles bring advantage even to very small children and to women they deliver children from terrors by night and ladies from intensely bore hours by day crito fiercely attack this say that we should compute what liberate lady will give up against what she will get through the minute philosophy and that at the bottom line you shall find that empty giddy gaudy flutter thing not half so happy as butterfly or grasshopper on summer day similarly for the liberate man end with this when his sense and appetite fade and he seek refuge from his conscience in the minute philosophy the real truth about him be that he affect much believe little know nothing lysicles make couple of short interventions in the second of them say that none of this will make our principles less true crito snap back their truth be not what we be talk about our present topic be the usefulness of your principles and to decide this all we need be to get an overview of them fairly state and lay side by side there be no god or providence man be as the beasts that perish man happiness like that of the beasts consist in obey animal instincts appetites and passions all sting of conscience and sense of guilt be prejudice and errors of upbringing religion be state trick vice be beneficial to the public the soul of man be corporeal and dissolve like flame or vapour man be machine drive accord to the laws of motion so he do not act and can be guilty of anything wise man evaluate and choose all his action in this life on the basis of his own individual self interest it seem that these opinions and others like them be the tenets of minute philosopher who be himself accord to his own principles an organ play on by perceptible object ball swat about by appetites and passions he be so acute mind that he can maintain all this by skillful reason so sharp sight and penetrate and deep that he can discover that the only true wisdom be the most self interest secret cunning to round out this character sketch this ingenious piece of clockwork have no source of action within itself and deny that it have or can have single free think or motion set itself up as the protector of liberty and argue earnestly for free think the moment crito stop speak lysicles address himself to euphranor and me crito he say have take vast amount of trouble but have convince me of only one solitary thing namely that haven hope of convince him never in my whole life have meet with man so deeply immerse in prejudice leave it others to pull him out of the mire but have better hop of convince you speak for myself say can answer that my eye and ears be always open to conviction attend to everything that be say and my over all final judgment whether right or wrong will at least be quite impartial crito be bolder than be undertake in this way to scold and lecture philosopher for my part always find it easier to learn than to teach so ll ask for your help in rid me of some worry about the practical effect of your opinions topic that haven be able to get on top of though ever so will when this be do perhaps we still win tread in exactly the same step perhaps we win even walk on the same road but we shan keep come into direct collision with one another he then present set of feeble examples in support of the general thesis that extremes lead to opposite extremes in the natural world and also he add in the civil world where power produce licence and licence produce power bigots make atheists and atheists make bigots the threat be that if the success of the minute philosophy lead to lax government and great licentiousness there will be reaction take the country to the opposite extreme of something like what we might call fascism euphranor then launch into another worry that have about the tendency of your opinions it be than an england cleanse of protestant christianity would create spiritual vacuum not his phrase that would be fill by many subtle and effective covert missionaries for roman catholicism lysicles reply that the minute philosophers don prefer any religion to any other and that if roman catholicism become the enforce orthodoxy of england they would all go along with it and what about their minute philosophy oh we should have more than ever of that for we should keep it all to ourselves crito remark that the minute philosophers tend to make friends of the jesuits ignorantly unaware that the jesuits be subtle and sophisticate enough to make dupe of the minute philosophers then here crito pause and fix his eye on alciphron who during this whole conversation have sit thoughtful and attentive without say word sometimes seem dissatisfy at what lysicles advance at other time apparently serene and please as though approve some better think of his own but the day be now far advance and alciphron propose to adjourn the argument till the follow day then he say shall put matter on new foundation and in light that be so full and clear that be sure it will give entire satisfaction so we switch to talk about other things eat our picnic meal stroll on the beach and return to crito home in the cool of the even third dialogue wednesday the follow day as we sit around the tea table in summer parlour face the garden alciphron turn down his cup sit back in his chair and say our sect be the only one on earth that have the special privilege of not be tie down by any principles while other philosophers declare themselves to be commit to certain doctrines ours assert noble freedom differ from one another and often single philosopher differ from himself among its other advantage this method of proceed make us of all men the hardest to refute you may show particular tenet of ours to be wrong but this affect only those who maintain that thesis and only for as long as they maintain it some free thinkers dogmatize more than others do and on some point more than on others the doctrine of the usefulness of vice be something we be not all agree on some of us be great admirers of virtue others have problems regard vice and virtue speak for myself think that the doctrine maintain yesterday by lysicles be an ingenious bite of theory but for various reason incline not to accept it and rather to join the virtue side in that debate that put me in the company of very small part of our sect but it may be the most thoughtful and praiseworthy part of it anyway after look into it fairly and very carefully think that we ought to prefer virtue to vice and that in do so we would be do good things for the public and for the reputation of our philosophers so you should know that number of free thinkers men who haven grain of religion in their make up be men of the most scrupulous honour which make them men of virtue honour be noble unpolluted source of virtue with absolutely no fear self interest or superstition mix in with it it have all the advantage of religion with none of the drawbacks see note on page so honour be the source of virtue ii thing can be the source of itself iii so the source have to be distinguish from whatever it be the source of iv so honour be one thing and virtue be another agree virtuous action be the effect and honour be their source or cause tell me now what the role of honour be in this be honour the will that produce the virtuous action as their efficient cause or the final cause for which they be produce or right reason that govern and control them or what the action be about or do you use honour to stand for faculty or appetite each of these be suppose to be in one way or another source of human action honour be none of them then please give me some notion or definition of it alciphron think for while and then answer that he define honour to be principle of virtuous action euphranor reply as understand it the word principle have several sense sometimes by principles we mean the part of which whole be compose and into which it can be resolve or analyse it in this sense that the elements be call principles of compound body and word and syllables and letter be the principles of speech sometimes by principle we mean small individual seed the growth or gradual unfold of which produce an organic body animal or vegetable in its proper size and shape principles in other contexts be suppose to be certain fundamental theorems in arts and sciences in religion and politics now when you say honour be principle of virtue in which if any of these sense be you use principle alciphron reply that he didn mean it in any of those sense and that he define honour to be certain ardour or enthusiasm that glow in the breast of gallant man at that time enthusiasm tend to mean something close to fanaticism which sometimes replace it in this version in the present context however it be safer to let the word stand euphranor remark that it be always legitimate to put definition in place of the term define be this allow he ask it be then can we say that man of honour be an ardent or heat man or an enthusiast alciphron reply that there no point in such exactness that pedants may dispute and define but they can never reach the high sense of honour that distinguish the fine gentleman this honour he say be thing to be felt rather than explain crito see that alciphron couldn bear be press any further on that matter and want to give some satisfaction to euphranor say that he wouldn undertake to explain such delicate matter but that he would repeat to them part of conversation he once hear between minute philosopher and christian on the same subject the report dialogue which be quite short represent the free thinker honour as disgracefully meagre affair pretty much limit to pay one gamble debts and engage in duel when challenge don want the opinion of someone of whom know nothing tell me your own judgment about what honour be base on your own observations of men of honour well from everything that have hear or see could never find that honour consider as an action stimulus distinct from conscience religion reason and virtue be anything but an empty name really do think that those who base their conduct on the notion of honour have less virtue than other men and that what they seem to have as their substitute for virtue be derive either from the fashion of the day or from conscience that have without their know it retain faint trace of the religious principles that be drum into them in their childhood these two principles source seem to account for everything that in those gentlemen men of fashion who be full of animal life be bluster braggarts when it come to morality they would blush to let anyone think that they be afraid of conscience they go on about honour and want to be know as men of honour rather than as conscientious or honest men but so far as can see this shiny glow of honour with nothing of conscience or religion beneath it to give it life and substance be no better than meteor or sunset cloud have confuse idea that honour have lot to do with truth and that men of honour be the greatest enemies of all hypocrisy falsehood and disguise quite the contrary an unbeliever who think he have the most scrupulous honour without have the least grain of faith or religion will pretend to be christian take any test join in any act of worship kneel pray receive the sacrament all to serve his own self interest he win feel that his honour be at stake when he solemnly declare and promise in the face of god and the world that he will love his wife and forsake all others keep only to her while have not the faintest intention of keep any part of his vow as he show to everyone as soon as he get her and her money in his power we have notion here in the country that call man of honour liar be the nastiest thing one could do and very risky thing to do that be very true such man doesn mind lie but he hat to be call liar alciphron have peacefully hear all this say the term free thinker cover men of very different sort and sentiments so that free thinkers can be say strictly to constitute single sect with particular system of positive and distinct opinions we do indeed all agree on certain point of unbelief certain negative principles and this agreement do in way bring us together under the common idea of one sect but those negative principles as they take root in men who differ in age temperament and upbringing produce wide variety of tendencies opinions and character don think that our greatest strength lie in the libertines and mere men of honour who constitute the majority of us no we have among us philosophers of very different type enquire thinkers who be govern not by such crude things as sense and custom but by highly principled virtue and elevate morals and the less religious they be the more virtuous an unbeliever be the best qualify person for virtue of the high and disinterested not self interest kind because it be low down and selfish thing to be virtuous through fear or hope as believers be the notion of god who maintain future state of reward and punishments may indeed tempt or scare cowardly men into behaviour that be contrary to the natural tendency of their souls but it will never produce genuine virtue to get to the bottom of things to analyse virtue into its ultimate elements and settle scheme of morals on its true basis you have to grasp that an idea of beauty be natural to the mind of man all men want beauty they be please and delight with it for its own sake purely from an instinct of nature man doesn need arguments to make him identify and approve what be beautiful it strike him at first sight and attract him without reason and just as this beauty be find in the physical feature of material things so also there different though analogous kind of beauty an order symmetry handsomeness in the moral world and just as the eye perceive one sort of beauty so do the mind by certain interior sense perceive the other sort and this sense talent or faculty be always sharpest and purest in the noblest mind just as we unhesitatingly pronounce dress to be fine or physical movement graceful we can with the same free untutored judgment tell straight off whether someone behaviour be beautiful to detect and enjoy this kind of beauty you need delicate and fine taste but when someone have this natural taste that all he need he have no need for anything else as principle to convince him of the value of beauty or as motive to induce him to love virtue and every rational creature have something of this taste or sense though in vary degrees all rational be be by nature social they be draw towards one another by natural affections they unite into families club party and commonwealths by mutual sympathy just as the various part of our body guide by the sensitive soul contribute to our animal function and be connect to make one whole organism so also the various part of these rational systems guide by this moral or interior sense be hold together have fellow feel do support and protect each other and jointly co operate towards single end that the source of our joy in society our inclination towards do good to our kind the approval and delight we have when we see other men virtuous deeds or think back on our own by think about the fitness and order of the part of moral system operate regularly and hold together by benevolent affections the mind of man achieve the highest notion of beauty excellence and perfection hold by this sublime idea our philosophers infinitely despise and pity anyone who propose or accept any other motive to virtue self interest be low down and ungenerous thing destroy the merit of virtue and falsehood of every kind be inconsistent with the genuine spirit of philosophy so your love for moral beauty and your passion for truth as such win let you patiently endure those fraudulent impositions upon mankind god the immortality of the soul and reward and punishments in an after life which purport to promote virtue but really destroy it destroy true virtue and at the same time contradict and belittle your noble theories thus tend to disturb and agitate men mind and fill them with doom hop and empty terrors men first thoughts and natural notions be the best in moral matter mankind doesn need to be preach or reason or frighten into virtue which be such natural and congenial thing for every human soul and if this be the case as it certainly be it follow that all society aim be secure without religion and that an unbeliever offer promise of be the most virtuous man in true sublime and heroic sense while you say these things alciphron feel state of my soul like the tremble of one lute when the unison string of another be pluck doubtless there be beauty of the mind charm in virtue symmetry and proportion in the moral world the ancients know this moral beauty by the name of honestum if we want to know what its force and influence be it may be worthwhile to inquire how it be understand and depict by those who first consider it and give it name honestum accord to aristotle be what be praiseworthy accord to plato it be what be pleasant or profitable mean pleasant to reasonable mind and profitable to its true interest euphranor give the key word here in greek as well as in english or in one case honestum latin see note on page when we think of an action as praiseworthy our think go beyond the bare action itself and take in the opinion of others concern it ii so this isn sufficient basis or source of virtue for man to act on in case where he think that his conduct can be observe by any other think be iii when man do something because he find it pleasant or profitable we have to think that he ll refrain from do it or even do its opposite if that have prospect of greater pleasure or profit iv so it follow from this that the beauty of virtue in either aristotle or plato sense be not sufficient to get sensual and worldly mind men to act virtuously so it follow that hope of reward and fear of punishment be extremely useful in get the balance of pleasant and profitable to swing down on the side of virtue thus bring much benefit to human society alciphron appeal gentlemen you be witness of this unfair proceed of euphranor who argue against us on the basis of plato and aristotle account of the beauty of virtue account that have nothing to do with our view the philosophers of our sect rise above all praise pleasure and self interest when they be capture and bowl over by the sublime idea of the beauty of virtue apologise reply euphranor for suppose that today minute philosophers think like those ancient sag but tell me alciphron since you don adopt plato or aristotle account of it what do you understand the beauty of virtue to be define it explain it make me understand your mean that so we can argue about the same thing if we don do that we ll never reach conclusion some things be better understand by definitions and descriptions but have always observe that those who do least well concern the beauty of virtue be those who try to define explain and dispute about it moral beauty be so unique and abstract so subtle fine and fleet that it doesn survive be handle and inspect like jug or boot so you ll have to allow me my philosophic liberty to take my stand within the general and indefinite sense rather than enter into precise and detail account of this beauty possibly lose sight of it and also possibly give you leverage for criticize and infer and raise doubt query and difficulties about something that as clear as the sun when nobody reason upon it be you then say alciphron that the notion of moral beauty be clearest when it be not think about say that it something to be felt rather than understand certain je ne sais quoi french don know what we engage with it not through our concept manage capacities but through special sense which be properly call the moral sense because it be adapt to the perception of moral beauty as the eye be adapt to colour or the ear to sound have no doubt that men naturally have certain instinctive sensations or emotions that make them amiable and useful to each other examples be fellow feel with the distress tenderness for our offspring affection towards our friends our neighbour and our country indignation against what be base cruel or unjust these emotions be implant in the human soul along with various other factor fear and appetites aversions and desire with different mind differ in which of these be strongest and uppermost doesn it then seem to be very uncertain guide in morals for man to follow his emotion or inward feel if this be the general rule wouldn it be sure to lead different men in different directions depend on which appetite or emotion be prevalent don deny that and doesn it also follow that duty and virtue be more likely to be practise if men be lead by reason and judgment balance low and sensual pleasures against those of higher kind present losses against future gain and the discomfort and disgust of every vice against the delightful practice of the opposite virtue and the please thoughts and hop that go with it or can there be stronger motive to virtue than the belief that all things consider it be in every man true self interest tell you euphranor we despise the virtue of the man who calculate and deliberate and must have reason for be virtuous the refine moralists among the free thinkers be enchant and carry away by the abstract beauty of virtue they love virtue only for its own sake try an experiment on the first man you meet propose to him villainous or unjust action get his initial sense of the matter and you ll find that he detest it he may indeed later on be mislead by arguments or overpower by temptation but his original unpremeditated genuine thoughts be right and orthodox how can we account for this except through moral sense which when leave to itself have as quick and true perception of the beauty and ugliness of human action as the eye have of colour mightn this be adequately explain in term of conscience affection emotion education reason custom religion for all know those source of moral behaviour may be what you metaphorically call moral sense what call moral sense be strictly literally and truly sense and be different in kind from all the things you have just list all men have it though some may fail to be aware of it in themselves euphranor smile and say alciphron have make discoveries where least expect him to in regard to everything else would hope to learn from him but for knowledge of myself of the faculties and power of my own mind would have look at home and might have look there for good long time without find this new talent even now after be tutor still can understand it must say that alciphron speak in way that be too high fly and obscure for topic that ought to be the most clearly understand of all have often hear that your deepest experts and oldest and most experience theoreticians be the most obscure lysicles be young and speak plainly if he would favour us with his view of the moral sense that might perhaps be nearer to level at which can understand lysicles shake his head and in solemn and earnest manner address us all gentlemen he say alciphron stand on his own legs have no part in these refine notions he be now commit to defend if must subdue my emotions take things in an abstract way think deeply love virtue in short if must be an enthusiast the deference owe to the laws of my country make me choose to be an enthusiast in their way besides it be better to be an enthusiast for some end than to be an enthusiast for none this doctrine of virtue base not on religion but on moral sense have all the solid inconvenience of the christian doctrine without its distract hop and prospect wasn count on lysicles to back me up in this matter which after all doesn need his help different topics require different treatments subject may be too obscure for the dry and pedantic method of definition and distinction draw or it may be too simple for it and we may know too little about subject to be able to make it plainer by talk about it or we may know too much for further talk to be any help for my part believe that if matter be fairly state the rational satisfaction the peace of mind the inward comfort and conscientious joy that good christian find in good action would not be find to fall short of all the ecstasy rapture and enthusiasm that be suppose to come from that high and undescribed source the moral sense seriously can any ecstasy be higher any rapture more affect than what come from the love of god and man from conscience clear of sin from an inward discharge of duty with the secret delight trust and hope that go along with it euphranor we who be devote to the truth don envy the groundless joy and mistake hop of christian we pity them and as for conscience and rational pleasure how can we allow conscience without allow vindictive god and how can we suppose that the charm of virtue consist in any pleasure or benefit that come from virtuous action without thereby give great advantage to the christian religion which seem to arouse its believers to virtue by the self interest pursuit of the highest pleasures as reward alas if we grant this we would be open the door to all those rusty old speeches about the necessity and usefulness of the great article of faith the immortality of the soul an after life reward and punishments and other such explode notions accord to our system and principles those factor may perhaps produce low popular self interest kind of virtue but it be bind to destroy and extinguish virtue in the sublime and heroic sense of the word what you re say now be perfectly intelligible wish understand your main principle as well so you be seriously at loss can you really have no notion of beauty or have it but not know beauty to be lovable in itself and for itself tell me alciphron do all mankind have the same notion of beautiful face the physical beauty of human be seem to be rather mix and various but isn there steady standard of beauty with regard to other things doesn every human mind have the idea of order harmony and proportion alciphron it weakness of mine that tend to get lose when the talk be abstract and general particular things be better suit to my faculties so let us stay with the object of the sense and try to discover what it be that make them beautiful and then use these sensible things as ladder climb to the level of moral and intellectual beauty so please tell me what be it that we call beauty in the object of sense alciphron answer would as euphranor point out allow for beauty in taste and smell so he try again with an account that limit beauty to what can be see alciphron after short pause say that beauty consist in certain symmetry or proportion please to the eye be this proportion the very same in everything or be it different in different kinds of things different doubtless the proportion of an ox would not be beautiful in horse and we see also in inanimate things that the beauty of table chair door consist in different proportion see note on page this proportion imply the relation of one thing to another ii and these relations be base on size and shape iii for the proportion to be right those mutual relations of size and shape in the part must be such as to make the whole thing complete and perfect in its kind iv thing be say to be perfect in its kind when it fit the purpose for which it be make so the part have to be relate and adjust to one another in such way that they can best work together to make the whole thing work properly vi but compare part with one another view them as belong to one whole and relate this whole to its use or purpose seem to be the work of reason vii so strictly speak proportion be not perceive by the sense of sight but only by reason through the mean of sight viii so beauty in your sense of it be an object not of the eye but of the mind ix so the eye alone can see that chair be handsome or door well proportion that seem to follow but not clear on this point let see if there any difficulty in it that chair you be sit in do you think it could be regard as well proportion or handsome if it didn have that height depth breadth and wasn adjust so as to be comfortable to sit in it could not so the beauty or symmetry of chair can be take in unless you know what the chair be for and relate its shape to that intend use and that can be do by the eye alone it work for the judgment so it be one thing to see an object and another to detect its beauty admit this to be true he now repeat the point with the example of door the standards for what make door beautifully proportion reflect the fact that doors be for humans to go through alciphron agree then tell me alciphron isn there something truly decent and beautiful in dress no doubt there be if we want to get an idea of beauty in dress be anyone more likely to give it to us than painters and sculptors whose business it be to aim at graceful representations believe not well then let examine the draperies of the great master in these arts for example how they be accustom to clothe matron or man of rank he then launch into fierce attack on current standards of dress the greeks and romans dress themselves in become manner whereas our gothic gentry have adopt standards and fashion that be absurd and ridiculous the reason for this and alciphron agree be that instead of consult use reason and convenience the moderns have go in for fancy the unnatural parent of monsters he conclude that the beauty of dress depend on its serve certain end and use euphranor then launch into fresh set of examples quote virgil on beautiful horse and then report ancient greek ideas about what make pillar beautiful there follow long speech about architectural standards all of which be aim at show the subordinate relative nature of beauty architectural beauty he say reflect not only the use to which the build be to be put but also certain relationships to natural things the proportion that make for beauty in greek pillar have definite relationship to the proportion of well shape human body euphranor sum up the grand distinction between ancient greek and gothic architecture be that the gothic be fantastical and mostly not base on nature or reason necessity or use these be what account for all the beauty grace and ornament of the architecture of ancient greece what euphranor have say confirm the opinion always entertain that the rule of architecture as of all other arts that flourish among the greeks be base on truth and nature and good sense he then expound the point that the ancients didn adhere slavishly to their rule of proportion etc be will to depart from them whenever the particular distance position elevation or dimension of the build or its part seem to require it he contrast careful and rational departure from rule with the capricious fantasticalness of contemporary architecture now need something to be make clearer namely what the point be of this architectural detour weren we enquire into beauty we be well what do you think alciphron doesn some real principle of beauty have to be at work when something please us here and now and also give pleasure two thousand years ago and two thousand miles away yes it do and isn that how things stand with respect to sound piece of architecture nobody deny it architecture the noble offspring of judgment and fancy be gradually form in the most civilise and inform countries of asia and in egypt greece and italy it be value and admire by the most flourish state and most renowned monarchs who at vast expense improve it and bring it to perfection it seem more than any other art to be specially involve with order proportion and symmetry so isn it reasonable for us to think that architecture be the art that be most likely to help us get some rational notion of the je ne sais quoi in beauty and haven we learn from our detour that there be no beauty without proportion and that proportion be to be judge as sound and true only to the extent that they relate appropriately to some certain use or purpose this potential usefulness be what basically make them please and charm admit all this to be true in the next three speeches principle be use in sense relate to in euphranor speech on page think of it as mean approximately generator or source of energy give this doctrine like to know what beauty can be find in moral system that have be form tie together and govern by chance fate or any other blind unthinking principle without think there can be no purpose or design without purpose there can be any usefulness and without usefulness there can be any of the fitness of proportion from which beauty spring can we suppose that the world be permeate throughout by certain vital principle of beauty order and harmony without suppose god who inspect punish and reward the moral action of men without suppose the immortality of the soul or an after life in brief without accept any part of what be commonly call faith worship and religion be this principle that you be suppose think one or not if not then it be all of piece with chance or fate which be argue against moment ago if it do think then like alciphron to tell me what be so beautiful in moral system head by supreme think be that doesn protect the innocent punish the wicked or reward the virtuous he go on eloquently and at length about the beauty of moral system in which everyone see himself as the member of great city whose author and founder be god and where all conduct aim at the noblest end namely the complete happiness or well be of the whole then there will be great beauty in system of spirit that be subordinate to god will and under his direction with him govern them by laws and direct them by methods that be suitable to wise and good end but how can there be beauty in an incoherent system that be govern by chance or in blind system that be govern by fate or in any system where god doesn preside where there be no think there be no design and therefore no order and therefore no beauty contrast these two scenes man be conscious that his will be inwardly conform to god will which produce order and harmony in the universe and conduct the whole by the most just methods to the best end that give beautiful idea but then man be conscious that his virtue be overlook neglect or hold against him by men and not regard or reward by god that this world have treat him badly and he have no hope or prospect of be better treat in another world where the beauty in that what pleasure can we get from think about it and how could any sane person think that spread this idea of our moral situation be the way to spread or propagate virtue in the world an enthusiast may entertain himself with visions and fine talk about such system but when it come to be consider by careful thinkers with cool head don think they will find any beauty or perfection in it and they win think that such moral system can possibly be the work of the same divine hand as the natural world throughout which there shin so much order harmony and proportion all this serve to confirm me in my opinion say earlier page that regard this high level beauty of morality man first thoughts be best and that we ll risk lose sight of it if we examine inspect and reason about it that there be such thing can be doubt when we realize that some of our philosophers today have high sense of virtue without the least notion of religion that be clear proof of the usefulness and effectiveness of our principles grant that some minute philosophers be virtuous we may venture to question the cause of their virtue you attribute it to an inexplicable enthusiastic notion of moral beauty think it come as euphranor say from personal temperament custom and religious education but anyway assign what beauty you please to virtue in an irreligious system it can be less in religious one unless you hold that virtue charm diminish as her dowry increase take all the motives of every sort that an unbeliever can possibly get from the beauty of virtue believer can have them too as well as other motives that an unbeliever doesn have so it be obvious that those of your sect who have moral virtue don get it from their special free think doctrines which serve only to lessen the motives to virtue good free thinkers be less good and bad ones be more bad than they would have be if they be believers it seem to me that those heroic unbelieving lovers of abstract moral beauty be much to be pity and much to be amaze by lysicles break in impatiently gentlemen he say you shall have my whole thoughts about this topic plain and unvarnished everything that be say about moral sense or about moral beauty in any mean of that phrase whether say by alciphron or euphranor or anyone else regard as basically mere window dress and pretence the beautiful and the decent be outward things and be relative and superficial they have no effect in the dark as they would if there be something solid about them they be merely show piece to argue over and make speeches about as some of the self announce members our sect be accustom to do orthodox though they be about other things but if one of them get into power you wouldn find him such fool as euphranor imagine he would soon show that he have learn that the love of one country be prejudice that mankind be rogues and hypocrites and that it would be folly to sacrifice oneself for the sake of the like of them that everything that matter relate to this life and that because to every man this life mean his own life it clearly follow that charity begin at home claim be make of benevolence to mankind but what wise people put into practice be benevolence to themselves among our free thinker philosophers the livelier ones don hesitate to accept these maxims openly and as for the more solemn ones we can guess what they must really think if they be true to their principles whatever effect pure theory may have on certain minority of very unusual mind or in some other part of the world really do think that in england now reason religion and law be all together little enough to get people to act in accordance with their consciences and that it would be downright stupid to think that without reason religion and law men would be in love with the golden mean in love with temperate way of life one in which extremes be avoid indeed my countrymen may be even less incline to be like that than others be because in the make up of an english mind there be certain hot eagerness that carry us to the sad extreme in religion to fanaticism in free think to atheism in liberty to rebellion he go on to say that the english like other northern people don go in for beauty much and when they try they make hash of it wind up but in no case be it to be hop that the beautiful he say it in greek will be the lead idea of the great majority who have quick sense strong emotions and blunt intellects the fewer they be the more we should respect and admire such philosophers whose souls be transport by this sublime idea of moral beauty but then one might expect from such philosophers enough good sense and philanthropy to make them keep their tenets to themselves and consider the situation of their weak brethren who be more strongly affect by notions of another kind than that of the beauty of pure disinterested virtue consider the example of cratylus what follow be aim at the third earl of shaftesbury who be berkeley target not always fairly treat through much of this work he be prejudice against the christian religion be of an unsound constitution have rank in society higher than most men can even aim at have fortune equal to his rank have little capacity for sensual vices or temptation to dishonest ones he talk himself or think he have into stoic enthusiasm about the beauty of virtue then under the pretence of make men heroically virtuous he try by undermine religion to destroy the mean of make them reasonably and humanly so this be clear example of the fact that neither birth nor book nor conversation can introduce knowledge of the world into conceited mind that will attend only to itself and look at mankind only in its own mirror cratylus be lover of liberty and of his country he aim to make men uncorrupt and virtuous on the purest and most disinterested principles it true that the main aim of all his write as he himself tell us be to assert the reality of beauty and charm in moral subject as well as in natural ones to demonstrate taste that he think more effective than principle to recommend morals on the same basis as manners and in this way to make progress in moral philosophy by give it the same basis as the notions of what be agreeable and socially acceptable as for religious qualms the belief in an after life of reward and punishments and such matter this great man doesn hesitate to declare that the liberal polish and refine part of mankind must consider them only as children tales and pastimes of the vulgar so for the sake of the better sort of people he have in his great goodness and wisdom think of something else namely taste or flavour this he assure us be something that will influence people because accord to him anyone who have any impression of gentility or polish be so acquaint with the fittingness and grace of things as to be easily bowl over by the think of it his conduct seem to be about as wise as that of monarch who announce that in his kingdom there be no jail and no executioner to enforce the laws but that it be beautiful to obey the laws and that in do so men will taste the pure delight that result from order and decorum yet isn it true that certain ancient philosophers ones of great note hold the same opinion as cratylus declare that no one count as good man if he practise virtue for any reason except that it be beautiful yes think some of the ancients say things that give rise to this opinion aristotle distinguish between two ways in which someone can be good man one he call agathos or simply good the other he call kalos kagathos these be hard to translate into english but his sense be plainly this agathos be the man to whom the good things of nature be good accord to aristotle things that be vulgarly regard as the greatest goods riches honour power and bodily perfections be indeed good by nature and yet they happen to be hurtful and bad to some people because of their bad habit so that those natural goods be not good for fool an unjust man or an intemperate man any more than sick man be help by get nourishment that be proper for those who be in good health and kalos kagathos be the man in whom be to be find all things worthy and decent and praiseworthy purely as such and for their own sake and who practise virtue solely because of his love of virtue innate beauty aristotle also observe that there be certain political way of think and behave that the spartans and others have who think that virtue be to be value and practise because of the natural advantage that come with it this make them good men he say but they don have the supreme consummate virtue this make it clear that accord to aristotle someone can be good man without believe that virtue its own reward or be move to virtue only by the sense of moral beauty it also clear that he distinguish the political virtue of nations which the public be everywhere concern to maintain from this high mind and theoretical kind of virtue notice also that his high level kind of virtue be consistent with suppose providence that inspect and reward the virtues of the best men he say if the gods care at all about human affairs as they seem to it seem reasonable to suppose that they be most delight with the part of our nature that be most excellent and most like their own natures namely our mind and that they will reward those who chiefly love and cultivate what be most dear to them he remark that the majority of mankind be naturally incline to be awe not by shame but by fear and to abstain from vicious conduct not because of its ugliness but only because of the punishment it bring all this show us very clearly what aristotle would have think of those who would set to work to lessen or destroy mankind hop and fear in order to make them virtuous purely because of the beauty of virtue well whatever aristotle and his followers think isn it certain that the stoics maintain this doctrine in its highest sense assert that the beauty of virtue be all sufficient that virtue be her own reward that only virtue could make man happy despite all the things that be vulgarly regard as the greatest woes and miseries of human life and they hold all this while also believe that the soul of man be some kind of material thing which at death be dissipate like flame or vapour yes the stoics do sometimes talk as if they believe the soul to be mortal in deal with this topic in one of his letter seneca speak much like minute philosopher but in several other place he declare himself to have the outright opposite opinion assert that men souls after death rise into the heavens and look down on earth crito then talk learnedly about marcus aurelius he sometimes speak of the soul as perish or scatter but for him the soul be rather low part of man to be distinguish from his mind or govern principle at man death accord to him the mind remain intact it be particle of god which go back whole to the star and the divinity conclude thus along with all his magnificent lessons and splendid view about the force and beauty of virtue marcus be positive about the existence of god in the strict sense of providence inspect and take care of human affairs despite their high style therefore the stoics can be say to have reduce every motive for live virtuously to just one the beauty of virtue in such way as to attempt to destroy people belief in the immortality of the soul and providence that hand out reward and punishments and anyway suppose that the disinterested stoics do make virtue its own and its only reward take this in the most rigid and absolute sense what do that imply for those of us who be not stoics if we adopt all the principles of that sect accept their notions of good and evil their famous indifference to suffer in short set ourselves up as complete stoics that may enable us to maintain this doctrine of virtue for its own sake with better grace at least it will fit consistently into our whole stoic scheme of things but if you borrow this splendid patch from the stoics hop to make big impression by insert it into modern composition spice with the wit and notions of the present day you ll make an impression all right but on the mind of wise man it may not be the impression you intend though must admit that although embroider stoic patch with joke ought to make you look ridiculous you might get away with it because the present age be very indulgent to everything that aim at mockery of religion not everyone like humorous write and not everyone can produce them the truth be that the variety in readers taste require variety of kinds of writers our sect have provide for this with great judgment to spread our word to people of the more serious sort we have men who can reason and argue deeply and well for the run of the mill general read public we have writers who produce lengthy rhetorically persuasive piece and for men of rank and social polish we have the finest and wittiest mockers in the world whose ridicule be the sure test of truth this refer to shaftesbury who in his book characteristics of men manners opinions time write about wit and humour in philosophy see note on page no doubt that ingenious mockers be knowledgeable men ii they know about the copernican theory of the planets the circulation of the blood and so on iii they believe that there be land in the far south of the southern hemisphere that there be mountains on the moon that the earth move iv if five or six centuries ago man have maintain these notions among the clever wits at an english court they would have be receive with ridicule whereas now it would be ridiculous to ridicule them vi yet truth be the same then as it be now vii so it seem that ridicule be not such secure test of truth as you gentlemen imagine one thing we do know our mockery and sarcasm infuriate the black tribe of priests and theologians and that be our comfort something else that it may be worthwhile for you to know men who be double over with laughter may be applaud piece of mockery that they ll find contemptible when they recover from their laugh fit well anyway this much be certain our clever men make convert by deride the principles of religion and can assure you that mockery be the most successful and please method of convince someone these author laugh men out of their religion as the latin poet horace laugh them out of their vices but bigot can enjoy their wit indeed he can detect it crito speak slightingly of wit without wisdom then move back to the centre of their topic of conversation cite examples from ancient rome of good able people whose attitude to virtue involve their belief in an after life in which virtue be reward alciphron reply that these men be very well for their time but that they didn achieve the high level kind of virtue that our modern free thinkers have so it should seem that virtue flourish more than ever among us it should and this abundant virtue be to be explain by the way in which your profound writers go about recommend it this grant but you have admit that enthusiastic lovers of virtue be not majority in your sect but only small select minority alciphron didn answer this but crito step in to make true estimate of the worth and growth of modern virtue he say to euphranor what you should go by be not the number of virtuous men but rather the quality of their virtue and the virtue of these refine free think theorists be so pure and genuine that very little of it go long way in fact it be invaluable there no comparison between it and the reasonable self interest virtue of the english of earlier time or of the spartans turn of phrase which could mean that this kind of morality be very powerful and so wonderful as to be above all price and incomparably better than the morality of the spartans etc but which could instead mean that the less we see of it the better and it be worthless and be it incomparably worse that the morality of the spartans etc see note on page there be diseases of the soul as well as of the body ii the diseases of the soul be vicious habit iii and just as bodily ailments be cure by medicine mental ailments be cure by philosophy iv so it seem that philosophy be medicine for the soul of man the way we judge concern medicine decide which ones to prefer be from the effect they bring about vi suppose that in the middle of an epidemic new physician condemn the know establish practice and recommend another method of cure and suppose that some people have plausible things to say in support of this proposal wouldn you be incline to let your attitude to it be govern by whatever difference it make to the mortality figure all you be do be create confusion and take us away from our topic this remind me of my friend lamprocles who need only one argument against unbelievers have notice he tell me that as unbelief grow so do corruption of every kind as well as new vices this simple observation of matter of fact be enough to make him fill the mind of his children from an early age with the principles of religion despite the protest of many clever men the new theories that our clever moderns have try to substitute for religion have run their full course in our time and have produce their effect on the mind and conduct of men that men be men be sure maxim but it equally sure that englishmen be not the same men that they be and you don need me to tell you whether they be better or worse more or less virtuous than they use to be everyone can see and judge that for himself whatever the consequences may be can never bring myself to agree with those who measure truth by convenience the only god worship be truth wherever it lead shall follow so you have passion for truth undoubtedly for all truths for all to know them or to publish them both what would you busily correct the procedures of an enemy who be go about his attack in the wrong way would you help an enrage man to take out his sword in such case common sense tell one how to behave so common sense should be consult about whether truth be salutary or hurtful fit to be declare or fit to be conceal how you would have me conceal and stifle the truth and keep it to myself be that what you aim at only draw an obvious conclusion from things you say as for myself don believe that your opinions be true you do but if you be go to be consistent with yourself you shouldn think it necessary or wise to publish hurtful truths just because they be true what service can it do mankind to lessen the motives to virtue and what harm can it do to increase them none in the world but have to say that can square the accept notions of god and providence with my understand and be just naturally revolt by the lowness of pretend not to notice falsehood shall we therefore appeal to truth and examine the reason that hold you back from believe in god and providence with all my heart but that be enough for just now let make this the subject of our next conversation fourth dialogue thursday as look out of my window early the next morning saw alciphron walk in the garden with all the sign of man in deep think go down to him alciphron say this early and profound meditation frighten me why because would be sorry to be convince that there be no god the think of anarchy in nature be more shock to me than the think of anarchy in civil life because natural concern be more important than civil ones and be the basis of all the others grant reply alciphron that some inconvenience might follow from disprove the existence of god but as for what you say of fright and shock all that be nothing but prejudice mere prejudice men form an idea or fanciful picture in their own mind and then bow down and worship it notions govern mankind but no other notion have take such deep root or spread so widely as the notion of god govern the world so it an heroic achievement by philosophy to unthrone this imaginary monarch and banish all those fear and spectres that only the light of reason can dispel it will be my role say to stand by as have do up to now take note of everything that happen during this memorable event the attempt of less than six feet tall minute philosopher to dethrone the monarch of the universe they kick this around little and then be join by euphranor and by crito who remark that with alciphron have make such an early start we can expect to see atheism place in the best light and support by the strongest arguments then they get straight on with it not even find somewhere to sit down the existence of god be subject on which countless commonplaces have be utter there no need for me to repeat them so allow me lay down certain rule and limitations so as to shorten this conversation the aim of debate be to persuade so anything that win persuade should be leave out of our debate here be three limitations on arguments against me can be persuade by metaphysical arguments such as those from the idea of an all perfect be or from the absurdity of an infinite chain of cause have always find arguments of this sort dry and thin and because they aren suit to my way of think they may puzzle me but they ll never convince me can be persuade by the authority either of past age or our present time the authority of mankind in general or of particular wise men none of that count for much with man who argue soundly and think freely arguments base on the utility or convenience of the belief in god be beside the point they may indeed prove the usefulness of the belief but not the existence of the thing the rigorous eye of philosopher can see that truth and convenience be very different things whatever legislators or statesmen may think so that win seem bias also propose two limitations on arguments that can use on my side win argue from anything that may seem irregular or unaccountable in the work of nature to the conclusion that nature be not cause by infinite power and wisdom already know how you would answer such an argument if do use it namely by say that no one can judge the symmetry and use of the part of an infinite machine whose appropriateness and usefulness depend on how they relate to each other and to the whole without have grasp of the entire machine the whole universe undertake not to argue from premise about the harm that good men suffer and the prosperity that wicked men often enjoy in this life if do argue in that way know how you would reply instead of admit this as good argument against the existence of god you would make it an argument for an after life in which reward and punishments will be distribute in ways that vindicate the divine attribute and set everything right at the end by not use those arguments deprive you of an opportunity to give those answer but there be no unfairness in that even if the answer be good ones they aren arguments for the existence of god all they do be to solve certain difficulties that might be bring against the existence of god on the assumption that it have already be prove by proper arguments think should specify all this so as to save us all time and trouble what we should be aim at here be the discovery and defence of truth and truth may be justify not only by persuade its adversaries but also if they can be persuade by show them to be unreasonable so an argument that shed light will have its effect even against an opponent who shut his eye because it will show him to be obstinate and prejudice anyway minute philosophers be less attentive than anyone to this distinction between arguments that puzzle and arguments that convince so the distinction needn be respect by others in their favour but euphranor may be will to encounter you on your own term in which case have nothing more to say alciphron act like skillful general who work to get the advantage of the grind and entice the enemy to come out of their trench we who believe in god be entrench in tradition custom authority and law but alciphron do not try to dislodge us instead he propose that we should voluntarily abandon these entrenchments and attack him when we could easily and securely act on the defensive leave him the trouble to dispossess us of what we need not resign the reason that you have muster up in your early morning meditation he continue address alciphron if they don weaken our belief in god must help to strengthen it for the utmost be to be expect from such great master in his profession when he really get to work on something regard the confuse notion of deity or supreme invisible power to be the most unconquerable of all prejudice when half dozen able men get together over glass of wine in well light room we easily banish all the spectres of imagination or upbringing and be very clear about what we think and why but as be take solitary walk before it be broad daylight this morning the issue seem not quite so clear and couldn bring to mind the force of the arguments that have usually appear so conclusive at other time experience strange kind of awe and seem haunt by sort of panic which can account for except by suppose it to be the effect of prejudice you see like the rest of the world be once long time ago drill and tutor into the belief in god there be no surer mark of prejudice than believe something without any reason so what need be there for me to set myself the difficult task of prove negative when it be sufficient for me to point out that there be no proof of the affirmative and that accept it without proof be unreasonable so go ahead and prove your opinion if you can you may indeed continue to have it but what you have will be merely prejudice alciphron if we be to content you we must prove it seem and we must do it on your term well for start let us see what sort of proof you expect the sort of proof demand not say expect it be the sort that every intelligent man require for any matter of fact or for the existence of any particular thing other than himself why do believe there be king of great britain because have see him or king of spain because have see people who saw him but as for this king of kings haven see him myself nor have see anyone else who have see him if there be such thing as god surely it very strange that he have leave himself without witness that men should still be argue about his existence and that there should be not single evident sensible plain proof of his existence without have to bring in philosophy or metaphysics matter of fact have to be prove not by notions but by facts you see what be up to these be the principles on the basis of which defy superstition so you believe as far as you can see that be my rule of faith what you win believe in the existence of things that you hear unless you also see them no that wrong when insist on see mean to be talk about perceive in general outward object make very different impressions on the animal spirit impressions that be lump together under the common label sense and whatever we can perceive by any sense we may be sure of widely accept theory go back at least as far as descartes hold that the work of animal body involve animal spirit envisage as extremely fine and fluid matter that can get through hole that be too small to let even air pass through so you believe that there be such things as animal spirit doubtless what sense do you perceive them by don perceive them immediately by any of my sense but be convince of their existence because can infer it from their effect and operations they be the messengers which run to and fro in the nerve enable outward object to affect the soul so you admit the existence of soul provide don admit an immaterial substance see no drawback to allow that there may be such thing as soul it may be no more than thin fine texture of super fine part or spirit reside in the brain not ask about its nature only ask whether you accept that there be source of think and action and whether it be perceivable by sense grant that there be such source and that it isn itself an object of sense but we infer it from appearances that be perceive by sense see note on page if understand you rightly from animal function and motion you infer the existence of animal spirit and from reasonable act you infer the existence of reasonable soul ii so it seem that the existence of things that can be perceive through the sense can be infer from sensible effect and sign iii the soul be what make the principal distinction between real person and shadow between live man and carcass iv so can know that you for instance be distinct think individual live real man except by infer from certain sign that you have soul all act that be immediately and properly perceive by sense come down to motion vi so from motion you infer mover or cause and from reasonable motion or such as appear calculate for reasonable end you infer rational cause soul or spirit vii now the soul of man drive only small body an insignificant particle by comparison with the great mass of nature the elements the heavenly body the system of the world and the wisdom that appear in the motion that be the effect of human reason be incomparably less than the wisdom that reveal itself in the structure and use of organize natural body animal or plant man can make with his hand machine as admirable as the hand itself and none of the motion by which we trace out human reason come anywhere near to the skill and ingenuity of the wonderful motion of the heart brain and other vital part that don depend on the will of man viii so it follow that from natural motion that be independent of man will we can infer both power and wisdom incomparably greater than that of the human soul ix furthermore in natural productions and effect there be visible unity of plan and design the rule of nature be fix and immovable the same laws of motion apply throughout the same in china and here the same two thousand years ago and today and from the mutual respect influence subordinations and use involve in the way animals relate to plant animals and plant relate to the elements and elements relate to heavenly body we can infer that they be all part of one whole all work towards the same end and fulfil the same design suppose all this to be true win it then follow that this vastly great perhaps infinite power and wisdom must be suppose to be in one single agent spirit or mind and that our certainty of the existence of this infinitely wise and powerful spirit be at least as clear full and immediate as our certainty of the existence of any one human soul apart from our own let me think suspect we proceed too hastily remember that in the original version alciphron give consecutive series of nine positive answer it be it may grant it be and so on what do you claim that you can have the same assurance of the existence of god that you can have of my existence when you actually see me stand in front of you and talk to you the very same assurance if not greater how do you support that the phrase the person alciphron mean an individual think thing not the hair skin or visible surface or any part of the outward form colour or shape of alciphron this grant in grant that you grant that strictly speak don see alciphron that individual think thing but only visible sign and tokens that suggest and imply the existence of that invisible source of think or soul in exactly the same way it seem to me that though can with my physical eye see the invisible god do in the strictest sense see and perceive by all my sense the sign and tokens effect and operations that suggest and indicate and demonstrate the existence of an invisible god do this as certainly and make it at least as evident as any sign suggest to me the existence of your soul spirit or think principle be convince that your soul exist by few sign or effect and the movements of one small organic body whereas be always and everywhere perceive sensible sign that point to the existence of god so the thesis that you doubt or deny at the outset now seem obviously to follow from the premise throughout this whole inquiry haven we carefully think about every step we take not move to accept any proposition that wasn clearly evident you and examine and assent to each forego proposition one by one so what should we do with the conclusion speak for myself if you don come to my rescue shall absolutely have to accept the conclusion as true so if live and die as believer in god you ll have to take the blame have to admit that don readily find an answer there seem to be some foundation for what you say but if this matter be as clear as you claim it be can not conceive how so many able men of our sect of free thinkers should be so much in the dark that they don know or believe one syllable of it alciphron it not our present business to explain the oversights or vindicate the honour of those great men the free thinkers when their very existence be in danger of be call in question how so remember your concessions and then show me if the arguments for god be not conclusive what better argument you have to prove the existence of the think thing which in strictness constitute the free thinker alciphron stop in his track and stand in posture of meditation while the rest of us continue our walk after little while he re join us with smile face like someone who have make some discovery have find he say something that may clear up the point in dispute and completely answer euphranor challenge mean an argument that will prove the existence of free thinker but can be adapt to prove the existence of god this idea of yours that we perceive the existence of god as certainly and immediately as we do that of human person be more than could swallow though have to admit that it puzzle me until have think it through at first think that particular structure shape or motion might be the most certain proof of think reasonable soul but little attention satisfy me that these things have no necessary connection with reason knowledge and wisdom perhaps they be certain proof of live soul but they can be certain proof of think and reasonable one on second thoughts and after minute examination of this point have find that nothing so much convince me of the existence of another person as his speak to me it hear you talk that be the best strict and philosophical argument have for your existence and this be restrict argument that can be adapt to your purpose for you win claim that god speak to man in the same clear and audible way as one man speak to another will you what be the impression of sound so much more evident than that of other sense and if it be be the voice of man louder than that of thunder you be miss the point what talk about be not the sheer sound of speech but language we have perceptible sign that don resemble and aren necessarily connect with the things they signify the way we use them be arbitrary in the sense of be choose by us rather than lay down in the nature of things and what we use them for be to suggest and exhibit to the mind of others an endless variety of things that differ in nature time and place thereby give one another information entertainment and direction for how to act with regard to near and present things and also distant and future things whether these sign be pronounce and hear or write and see they have the same use and be equally proof of an intelligent think design cause but what if it should appear that god really speak to man would this content you don accept stories about inward speech holy instincts or indications of light or spirit men of good sense regard all that as nothing to achieve something on this topic you ll need to make it plain to me that god speak to men by outward perceptible sign of the same kind and in the same way as have define well if show it to be plainly the case that god speak to men through arbitrary outward perceptible sign that don resemble and aren necessarily connect with the things they stand for and suggest and that by countless combinations of these sign an endless variety of things be reveal and make know to us and that through this we be instruct or inform about the different natures of things be teach and warn about what to avoid and what to pursue and be tell how to regulate our movements and how to act with respect to things that be far off in space or in the future will this satisfy you it just the thing challenge you to prove for it incorporate the force and use and nature of language see note on page look alciphron you can see castle on that hill over there ii it be long way away iii thing distance from oneself be line turn endwise to the eye iv and line in that situation can project more than one single point on the bottom of the eye so the appearance of long distance have the same size as the appearance of short one or rather neither of them have any size at all because always what you have at the eye be single point vi it follow from this that distance be not immediately perceive by the eye vii so it must be perceive by the mediation of some other thing viii to discover what this mediator this intermediate item be let us examine how the appearance of an object change as it be place at different distance from the eye find by experience that as an object be move further and further away from me its visible appearance become lesser and fainter and this change of appearance seem to be what we go by in take in differences of distance ix but littleness or faintness don seem in themselves to be necessarily connect with greater distance so it only because of our experience that littleness and faintness suggest or be sign of distance that be to say we don perceive distance immediately we perceive it through the mediation of sign that doesn resemble it and isn necessarily connect with it but only suggest it on the basis of repeat experience as word suggest things wait bite euphranor ve just remember that writers on optics tell us of an angle that the two optic ax make where they meet at the object be look at the more obtuse this angle be the nearer it show the object to be and the more acute the angle the further away the object be and this hold not as something arbitrary that we learn by experience but as necessary connection that can be demonstrate so the mind discover how far away things be by geometry it do wouldn it follow then that the only people who could see be those who have learn geometry and know something of line and angle there sort of natural geometry that be acquire without learn but alciphron in order to construct proof of any kind or deduce conclusion from premise don have to perceive how the term be connect with one another in the premise and how the premise be connect with the conclusion more generally if be to know one thing by mean of another thing don first have to know when perceive your mean by your word don have first to perceive the word themselves and in any inference don have to know the premise before infer the conclusion all this be true thus whoever infer nearer distance from wider angle or further distance from an acuter angle must first perceive the angle themselves someone who doesn perceive those angle can infer anything from them can he it be as you say now ask the first man you meet whether he perceive or know anything of those optic angle or whether he ever think about them or infer anything from them whether by natural or by artificial geometry how would you expect him to answer candidly think he would answer that he know nothing of those matter so it can be true that men judge distance by angle and that remove all the force from your argument to prove that distance be perceive by mean of something that have necessary connection with it agree with you it seem to me that man can know whether or not he perceive thing and if he do perceive it he can know whether he do this immediately or mediately and if he perceive it mediately he can know whether he be do this by mean of something like or unlike the thing necessarily or arbitrarily connect with it it seem so and isn it certain that if distance be not perceive immediately just by itself or by mean of any image that resemble it or by mean of any line and angle that have necessary connection with it it be perceive only by mean of experience it be from the things have say and you have agree to doesn it seem to follow that before man have any experience he wouldn imagine that the things he saw be at any distance from him what show me the smallness or faintness of appearance or any other idea or sensation that doesn resemble distance and isn necessarily connect with it can suggest differences of distance can suggest anything about distance to mind that hasn experience connection between those things and distance any more than word can suggest notions to man before he have learn the language agree that that true then doesn it follow that man who be bear blind and be then enable to see would when he first gain his sight take the things he saw to be not at any distance from him but rather in his eye or in his mind have to admit that this seem right and yet find it hard to believe that if be in such state would think that the object now see at such great distance be at no distance at all so you do now think that the object of sight be at distance from you certainly do can anyone question that that castle over there be at great distance tell me alciphron can you pick out the doors windows and battlements of that same castle can at this distance it seem only small round tower but have visit the castle and know that it not small round tower but large square build with battlements and turrets that you evidently don see what do you infer from that infer that the object that you strictly and properly perceive by sight be not the very same thing as the one that be several miles distant why so because little round object be one thing and great square object be another isn that right can deny it tell me isn the proper object of sight the thing that we actually strictly immediately see the visible appearance it be what do you now think about the visible appearance of the moon up there isn it round shin flat thing no bigger than sixpence what if it be well tell me what you think about the moon itself don you think of it as vast opaque globe with many hill and valleys do then how can you think that the proper object of your sight exist at distance admit that don know to convince you even more consider that crimson cloud in the east do you think that if you be in it you would perceive anything like what you now see by no mean all would see be dark mist isn it clear then that the castle the moon and the cloud that you see here be not the real castle moon and cloud that you suppose exist at distance what be to think then do we see anything at all or be the visual side of our live nothing but fancy and illusion here be the bottom line as understand it the proper object of sight be light and colour with their many hue and degrees of saturation and of brightness these can be vary and put together in countless different ways form language that be wonderfully adapt to indicate and exhibit to us the distance shape locations size and various qualities of tangible object ones we can perceive through our sense of touch the object of sight don resemble the tangible things nor be they necessarily connect with them the association of sight with touch be due to god choose it it like the association between word and the things signify by them what don we strictly speak perceive by sight such things as tree house men rivers and so on we do indeed perceive or apprehend those things by the faculty of sight but it doesn follow from this they be the proper and immediate object of sight any more than that all the things that be signify by the help of speak word or sound be the proper and immediate object of hear so you want us to think that light shade and colour variously combine correspond to the many articulations of sound in language and that by mean of them all sort of object be suggest to the mind through the eye in the same way that they be suggest by word or sound through the ear not through logical inference by the faculty of judgment and not through similarities that be pick up by the imagination but purely and solely from experience custom and habit don want you to think anything more than the nature of things oblige you to think don want you to submit in the least to my judgment but only to the force of truth and doubt if even the freest thinkers will claim to be exempt from that constraint you have lead me step by step to place where be lose but ll try to get out again if not by the way come then by some other that find for myself short pause then tell me euphranor wouldn it follow from these principles that man who have be bear blind and be then enable to see would at first sight not only not perceive how far away men and tree etc be from him but also not perceive that they be men and tree surely this be absurd agree that the principles we have both accept do imply that such man would never think of men tree or any other object that he have be accustom to perceive only by touch at the stage of his development that we be talk about his mind would be fill with new sensations of light and colour whose various combinations he wouldn yet understand or know the mean of any more than chinese person on first hear the word man and tree would think of men and tree in each case there have to be time and experience in which repeat events would enable him to acquire habit of know how the sign be connect with the things that be signify to enable him to understand the language whether the language of the eye or the language of the ears see nothing absurd in all this the phrase the language of the eye refer not to human language as write down but to god language in which the visual appearances of things inform us about their distance and their tactual qualities in strict philosophical truth therefore see that rock only in the sense in which hear that rock when hear the word rock be utter in the very same sense then why be it that everyone will say that he see rock or house when those things be before his eye whereas nobody will say that he hear rock or house when he hear and understand the word rock or house and second point if vision be only language speak to the eye when do men learn this language it pretty difficult task to learn the mean of all the sign that make up language but no one will say that he have devote time and trouble to learn this language of vision that not surprise if we have be all practise this language ever since our first entrance into the world if god constantly speak to the eye of all mankind even in their earliest infancy whenever their eye be open in the light it doesn seem to me at all strange that men aren aware they ever learn language that they begin on so early and practise so constantly as this language of vision remember also that it be the same language throughout the whole world and not differ in different place as other languages do so we can understand how men might mistake the connection between the proper object of sight and the things they signify for some kind of similarity or necessary relation and even how they might take them to be the same things euphranor then point out that our conscious mind tend overlook things that we be in fact steer by when they be extremely familiar for example you ve be read this page without consciously attend to the individual letter of which the word be make up alciphron grumble that euphranor point be too dry and tedious for gentleman attention crito snap back at him alciphron reply try to lower the temperature and then to cut short this squabble resume the discussion put it fairly to your own conscience do you really think that god himself speak every day and in every place to the eye of all men that be really and truly what think and you should think it too if you be consistent with yourself and stand by your own definition of language you can deny that the great mover and author of nature constantly explain himself to the eye of men by mean of perceptible arbitrary sign that have no resemblance or necessary connection with the things signify so that by compound and arrange them to suggest and exhibit an endless variety of object of different kinds in different time and place thereby inform and direct men how to act with respect to distant and future things as well as near and present ones the compound and arrange part of this be offer as analogous to construct sentence out of word there will soon be good deal more about this these be your view as well as mine and their consequence be that you have as much reason to think god speak to your eye as you can have for think that any give person speak to your ears can help think that some fallacy run throughout this whole line of argument though can easily put finger on it it seem to me that every other sense have as good claim as vision to be call language smell and taste for example be sign that inform us of other qualities to which they have neither resemblance nor necessary connection certainly they be sign there be general concept of sign that cover the part of language as well as all those other sign but equally certainly not all sign be language not even all significant sound such as the natural cry of animals or the inarticulate sound and interjections of men the true nature of language consist in the articulation combination variety copiousness extensive and general use and easy application of sign and all of these be commonly find in vision as well as in languages more conventionally so call other sense may indeed provide sign but those sign have no more right to be think to be language than inarticulate sound such as pain grunt or surprise whistle wait let me see in language the sign be arbitrary aren they they be and consequently they don always suggest real matter of fact because people sometimes say things that be false whereas this natural language of vision as you call it or these visible sign do always suggest things in the same uniform way and have the same constant regular connection with matter of fact which seem to imply that their connection with what they signify be necessary which would mean they weren language after all accord to the definition of language that we have be work with how do you solve this objection you can solve it yourself with the help of picture or mirror you re right see there be nothing in it when look at certain picture receive visual statement that there yellow tiger on that wall and there isn when look in mirror receive visual statement that there beard old man star at me and there isn this simple point really do counter alciphron view that visual statements be necessarily connect with tangible realities don know what else to say about this view of yours other than that it so odd and contrary to my way of think that ll never assent to it remember please your own lecture about prejudice and apply them in the present case maybe they will help you to follow where reason lead and to be suspicious of notions that be strongly rivet without ever have be examine indignantly reject the suspicion of prejudice not speak only for myself know club of extremely able men the freest from prejudice of any men alive who hate the notion of god and sure would be very able to untie this knot dion our narrator speak up here remark that alciphron reliance on others be unworthy of him and of his principles as well as be dangerous tactic crito then weigh in with scornful colourful offensive remark about how free thinkers insincerely vary their standards of intellectual conduct accord to what company they be in nasty quarrel be in the make but alciphron call halt to this irksome and needle discourse he continue for my part be friend to inquiry be will that reason should have its full and free scope build on no man authority for my part deny god doesn serve my self interest in any way any man may believe or not believe god as he please still euphranor must allow me to stare little at his conclusions the conclusions be yours as much as mine for you be lead to them by your own concessions you it seem stare to find that god be not far from every one of us and that in him we live and move and have our be act first thing this morning you think it strange that god should leave himself without witness do you now think it strange that the witness should be so full and clear must say do be aware of certain metaphysical hypothesis to the effect that we see all things in god by the union of the human soul with the intelligible substance of the deity which neither nor anyone else could make sense of this refer to thesis of malebranche for sober hard think out reason he hold that any ideas that come before our mind be literally god not ideas that he cause in us but ideas that he have himself in his mind the phrase intelligible substance of the deity be typical malebranche speak but never dream that anyone would claim that we see god with our own physical eye as plainly as we see any human person whatsoever and that he daily speak to our sense in plain and clear dialect as for that metaphysical hypothesis can make no more of it than you can but think it clear that this optical language that euphranor have be describe have necessary connection with knowledge wisdom and goodness it be equivalent to constant creation indicate an immediate act of power and providence it can be account for on mechanical principles by atoms or attractions or emanations of gas here what we have the instantaneous production and reproduction of ever so many sign combine dissolve transpose diversify and adapt to an endless variety of purpose constantly shift in ways that be suitable to the circumstances incapable of be explain by the laws of motion chance fate or any other such blind source of energy this present and testify to the immediate operation of spirit or think be wise good and provident spirit who direct and rule and govern the world some philosophers be convince of the wisdom and power of the creator from the structure and work of organic body and the orderly system of the world nevertheless think that god leave this system with all its part and content well adjust and set in motion as an artisan leave clock to run on its own for certain period but this visual language prove that there be not merely creator but care governor who be actually and intimately present to us attentive to all our interest and to all our movements watch our conduct and attend to our minutest action and design throughout the whole course of our live inform scold and direct us incessantly in most evident and perceptible manner this be truly wonderful and isn it amaze that men should be surround by such wonder without reflect on it there something divine and admirable in this language address to our eye something that may well awaken the mind and deserve its utmost attention it be learn with so little trouble it express the differences of things so clearly and aptly it instruct so quickly and clearly convey by one glance greater variety of bits of advice and clearer knowledge of things than could be have from several hours of talk and along with inform it also amuse and entertain the mind with such unique pleasure and delight it be of excellent use in give stability and permanence to human discourse in record sound and bestow life on dead languages enable us to write and read and thus to converse with men of remote age and countries and it answer so precisely to our purpose and need inform us more clearly about object whose nearness and size make them likely to do the most harm or good to our body and less exactly in proportion as their smallness or distance from us make them of less concern to us and yet men aren much impress by these strange things but they aren strange they re familiar and that why they be overlook things that rarely happen make an impression when they do whereas frequency lessen our admiration for things that may in themselves be ever so admirable so an ordinary person who isn much give to think and meditate would probably be more convince of the existence of god by one single sentence hear once in his life come down from the sky than by all the experience he have have of this visual language contrive with such exquisite skill so constantly address to his eye and so plainly declare the nearness wisdom and providence of the person who be address us but still can help wonder how men should be so little surprise or amaze by this visual faculty if it really be of such surprise and amaze nature let suppose nation of men blind from birth among whom stranger arrive the only sight man in all the country let suppose that this stranger travel with some of the natives and that he foretell that if they walk straight forward in half an hour they ll meet men or cattle or come to house that if they make right turn and then keep walk they will in few minutes be in danger of fall down precipice that by walk to the leave they will in such and such time arrive at river wood or mountain what do you think wouldn they be infinitely surprise that someone who have never be in their country before know it so much better than themselves and wouldn those predictions seem to them as inexplicable and incredible as prophecy would to minute philosopher can deny it but it seem to require intense think to be able to sort out prejudice that have be so long form to get over the vulgar error of think there be ideas that be common to both sense and thus to be able to distinguish the object of sight from those of touch these two kinds of object have if may put it this way blend together so intimately in our imagination that it extremely difficult for us to think ourselves into the precise state one of those men would be in if he be enable to see but believe it can be do and it might seem worth the trouble of little think especially to men who be specially and intensively engage in think unravel prejudice and expose mistake admit frankly that can find my way out of this maze can think myself into the frame of mind of the bear blind man who just begin to see and would be glad to be guide out of it by those who see better than do crito quote biblical passage he be remind of then servant announce that tea be ready they go inside for it and find lysicles already there be glad to have find my second say alciphron fresh man to maintain our common cause which sure lysicles will think have suffer through his absence why so have be draw into some concessions you win like let me know what they be well that there be such thing as god and that his existence be very certain bless me how do you come to entertain such wild idea well you know we claim to follow reason wherever it lead in brief have be reason into it reason you should say baffle with word bewilder by sophistry would you like to hear the reason that lead alciphron and me step by step so that we can examine whether or not it be sophistry easy about that can guess everything that can be say on that topic it will be my business to help my friend out whatever arguments draw him in will you admit the premise and deny the conclusions what if admit the conclusion what will you grant that there be god perhaps may then we be agree perhaps not lysicles you be subtle adversary don know what you be up to well the existence of god be basically an affair of little importance and man may make this concession without yield much what really matter be what sense the word god be to be give even the epicureans allow that there be gods but then they be idle gods with no concern about human affairs hobbes allow corporeal god and spinoza hold that the universe be god yet nobody doubt that these men be staunch free thinkers could wish indeed that the word god be entirely drop because in most mind it be couple with sort of superstitious awe the very root of all religion still don much mind if the name god be retain and the existence of god accept in any sense except that of mind that know everything and survey human action like some judge or magistrate with infinite care and intelligence the belief in god in this sense fill man mind with worry put him under constraints and embitter his very be but the belief in god in another sense can be free of anything much in the way of bad consequences know this be the opinion of our great diagoras who tell me he would never have take the trouble to discover demonstration that there be no god if the generally accept notion of god have be the one that some of the church father and scholastics have and what be that well diagoras have discover that once upon time the deepest and most theoretically serious theologians find that they couldn reconcile the attribute of god when take in the ordinary sense or in any know sense with human reason and how the world show itself to be so they adopt the doctrine that the word knowledge wisdom goodness and so on when apply to god must be understand in quite different sense from what they mean in ordinary language and from anything that we can form notion of or conceive this let them easily answer any objections that might be make against the attribute of god all they have to do be to deny that those attribute belong to god in this or that or any know particular sense which amount to deny that they belong to him at all and by deny the attribute of god they in effect deny his existence though they may not have be aware of that here an example suppose man be to object that future contingencies be inconsistent with god foreknowledge because certain knowledge of something that be uncertain be self contradictory the theologians be talk about have an easy answer to ready at hand namely what you say may be true with respect to knowledge take in the ordinary sense or in any sense that we can possibly form any notion of but there no inconsistency between the contingent nature of things and divine foreknowledge take to signify something of which we know nothing something that serve god in the way that what we understand by knowledge serve us the difference between these two be not one of quantity or degree of perfection they differ altogether totally in kind as light differ from sound actually they differ even more than that because light and sound be both sensations whereas knowledge in god have no sort of resemblance or agreement with any notion that man can form of knowledge the same can be say of all the other attribute which in this way can be equally reconcile with everything or with nothing any think person must see this be cut knot rather than untie them for something can be reconcile with the divine attribute when these attribute themselves be deny of god in every intelligible sense so that the very notion of god be take away and nothing be leave but the name without any mean attach to it in short the belief that there be an unknown subject of attribute that be absolutely unknown be very innocent doctrine which be why the acute diagoras who saw this be perfectly delight with this system if this could once make its way and be accept in the world diagoras say that would put an end to all natural or rational religion which be the basis of both the jewish and the christian religions for someone who come to god or go into the church of god must first believe that there be god in some intelligible sense not merely that there be something in general without any proper notion even very inadequate one of any of its qualities or attribute for this something in general could be fate or chaos or creative nature or anything else as well as it could be god and it no help to say there be something in this unknown be that be analogous to knowledge and goodness something that produce the effect that we can conceive to be produce by men without knowledge and goodness for this be still to surrender to the atheist side against the theists the dispute have never be over whether there be principle roughly something absolutely basic or primal first cause because all philosophers right back to the pre socratics have agree that there be what they haven agree about be whether these be true or false this principle be think intelligent be the order beauty and usefulness that we see in natural effect couldn be produce by anything but mind or intelligence properly so call the first cause must have have true real proper knowledge so we on the atheist side who think that all three be false will accept that all the natural effect that be vulgarly ascribe to knowledge and wisdom come from be in which there be no knowledge or wisdom properly so call at all but only something else that cause the things that men in their ignorance ascribe to what they call knowledge and wisdom and understand you may be surprise to hear man of pleasure like me philosophize in this context but there lot to be gain from conversation with able men it short cut to knowledge and save one from the drudgery of read and think so now we have grant to you that there be god in this indefinite sense what use can you make of this concession you can argue from unknown attribute you can prove that god should be love for his goodness fear for his justice or respect for his knowledge we agree that all those consequences would follow from god have goodness and the rest with those name take in intelligible sense but we deny that any consequences follow from attribute admit in no particular sense or in sense that none of us understand thus since from such an account of god nothing can be infer about conscience or worship or religion you be welcome to the account and so as not to stand out from the crowd we ll use the name god too and so snap there an end of atheism this account of deity be new to me don like it so ll leave it to be maintain by those who do it not new to me while ago hear minute philosopher triumph on this very point and that set me to inquire what basis there be for it in the church father or the scholastics crito now embark on long and learn lecture start with the early history of this idea that knowledge etc be not to be apply to god in the same sense as they be to men just how early its start be be not clear because issue arise about the true authorship of various work it be clear that the thesis wasn mean in the flatten out way in which lysicles have understand it but rather than go into all those detail we can safely jump ahead to this thomas aquinas express his sense of this matter as follow all perfections that create things get from god be also perfections of god in certain higher sense which the scholastics express by say that those perfections be in god eminently so whenever we attribute to god perfection to which we give name borrow from that perfection in create things we must exclude from the name mean everything that belong to the imperfect way in which that attribute be find in create things from this he infer that knowledge in god be not habit or disposition but pure act and although suarez join other scholastics in teach that the mind of man conceive knowledge and will to be faculties or operations of god only by analogy to create things yet he plainly declare this not quotation from him when it be say that knowledge be not properly in god this must be understand to be refer to knowledge include imperfection conceptual knowledge or some other imperfect kind of knowledge that create be have none of those imperfections in the knowledge of men or angels be feature of knowledge as such there can be knowledge that doesn have them so from the premise that god doesn have such imperfection include knowledge it doesn follow that knowledge in the proper sense of knowledge can be attribute to god and of knowledge take in general way for the clear evident understand of all truth he expressly affirm that this be in god and that this be never deny by any philosopher who believe in god at that time the scholastics generally hold that even be should be attribute to god and to create things only analogically that be they hold that god the supreme independent self cause cause and source of all be mustn be suppose to exist in the same sense of exist as that in which create be exist not that he exist less truly or properly than they do but only that he exist in more eminent and perfect manner wouldn want anyone to be lead through misunderstand of scholastics use of the term analogy and analogical to the view that we can get any distance towards form true and proper notion of attribute that we apply to god by analogy so let us look into the true sense and mean of those word everyone know that analogy be greek word use by mathematicians to signify liken of proportion for example when we observe that two be to six as three be to nine this equality of proportion be call analogy and although the word proportion strictly signify only the relation of one quantity to another in looser derive sense it have be apply to signify every other kind of relational property and the term analogy have be broaden along with proportion so that now it signify liken or equality in respect of all relations or relational properties whatsoever and so we find the scholastics tell us there be an analogy between intellect and sight because intellect be to the mind what sight be to the body and that he who govern the state be analogous to him who steer ship so that monarch be analogically call pilot be to the state what pilot be to his vessel there something else that may help to clear this matter up namely the scholastics distinction between two kinds of analogy metaphorical and proper the bible have plenty of examples of metaphorical analogy attribute human part and passions to god when he be represent as have finger an eye or an ear when he be say to repent to be angry or grieve everyone see that the analogy be merely metaphorical such things as part and passions properly understand essentially involve some imperfection so when it be say the finger of god appear in some event men of common sense mean only that the event in question be as truly ascribe to god as the work work by human finger be ascribe to man and similarly with the rest the phrase the rest be berkeley if it be mean to cover anger and grief as well as eye and ears crito doesn explain how but the case be different when wisdom and knowledge be attribute to god passions and sense as such involve defect but there no defect in knowledge as such so it be all right to attribute knowledge to god therefore in the proper formal mean of the word knowledge as long as it be attribute in way that be proportional to god infinite nature so we can say that just as god be infinitely above man so his knowledge be infinitely above man thus this doctrine of analogical perfections in god or our know god by analogy seem to be misunderstand by those who infer from it that we can form any direct or proper notion however inadequate of knowledge or wisdom as these occur in god and now gentlemen you may think should ask your pardon for have dwell so long it twice as long in the original on point of metaphysics and introduce into good company such unpolished and unfashionable writers as the scholastics but lysicles give me the open so leave him to answer for it never dream of this dry lecture if have open up the discussion to these scholarly matter by my unfortunate mention of the scholastics it be my first fault of that kind and promise it will be my last don enjoy involvement with crab author of any sort it true that occasionally one find good idea in what we call dry writers an example be the idea be speak of which must admit strike my fancy but for writers such as these we have the like of prodicus and diagoras who read obsolete book and save the rest of us that trouble so you pin your faith on them only for some odd opinions and matter of fact and critical point but could safely rely on them for more than that we know the men in whom we put our trust they be judicious and honest and have no aim except to get to the truth and sure that some author or other have maintain the view present in the same sense as diagoras report it that may be but it never be generally accept view and it never will be so long as men believe in god that be because the same arguments that there be first cause also prove that the first cause be intelligent use intelligent in its proper sense and also wise and good use those word too in their true and formal mean but for your part alciphron you have be fully convince that god be think intelligent be in the same sense as other spirit though not in the same imperfect manner or degree well do have some worry about that with knowledge you infer perhaps imply wisdom and with wisdom you infer goodness and can see that it be either wise or good to enact laws that can ever be obey do anyone find fault with the exactness of geometrical rule because no one in practice can achieve it the perfection of rule be useful even if it isn reach many can approach something that no one actually reach but how be it possible to conceive of god as so good when man be so wicked there be some plausibility perhaps to the idea that little soft shadow of evil set off the bright and luminous part of the creation and so contribute to the beauty of the whole piece here paint but you can account in that way for such large black blot as those the world have that there should be so much vice and so little virtue on earth and that the laws of god kingdom should be so poorly observe by his subject that what can be reconcile with the surpass wisdom and goodness of the supreme monarch tell me alciphron would you argue that state be ill administer or judge the manners of its citizens on the evidence of the disorder commit in the gaol or dungeon would not well for all we know this spot with its few sinners may be as small proportion of the universe of think be as dungeon be of kingdom we seem to get our view not only from revelation but also from ordinary plain sense perception which lead us to infer by analogy with the world as we see it that there be innumerable order of intelligent be happier and more perfect than man our life be very short and this earthly globe where we live be mere point in comparison with the whole system of god creation we be indeed dazzle by the glory and grandeur of some things here below because we know no better but incline to believe that if we know what it be to be an angel for one hour we would return to this world even to sit on the brightest throne in it with vastly more loathe and reluctance than we would now descend into loathsome dungeon or sepulchre to me it seem natural that such weak passionate and short sight creature as man be always liable to worry of one kind or other but as he this very same creature be also apt to be over positive in judge and over hasty in draw conclusions these difficulties and doubt about god conduct be turn into objections to his existence and so men end up argue from their own defect against the divine perfections and although the view and temperaments of men be different and often opposite you can sometimes see them deduce the same atheistic conclusion from contrary premise two minute philosophers whom know use to argue each from his own temperament against providence care god one of them bad temper and vindictive man say that he couldn believe in providence because london have not be swallow up or consume by fire from heaven the reason he give be that the streets be full of people who show no belief in god or worship of him except perpetually pray that he would damn rot sink and confound them that sentence from perpetually to the end be as berkeley write it the original like this version seem to speak of people call down god wrath on themselves the other an idle good temper fellow conclude that there can be such thing as providence because an utterly wise be would have to have better things to do than attend to the prayers and action and little interest of mankind after all if god have no passions how can it be true that vengeance be his or how can he be say to be jealous of his glory for the lord thy god be jealous god exodus in this context jealous of his glory mean resentful of anything that deny or belittle his glory we believe that god execute vengeance without revenge and be jealous without weakness just as the mind of man see without eye and grasp without hand as when we say see the flaw in your argument and grasp the situation it time to end this part of the discussion so we ll grant that there be god in this dispassionate sense but then what of it what do this have to do with religion or divine worship what be the point of all these prayers and praise and thanksgivings and psalm sing that the foolish vulgar call serve god what sense be there in all these things what use be they what be they for we worship god we praise and pray to him not because we think that he be proud of our worship or fond of our praise or prayers and affect by them as mankind be or because we think that our service can contribute in some measure to his happiness or good but because it be good for us to be dispose to relate in that way to god because our worship be just and right suitable to the nature of things and fit to the way we relate to our supreme lord and governor if it be good for us to worship god it would seem that the christian religion which claim to teach men the knowledge and worship of god be of some use and benefit to mankind doubtless unless be very much mistake you win be able to show that that be right it be now nearly dinner time let stop our conversation for now and pick it up again tomorrow morning fifth dialogue saturday dion report that on the next morning friday the group walk to charm spot in the countryside and be settle down for an all day conversation when they be interrupt by clamour include the bark of hound and the roar of country squire it be fox hunt in which one of the hunters have fall from his horse and break rib the day be spend in get him to crito home and care for him there send for surgeon feed the fox hunters who with loud rustic mirth give proof of their religion and loyalty by the healths they drink and so on the follow morning the discussion group return to the place where they have be when the hunt and accident interrupt them now lysicles be fastidiously elegant man and witty one be utterly contemptuous of the rough manners and conversation of the fox hunters and be angry that he have lose so many hours in their company cheer myself up he say by the think that there be no longer any of this species among us mean presumably move in the social circle in which move it strange that men should be entertain by such uncouth noise and hurry or find pleasure in the society of dog and horse how much more elegant the diversions of the town be fox hunters reply euphranor in certain way resemble free thinkers the fox hunters employ their animal faculties in pursuit of game and you gentlemen employ your intellectual faculties in the pursuit of truth it the same sort of pastime though the object be different would rather be compare to any brute on earth than rational brute in this context rational be code for human lysicles be say that he would rather be compare to sub human animal than to brutish human be such as fox hunter that mean that you have be less displease with my friend pythocles whom have hear compare the common sort of minute philosophers not to the hunters but to the hound he give this reason you ll often see among the dog loud babbler with bad nose lead the unskilful part of the pack who all rush after him without follow any scent of their own any more than the herd of free thinkers follow their own reason but pythocles be blunt man and he can ever have encounter such reasoners among the free thinkers as you gentlemen who can sit so long at an argument dispute every inch of grind and yet know when to make reasonable concession don know how it happen but it seem that alciphron have be make concessions for me as well as for himself speak for myself not quite so ready to concede things but don want to be stand out either truly alciphron when consider how far we have come and how far we be agree think it likely that we ll eventually come to be in complete agreement you have grant that life of virtue be to be prefer as the kind of life most conducive both to the general good of mankind and to the good of individuals and you allow that the beauty of virtue isn by itself strong enough motive to get mankind to live virtuously this lead you to agree that the belief in god would be very useful in the world and that therefore you would be dispose to accept any reasonable proof of his existence such proof have be give and you have accept it well then if we admit divinity why not divine worship and if worship why not religion to teach this worship and if some religion why not the christian one if we can find better one and christianity be already establish by the laws of our country and hand down to us from our forefathers be we to believe in god yet not pray to him for future benefit or thank him for past ones not trust in his protection or love his goodness or praise his wisdom or marvel at his power and if these things be to be do can we do them in any way that be more suitable to the dignity of god and man than the way lay down by the christian religion be not perhaps altogether sure that religion must be absolutely bad for the public but hate to see religion walk hand in hand with considerations of government and social order don like to see human right tie to religion be not in favour of any kind of govern high priest he reel off list of countries that have have such know witty free thinker he dead now who be great admirer of the ancient druids he detest the present establish religion but use to say that he would like to see the druids and their religion restore as it flourish in gaul and britain in ancient time it would be good thing he think that there should be number of thoughtful men set apart to preserve knowledge of arts and sciences to educate youth and to teach men the immortality of the soul and the moral virtues that be what the ancient druids do he say and be glad to see them once more establish among us how would you like it alciphron that priests should have power to decide all controversies settle dispute about property distribute reward and punishments that anyone who didn submit to their decree should be excommunicate regard with disgust exclude from all honour and privilege and deprive of the common benefit of the laws and that from time to time number of laymen should be cram together in wicker work idol and burn to death as an offer to their pagan gods how would you like live under such priests and such religion not at all such state of affairs would be utterly unacceptable to free thinkers but that what the druids and their religion be like if we can trust cæsar account of them now more than ever convince that there ought to be no such thing as an establish religion of any kind certainly all the nations of the world have until now be out of their wits even the athenians the wisest and freest people on earth have who know what foolish attachment to their establish church they offer it seem monetary reward to whoever would kill diagoras of melos free think contemporary who laugh at their mysteries and protagoras another of the same sort narrowly escape be put to death for write something that seem to contradict their accept notions of the gods that how our noble sect be treat in ancient athens and have no doubt that your druids would have sacrifice many holocaust berkeley word of free thinkers wouldn give farthing to exchange one religion for another away with them all together root and branch anything less than that isn worth do no druids or priests of any sort for me see no place in the world for any of them this remind me of how we end our last philosophical conversation we agree that next time we would return to the point we have then just begin on namely the use or benefit of the christian religion which alciphron challenge crito to show all the readier to take this up because don think it be hard to do one great mark of christianity truth be in my view its tendency to do good it seem to be the north star principal guide to navigation at sea that guide all our judgments about practical matter include moral ones because these be always connect with universal benefit but to think straight about this matter we should try to do what lysicles do in an earlier conversation see page take account of things as whole go as far as we possibly can in see how principles branch out into consequences in its four occurrences in this paragraph principle mean source or seed see euphranor on page we needn pay much attention to the moods or whims or imaginary distress of few idle men whose ideas may be offend though their conscience can be wound what we have to do be to consider fairly the true interest of individuals as well as of human society now as be evident to anyone who get his notion of it from the gospel the christian religion be fountain of light joy and peace source of faith hope and charity so it have to be principle of happiness and virtue you have to be blind not to see that destroy the principles of good action must destroy good action as for someone who see this and yet persist in try to destroy the principles if he isn wicked who be it seem to me that any man who can see in some depth and some breadth must be aware of his own misery sinfulness and dependence perceive that this present world be not design or adapt to make rational souls happy welcome the chance to get into better state and be overjoy to find that the road lead to that better state involve love god and man practise every virtue live reasonably while we be here on earth proportion the value we put on things to the value they actually have and use this world without misuse it that what christianity require it doesn require the cynic nastiness or the numbness of the stoic can there be higher ambition than to overcome the world or wiser ambition than to subdue ourselves or more comfortable doctrine than the forgiveness of sin or more joyful prospect than that of have our low nature renovate and assimilate to the deity our be make fellow citizens with angels and sons of god do pythagoreans or platonists or stoics ever propose to the mind of man purer mean or nobler end how much of our happiness depend on hope how totally be hope extinguish by the minute philosophy on the other hand how it be cherish and raise by the gospel let anyone who think seriously consider these things and then say which he think deserve better of mankind he who recommend christianity or he who run it down which do he think be likelier to lead happy life to be hopeful son an honest dealer worthy patriot he who sincerely believe the gospel or he who doesn believe word of it he who aim at be child of god or he who be content to be know as one of epicurus hog just look at the character and behaviour of average examples of the two sort of men and then say which sort live in way that accord best with the dictate of reason the preparer of this text ask anthony long uc berkeley for help with epicurus hog and this be part of his reply include with permission in the last verse of horace little epistle to tibullus he describe himself to his fellow poet as hog from epicurus herd in his self mock context horace say that he have be observe the epicurean rule of live care free for the day when you want to laugh you will see me sleek and fat in fine shape hog horace know that the true epicurean be not voluptuary but he ironically echo that stock prejudice it amaze to see how different things look when they be view in different light or by different eye the picture have of religion be very unlike yours crito when consider how it unman the soul fill it with absurd dream and slavish fear how it extinguish the gentle passions inspire spirit of malice and rage and persecution when see bitter resentments and unholy wrath in the very men who preach meekness and charity to others perhaps gentlemen of your sect think that religion be subject beneath their attention but it seem to me that someone who set about oppose any doctrine ought to know what he be oppose so ll tell you religion be the virtuous mean between disbelief and superstition we don defend superstitious follies or the rage of bigots what we plead for be religion against irreligion law against confusion virtue against vice the hope of christian against the despondency of an atheist win defend bitter resentments and unholy wrath in any man much less in christian and least of all in clergyman but if even the best christians sometimes produce outbursts of angry emotion that win surprise anyone who reflect on the sarcasms and rudeness with which christians be treat by the minute philosophers for as cicero remark somewhere an insult have sting that wise and good man will find it hard to bear he say it in latin but even if you sometimes see particular self profess christians go to faulty extremes of any kind through passion and weakness while unbelievers of calmer and cooler temperament sometimes behave better this contrast prove nothing in favour of disbelief or against christianity if believer act badly that be because of the man not of his belief and if an unbeliever do good that be because of the man not of his unbelief you win deny that the clergy be regard as physicians of the soul and that religion be sort of medicine that they deal in and administer well now if very many souls be diseased and lose how can we think that their the physician be skillful or that his medicine be good it common complaint that vice increase and men grow more wicked by the day if shepherd flock be diseased or unsound who be to blame but the shepherd for neglect them or not know how to cure them have nothing but contempt for such shepherd such medicine and such physicians who do what all huckster do use grave and elaborate speeches to peddle their pills to the people who be never the better for them it seem utterly reasonable to say that we should base our judgment of physician and his medicine on the medicine effect on the sick but tell me lysicles would you judge physician by the sick who take his medicine and follow his prescriptions or by those who don doubtless by those who do well then what be we to say if great number of sick people refuse to take the medicine and instead of it take poison of directly opposite nature that have be prescribe by others whose concern it be to discredit the physician and his medicine to block men from use them and to destroy their effect by drug of their own be the physician to blame for the health trouble of those people by no mean by the same line of argument doesn it follow that the tendency of religious doctrines should be judge by the effect they produce not on all who hear them but only on those who accept or believe them it seem so if we be to be fair then shouldn we judge the effect of religion by the religious of faith by believers of christianity by christians but suspect there be very few of these sincere believers still win it suffice to justify our principles if in proportion to the number who accept them and the strength of the faith with which they be accept they produce good effect there may be more such believers than you think and if there aren isn that the fault of those who make it their proclaim purpose to lessen that number and who be those but the minute philosophers say it be owe to the clergy themselves to the wickedness and corruption of clergymen and who deny that there may be minute philosophers even among the clergy in such numerous body there be bind to be men of all sort but despite the cruel reproach fling at the clergy by their enemies think that any fair mind observer of men and things will be incline to regard those reproach as reveal fault in those who fling them as much as in the clergy at whom they be fling especially if he take into account the strident tone of those who censure the clergy don know enough of the world to claim to judge the virtue merit and wide range accomplishments of men in the various professions and anyway don like the odious work of comparison but will to say this the clergy in this region where live be by no mean disgrace to it on the contrary the people seem to profit greatly from their example and doctrine but suppose the clergy to be sinners and faulty as of course all men certainly be suppose you could detect here and there among them great crimes and vices what inference can you draw against the profession itself from its unworthy practitioners any more than the pride pedantry and bad live of some philosophers create case against philosophy or those of lawyers case against law it be certainly right to judge principles from their effect but then we must know them to be effect of those principles it precisely the method have follow with respect to religion and the minute philosophy can honestly say that never know any man or family become worse in proportion as they become religious but have often observe that minute philosophy be the worst thing that can get into family the easiest way to impoverish divide and disgrace it what have observe by this same method of trace cause from their effect be that the love of truth virtue and the happiness of mankind be good stuff for speeches but they aren what drive the clergy in their work if they be why would clergymen be as they all be so fond of abuse human reason disparage natural religion and trash the philosophers and scientists not all it true that christian favour confine reason within its proper bound but so do every reasonable man if we be forbid to get involve with unprofitable question empty philosophy and science that isn really science it doesn follow that all inquiries into profitable question useful philosophy and real science be unlawful no man of good sense will make those inferences it be generally acknowledge that there be natural religion that can be discover and prove by the light of reason to those who be capable of such proof but still it have to be admit that precepts and oracles from heaven be incomparably better suit to the improvement of ordinary folk and the good of society than be the reason of philosophers that why we don find that natural or rational religion ever become the popular national religion of any country it can be deny that in all heathen countries world of fables and superstitious rites have be accept under the colour of religion but question whether they be as absurd and harmful as they be vulgarly say to have be because their respective legislators and magistrates see note on page must surely have think them useful we don deny that there be something useful in the old religions of rome and greece and some other pagan countries on the contrary we freely admit that they have some good effect on the people but these good effect come from the truths contain in those false religions the more truth religion contain therefore the more useful it be think you ll have difficulty produce any useful truth any moral precept any healthy principle or notion in any non christian system of religion or philosophy that isn include in the christian religion where it be either enforce by stronger motives or support by better authority or carry to higher point of perfection so you want us to think ourselves finer people than the ancient greeks or romans if by finer you mean better perhaps we be and if we aren it not because we have the christian religion but because too many of us don alciphron protest that crito perhaps we be be indefensible he contrast cicero and brutus with an english patriot and seneca with one of our parsons crito reply that those great men be not the minute philosophers of their time and that the best of their principles be also christian ones he add that the current stand of some of the great men of the ancient world be partly due to their undeniable personal merit partly to favourable publicity and not at all to their not be christian as for more recent time careful look show great deal of moral improvement in europe under the influence of christianity for start he say let take look at england have hear much of the glorious light of the gospel and would be glad to see some effect of it in my own dear country which be incidentally one of the most corrupt and profligate on earth despite the boast purity of our religion but you wouldn be show much confidence in your religion if you compare it only with that of the barbarous heathen from whom we be derive if you want to honour your religion have the courage to make your comparison with the most renowned heathens of antiquity it be common prejudice to despise the present and over rate remote time and things there touch of this in the judgments men make concern the ancient greeks and romans those nations certainly do produce some noble spirit and great pattern of virtue but over all they seem to me to have be much inferior in real virtue and good morals to our corrupt and profligate nation so you call it to bring dishonour to our religion wonder how you would choose to describe it when you want to do honour to the minute philosophy crito back up his statement about the greeks and romans by cite examples the treatment of slave and prisoners of war kill of unwanted children gladiators and also bacchanals and unbridle lust of every kind these don have parallel in contemporary england he say largely because of christianity alciphron reply that crito be overlook facts that don fit his view cite the inhumanity of that barbarous custom of duel crito agree that duel be bad shan make an apology for every goth that walk the streets with determine purpose to murder any man who spit in his face or call him liar he go on to say that christianity isn responsible for this and alciphron say that that irrelevant to the immediate present topic which be just comparison of contemporary england with ancient greece and rome crito accept this and return to the comparison they be make say that duel isn as bad as the common roman practice of poison that very true duel be not as general nuisance as poison and it not so low either this crime if it be crime have good chance of hold on despite the law and the gospel the clergy never preach against it because they don suffer from it personally and man of honour mustn appear to oppose the mean of vindicate honour which be what duel be you aren the first free thinker to say that the clergy be not give to preach against duel but in my view that remark itself be unfair and so be your statement about why the clergy stay away from this topic in effect half of their sermons all that be say about charity brotherly love forbearance meekness and forgive injuries be directly against this wicked custom of duel as for the claim that they never suffer from it themselves that be so far from true that one can make case for say that they suffer from it oftener than other men how can you make good on that claim the ferocity of this passage suggest that it reflect berkeley own personal experience of be bully by cowards there be two kinds of bully the fight and the tame both public nuisances the fight bully be the more dangerous animal but there be far fewer of them than of tame bully the tame bully exert his talents against clergymen which the fight bully never do the qualities of man that make him count as tame bully be natural rudeness combine with delicate sense of danger mean danger to himself you see the fashionable custom of call men to account for their behaviour challenge them to duel have not lessen the force of inbred insolence and bad manners it have merely turn that force in new direction so you can often see one of these tame bully nearly burst with offend pride and bad temper that he dare not express openly because he be afraid of be challenge to duel until parson come his way provide relief give his angry state safe outlet but to return to our topic can you deny that the ancient romans be as famous for justice and integrity as today men be for the opposite qualities you can get the character of the romans from the opinions of cicero the action of cato or few shin episodes scatter through their history what you need to consider be the prevail tenor of their live and notions and then he say the picture change and he go on to cite examples of atrocious publicly approve conduct by the romans then venture to say that if you take roman history from one end to the other and impartially compare it with our own you win find the romans to be as good as you imagine or your countrymen to be as bad on the contrary really do think that an unbiased eye will detect vein of charity and justice an effect of christian principles run through england today crito pause and alciphron speak up address himself to euphranor and me it be natural for men accord to their various upbringings and prejudice to form opposite judgments about the same things crito for instance imagine that religion have only salutary effect but if you appeal to the general experience and observation of other men you ll find that the statement tantum religio potuit suadere malorum have grow into proverb which say that religion be the root of evil it be say by lucretius and wasn generalization about religion speak of agamemnon sacrifice of his daughter to goddess in the hope of get favourable wind for his attack on troy lucretius write so greatly be religion able to persuade man to do evil not just among epicureans or other ancient heathens but among moderns speak of the christian religion think it be unreasonable to set up against the general concur opinion of the world the observation of particular person or particular set of zealots whose prejudice stick close to them and keep mix in with their judgments zealots who read draw conclusions and observe with an eye not to discover the truth but to defend their prejudice notice how nasty the tone have become this be say about crito in his presence but not address to him directly although can share alciphron view admire his skill and dexterity in argument sometimes he represent an opinion acceptance by people in general as sure sign of its be wrong but when that doesn suit his purpose he just as easily make it sure sign of truth but the fact that an irreligious proverb be use by the friends and admire author of minute philosopher doesn imply that the proverb be something generally accept still less that it be truth base on the experience and observation of mankind and this one isn truth it would be as reasonable to think that darkness be natural effect of sunshine as to think that sullen and furious passions come from the glad tide and divine precepts of the gospel the sum and substance the scope and end of christ religion be the love of god and man all other doctrines and duties whether legal or moral be subordinate to this as part of it mean to it sign of it principles arise from it motives to adhere to it or effect of it tell me now how could evil or wickedness of any kind come from such source don say that there be no evil qualities in christians or that there be no good ones in minute philosophers but do say this whatever evil there be in us our principles certainly lead to good and whatever good there may be in you it be most certain that your principles lead to evil it must be admit that christianity look handsome on the outside and many plausible things can be say in favour of the christian religion take simply as we find it in the gospel he go on to report the view of one of our great writers shaftesbury that the first christian preachers sneakily make christianity look good all love charity meekness patience and so forth until they have convert much of the world and come to have political power and then they soon change their appearance and show cruelty ambition avarice and every bad quality crito respond that this be very stupid the first christian preachers die for their faith and yet ever since this religion have appear in the world we have have eternal feud factions massacre and war the very reverse of that hymn with which it be introduce in the gospel glory be to god on high on earth peace good will towards men crito accept this add that christianity be often the pretext for these evils but insist that this doesn mean it be their cause he then say that the evils of the christian era be match and outnumber by evils in pre christian time all these evils early and late be the common product of the passions and vices of mankind which be sometimes cover with the mask of religion by wicked men who have the form of godliness without the power of it this be so obviously true that surprise that any man of sense knowledge and candour can doubt it he return to ancient rome with more examples of horrors alciphron agree that the romans have high and fierce spirit which produce very bloody catastrophes but the ancient greeks he say be civilize and gentle sort of men soften by arts and philosophy crito reply that the little state and cities of greece as alciphron call them have their factions which persecute each other with such treachery rage and malice that our factious folk be mere lamb by comparison for evidence of this he refer to thucydides history of the war between athens and sparta and he express contempt for free thinkers divers to the bottom of things fair inquirers and openers of eye who be capable of such gross mistake as sentimentalise ancient greece the rest of mankind we could more easily give up but as for the greeks men of the most refine genius express high esteem of them not only on account of the qualities that you think fit to allow them but also for their virtues on the basis of the fullest and fairest observation can make think that if virtue stand for truth justice and gratitude there be incomparably more virtue right now in england than could ever be find in ancient greece he go on about the ingratitude that some greek state show to some of their citizens who have be benefactors and then move on to this as for the source of the chief advantage of the greeks and romans and other nations that have make the greatest figure in the world incline to think it be their special reverence for the laws and institutions of their countries these inspire them with steadiness and courage and with the heartfelt and noble love of their country and what they understand to be their country be not confine by language or ethnic origin still less by geographical location their notion of their country also take in certain system of manners customs notions rites and civil and religious laws can see your drift you want us to revere the laws and religious institutions of our country well excuse us if we don see fit to imitate the greeks or to be govern by any authority whatsoever sure you don if islam be establish by law don doubt that the free thinkers the very ones who applaud turkish maxims and manners so loudly that you think they be ready to turn turkish would be the first to protest against them but to return to our topic agree that there always have be war and factions in the world and that there always will be on some pretext or other as long as men be men but there specifically christian sort of war and sort of warrior one that the heathens have no notion of the noun divine have be replace by theologian in this version but its occurrence in this paragraph and the next be leave unaltered for reason that you ll see talk about dispute in theology the war and polemical divine the warriors which the world have be amazingly pester with if you take their word for it they be teach peace meekness harmony and whatnot but even cursory look at how they behave show them to have be all through the centuries the most contentious quarrelsome disagree crew that ever appear on earth the skill and trickery the zeal and eagerness with which the scholastic divine those barbarians split hairs and quarrel over non existent imagine things be more absurd and greater scandal to human reason than all the ambitious intrigue plot and politics of the court of ancient rome and make me even angrier than those do if divine be quarrelsome it not because they be divine but because they be undivine and unchristian justice be good thing and so be the art of heal yet men can be wrong in the administer of justice or poison in the give of medicine but just as wrong can be justice or an effect of justice and poison can be medicine or an effect of medicine so also pride or strife can be religion or an effect of religion have say that agree that you can often see hot head bigots sign up with religious party as well as political ones without be of credit or service to either for the next bite you need to remember that the scholastics be roman catholic philosophical theologians while berkeley be an anglican as for the scholastics in particular don think the christian religion have any need to defend them their doctrines or their method of handle them still however futile their view may be and however clumsy their language it simply not true that they sneer and scold and rant in their write and they be so far from show fury or passion that an impartial judge might rate them far ahead of the minute philosophers in keep close to the point and in their tone and good manners but anyway if men be puzzle tangle with one another talk nonsense and quarrel about religion they do the same about law medicine politics and everything else that matter it not just in divinity that men run into dispute trickery nonsense and contradictions it also happen in the other professions have mention and indeed in any pursuit where men have create abstract theory but this doesn stop there be many excellent rule sound ideas and useful truths in all those professions in all dispute human emotions too often get stir into the mix in proportion as the subject be think to be more or less important but we oughtn to confuse the cause of man with the cause of god or make human follies an objection to divine truths it easy to distinguish what look like wisdom from above from what come from the passion and weakness of men the distinction be so obvious that when someone doesn draw it one might be tempt to think that this be result not of ignorance but of something worse the hostile tone isn improve the conduct we cite in objections to minute philosophers be natural consequence of their principles anything they can cite in objections to us be an effect not of our principles but of human passion and frailty oh terrific so we must no longer cite in objections against christians the absurd contentions of councils the cruelty of inquisitions the ambition and power grab of churchmen you can cite them as objections against christians but not against christianity if the divine author of our religion and his disciples have sow good seed and if together with this good seed the enemies of his gospel include the minute philosophers of all age have sow bad seed from which weed and thistles grow isn it obvious that these bad weed can be blame on the good seed or on those who sow it he develop this point at considerable and not very interest length alciphron respond by shift to different complaint the triviality and unimportance of much theological write shan undertake to vindicate theological write as such general defence of them would be as needle as general accusation be groundless but let them speak for themselves and don condemn them on the word of minute philosopher anyway let look at the worst case imagine quarrelsome pedant in divinity who dispute and ruminate and write on some refine point that be as useless and unintelligible as you please but then ask yourself what would have become of this man if he have be bring up to be layman rather than cleric mightn he have employ himself in shifty business deal harass law suit factions seditions and such like amusements do much more harm to the public than he actually do with his useless theological study the two page between here and occupy five page in the original they aren of much philosophical interest alciphron complain that in theological dispute what men lack in light they commonly make up in heat crito reply that in any branch of study when some isolate point be be look into with great care that tend to generate an inflate sense of its importance but this be routine stuff and not special to theology alciphron complain that trivial theological squabble be regard as learn and the public take an interest in them as though they be sport events he object to theological write on stylistic ground what man of sense or breed would not detest the infection of long wind pulpit eloquence or of that dry formal pedantic stiff and clumsy style that smell of the lamp and the college those who be foolish enough to admire the universities as centre of learn must think that my reproach smell of the college be strange one but it be perfectly fair these days the ablest men agree that the universities be merely hot bed of prejudice corruption barbarism and pedantry speak for myself find no fault with universities all know be that have three hundred pound year to spend in one of them and it be the happiest time of my life as for their book and style of write didn have time to pay any attention to them whoever want to pull weed will never lack work there no shortage of bad book on every subject don know what theological write alciphron and his friends be familiar with but venture to say that our english theologians include many writers who for breadth of learn solidity of content strength of argument and purity of style be not inferior to any writers in our language as for our universities which be of course imperfect any impartial observer will find that with all their flaw they be better than universities in other countries and much better than the mean picture that minute philosophers draw of them it natural that the loudest complaints against place of education come from those who have profit least by them crito mistake the point be rely on the authority not of dunce or rake or an absurd parent examples that crito have use but of the most accomplish critic this age have produce this great man characterize men of the church and universities with the finest touch and most masterly pencil what do you think he call them what why the black tribe magicians formalists pedants beard boys and after have sufficiently deride and explode them and their mean and crude learn he provide the most admirable model of good write namely his own write they have to be acknowledge as the finest things in our language as could easily convince you for also have with me something by that noble writer after an exchange about noble writer who be also nobleman in fact shaftesbury alciphron take book from his pocket and start to read long flowery unclear passage in which idleness be praise as be better than busy greed it be quote verbatim from shaftesbury book characteristics of etc except that berkeley mischievously put it on the page as fifty line blank verse of which this be typical but here busy form solicit us active industrious watchful and despise pain and labour she wear the serious countenance of virtue but with feature of anxiety and disquiet what be she mutter what look she on with such admiration and astonishment and so on until euphranor interrupt with protest why should we interrupt our discussion to read play it isn play or poetry alciphron reply but famous modern critic moralize in prose he go on about this great man discoveries and his write euphranor comment sarcastically on the kind of man who offer to reform the style and taste of the age and alciphron not hear the sarcasm continue enthusiastically about the admire critic of our time who have among other things argue that shakespeare milton and others have be greatly over rat euphranor ask what effect this great man have have on the public do they aspire to his sublimity or imitate his chaste unaffected style alciphron still naively enthusiastic say that the taste of the age be much mend crito get in slap at the write style of minute philosophers and then shift the conversation back towards where it be few minutes ago when your great man tell us that ignorance and ill taste be due to the christian religion or the clergy can just take his word for it the truth be the opposite of that crito say in speech that be sum up in this everyone who know anything know that we be indebted for our learn to the greek and latin tongue and that we be indebted for those tongue to our religion what else could have make foreign and dead languages in such demand among us alciphron speak harshly of one sort of learn that be undoubtedly of christian origin and special to the universities he deplore the years that young people waste in acquire the mysterious jargon of scholasticism and the further years they have to spend be unteach it by the world but what if this scholastic learn be not of christian but of moslem origin be derive from the arabs and what if this complaint about gentlemen spend several years in learn and unlearn this jargon be just sham and this be say sarcastically specimen of the truth and candour of certain minute philosophers surely it wouldn be such deplorable loss of time if young gentleman spend few months on the much despise and decry art of logic surplus of logic be by no mean the prevail nuisance of this age it be one thing to waste one time learn and unlearn the barbarous term ultra fine distinctions and long wind sophistry of the scholastics it another to attain some exactness in define and argue things that may be not altogether beneath the dignity even of minute philosopher logic use to be regard as its own object self sufficient subject all on its own so that the art of reason instead of be transfer to things be aim only at word and abstractions which produce sort of leprosy in all branch of knowledge but those time be past and logic once cultivate as the chief branch of knowledge be now consider in another light it doesn play anything like the part in the study of young gentlemen at the universities that be attribute to it by those admirable reformers of religion and learn the minute philosophers crito go on to say that the restoration of arts and civilize learn have be due to the influence of christians whom he name at length in the course of this he speak of the great scholars who flourish on the other side of the alps in the golden age as the italians call it of pope leo the tenth and alciphron challenge this say that the noble critic from whom he quote few minutes ago regard the italians as corrupters of true learn and erudition crito reply with some slight remark about the noble critic and surprisingly lysicles back him up say in effect that someone who write so much about art and taste and critical skill oughtn to write as badly as that man shaftesbury do in the course of some further skirmish between alciphron and crito about whether and to what extent english culture be indebted to church or universities or ancient languages crito speak of christianity as generator of arts and sciences and also of the general sense of virtue and humanity and the belief in providence and after life which all the argumentation of minute philosophers have not yet be able to abolish that remark bring the topic of christianity and culture to an end because alciphron reply it be strange that you still persist in argue as though all the gentlemen of our sect be enemies to virtue and downright atheists when have assure you that on the contrary we have among us number of people who announce their support for virtue and natural religion and have also assure you that myself now argue on that basis how can you claim to support natural religion and yet be open enemies of christianity which be the only establish religion that include whatever be excellent in natural religion and which be the only mean of make those precepts duties and notions become reverence throughout the world suppose someone try to persuade people that he be greatly in support of particular earthly monarch that he love and admire his government while at the same time he take every opportunity to express himself as most bitter enemy of the very persons and methods that contribute most to the monarch service and to make his dignity know and revere his laws observe or his dominion extend wouldn such person be think weak or insincere and isn this just what minute philosophers like you do announce themselves as advocate of god and religion and yet do all they can to discredit christians and their worship admittedly you argue against christianity in one way that doesn necessarily express hostility to religion as such namely by represent christianity as the cause of evil and wickedness in the world but that line of argument could be use with equal force against civil government food and drink every faculty and profession learn eloquence and even against human reason itself and even those of your sect who allow themselves to be call deists if their view be thoroughly examine will be find to include little religion in them as for god providence watch over our conduct and dispense bless or hardships the immortality of the soul the last judgment and an after life with reward and punishments those be great point of natural religion but how few if any of your free thinkers have try to get men to have serious sense of them how many go the opposite way try to make the belief in them shaky or ridiculous when man declare principles and personal beliefs be utterly subversive of the things list above anything he say about virtue piety and religion will be understand as merely play safe and not be conspicuous frankly have never have any like for religion of any kind reveal or unrevealed what unrevealed be natural religion and venture to say the same for any gentlemen of our sect that be acquaint with have never know any of them do anything as low as use the word god with reverence or express respect for piety or for any sort of worship he add detail about ways in which minute philosopher may talk as though he have respect for christianity explain that this be never to be take seriously and literally then after all these arguments and ideas that beget one another without end here be my view in nutshell my friends and can for the life of us see why man mightn do very well and govern himself without any religion at all brutes do it and they be think to be less capable than men you say that brutes have instincts sense appetites and passions to steer and conduct them well men have all those and also have reason that they can consult when they need to from these premise my friends and conclude the road of human life be well enough light without religion brutes don have much power of think and it be confine to particular things that be present to the animal so they be sufficiently restrain and keep in order by the force or faculties of other animals and by the skill of man and conscience and religion don come into this in contrast with that human reason be faculty of vast extent and power especially power to do mischief and conscience be necessary balance to it and another point by the law of their nature non human animals be push to one particular end or manner of existence without inclination or mean either to deviate from that or to go beyond it but man have in him will and higher principle through which he can pursue different or even contrary end and he can fall short of or exceed the perfection natural to his species in this world just as he can either hand over control to his sensual appetites thereby degrade himself into the condition of brutes or else well order and improve his mind thereby upgrade himself into something resemble an angel man be the only animal with enough understand to know his god what the use of this knowledge if it isn to ennoble man to raise him to level where he be more like god and more in touch with god and what would the good of such ennoblement be if it end with this life and how can these things happen without religion but we have already discuss at great length the topics of vice and virtue man and beast sense and intellect lysicles surely you don want us to go back to where we be three or four days ago by no mean would much rather go forward and make an end as soon as possible but to save us all trouble let me tell you once for all that whatever you say you ll never persuade me that so many able and agreeable men be in the wrong and pack of snarl sour bigots in the right lysicles don look for religion among bigots or for reason among libertines each kind disgrace their respective position the bigot exert an angry zeal for things that hardly matter and the libertine pay no attention to even the plainest and most important truths and surely whatever there be that silly narrow and uncharitable in the bigot the same be in great measure to be attribute to the conceited ignorance and petulant irreligion of the libertine lysicles ignore this and round on alciphron have always think he say that nothing could be sillier than to think of destroy christianity by praise natural religion you can consistently think well of one and poorly of the other because it obvious that natural religion need the help of reveal religion if it be ever to be establish and accept anywhere except in the brain of few idle speculative men know what your concessions would come to anyone with half an eye can see that the belief in god virtue an after life and such fine notions be the very basis and corner stone of the christian religion give them this foundation to build on and you ll soon see what superstructures our theologians will raise from it admit the truth and importance of those doctrines and you don have to be conjurer to prove from that the excellence and usefulness of the christian religion and then of course there must be priests to teach and propagate this useful religion and if there be priests provision will have to make for their maintenance enable them to perform all their rites and ceremonies in decent fashion and to keep their sacred character respect and the plain upshot of all this be that the monarch will ally himself with the priesthood in order to subdue the people so we have open the gate to long procession of ecclesiastical evils priestcraft hierarchy inquisition we have lose our liberty and property the nation have be put to vast expense simply to purchase bridle for our mouth and saddle for our back he say this with some sharpness of tone and scold manner alciphron be upset but say nothing and show confusion in his look crito look at euphranor and me with smile then look over at the two philosophers he say if you ll allow me to intervene to prevent rupture between old friends and brethren in opinion would remark that in what lysicles have just say there be something right and something wrong it seem right to assert as he do that real belief in natural religion will lead man to approve of reveal religion but it be wrong to say that inquisitions tyranny and ruin must follow from this your free thinkers no offence mean seem to mistake where their strength lie they imagine strongly but reason weakly they be mighty in exaggeration but thin in argument isn there some way to relieve them from the terror of that fierce and bloody animal an english parson win it be enough to trim his talons without chop off his finger then they be such wonderful defenders of liberty and property he tell an anti pope story to illustrate his thesis that we may see every day both things and notions be attribute to liberty and property that in fact don have and aren mean to have anything to do with either of them really be it impossible for man to be christian without be slave or to be clergyman without have the principles of an inquisitor be far from shield and justify the greed for domination or tyrannical power in ecclesiastics some who have be guilty of that have pay dearly for it and it be to be hop they always will but once we have calm the fury and folly of the ambitious bishop isn it time to look see whether some evil mightn come to the state from different source the overflow zeal of an independent whig believer in primitive christianity who be oppose to the establish church of england ll tell you this without bother to prove it the worst tyranny this nation ever felt be from the hand of patriots of that kind don know tyranny be harsh word and be sometimes misapply when spirit men with independent view create ferment or make change in the state those who lose by the change be apt to consider things in one light and those who win to consider them in another in the mean time this be certainly good policy we should be spar with our money and keep it for better use than to spend on the church and religion what follow be longish discussion of property right the legal basis for the ownership of land by the church and so on then can never hope crito to make you think that my scheme be reasonable you and each argue correctly on our own principles and we ll never agree until we drop our principles and that can be do by reason we all talk of just and right and wrong and public good and so on we use the same name but our notions and conclusions be very different perhaps diametrically opposite and yet the conclusions on each side may admit of clear proof and be infer by the same method of reason for instance the members of club belong to define man as sociable animal and so we don count as men the human creatures of whom it can be say that we prefer their absence to their presence by this standard it clear that men of pleasure good humour men and men of wit be the only human creatures who properly and truly count as men therefore whatever be conducive to good incomes for them be for the good of mankind and consequently very just and lawful even though it seem to bring loss or harm to other creatures say seem because no real harm can be do in respect of life or property to those who don know how to enjoy life and property we hold this on the basis of clear and well connect reason but others may view things in another light give different definitions draw different conclusions and perhaps regard as wart or tumour of human nature what we think to be the top and flower of the creation from all which there must arise very different system of morals politics right and notions lysicles then swing into jokey classification of men that someone invent in which kinds of men at give the name of kinds of animals thus accord to this system the fish be the men who swim in pleasure the beasts be dry drudge covetous rapacious folk and all those addict to trouble and business like oxen and other dry land animals which spend their live in labour and fatigue the bird be airy notional men enthusiasts projectors poets philosophers and such like if you ask me which species of mankind like best answer the fly fish man of animal enjoyment with mixture of whim thus you see we have our creeds and our systems just as more solemn folk do with this difference that our systems be not strait lace not strap on tightly but sit easy to be slip off or on as the mood take us or the occasion serve and now can listen with the greatest equanimity imaginable to my opinions be argue against or refute wish all men be like that but you ll find sort of men needn name the sort that can endure have their opinions examine or their fault criticize they be against reason because reason be against them we free thinkers be all for liberty of conscience if our tenets be absurd we allow them to be freely argue against and inspect and by parity of reason we might hope to be allow the same privilege regard the opinions of other men alciphron war that can stand the light be indeed suspect so whatever move you to make this complaint promise you that never will up to now have allow your reason its full scope and ll always do so in the future but for the love of truth be candid and don spend your strength and our time on matter that aren significant or be irrelevant to our topic or have be agree between us we allow that tyranny and slavery be bad things but why should we fear them from the clergy at this time we agree that rites and ceremonies aren of central importance in religion but why should we ridicule things that in their own nature be not bad and may be good and that bear the stamp of supreme authority freely admit that men in theology as well as other subject get tangle in useless dispute and will probably go on do so till the end of the world but why must all the human weakness and mistake of clergymen be attribute to wicked design why indiscriminately abuse their character and their beliefs be this like candour love of truth and free think grant bad temper and ill breed can occasionally be find in the clergy but aren the same fault find in english laymen who have spend their live in seclude rural environment grant that there endless futility in the work of the scholastics but deny that volume of that do as much harm as page of minute philosophy that weak or wicked men should by favour of the world creep into power and high position in the church there nothing surprise in that and it be natural to suppose that once they be in those position they will behave like themselves but through all this it be obvious that what drive them in their unworthy achievements be not the gospel but the world not the spirit but the flesh not god but the devil we don shrink from agree that nothing be more infamous than vice and ignorance in clergyman nothing lower than hypocrite more trivial than pedant more cruel than an inquisitor but you should agree in your turn gentlemen that nothing be more ridiculous and absurd than for pedantic ignorant and corrupt men to throw the first stone at every shadow of their own defect and vices in other men when think about the detestable state of slavery and superstition feel my heart swell to take in the utter bless of independent liberty this be the sacred and high privilege the very life and health of our english constitution so you mustn be surprise if we with vigilant and search eye guard it against the minutest appearance of evil you must even allow us to cut around it go deep and use magnify glass so as better to see and extirpate every least speck that appear in the freedom that we be careful to preserve and angry to see threaten as for unrestricted liberty leave that to savage who think be the only ones who have it but as for the reasonable legal liberty of our constitution most heartily and sincerely wish it may to survive and flourish among us for ever he say that any amount of vigilance be justify if it stop attempt to change our free and gentle government into slavish or severe one but how he demand can one get out of this any basis for an attack on religion there follow an discussion of right of suppression alciphron report magistrate who be so hard press by free thinkers that he couldn find anything to say in defence of his religion except that if ten million people inhabit the same island want to have laws establish religion in certain ways and ten thousand able men publicly sneer at those laws the ten million would be entitle to expel the ten thousand out of the island and what answer would you make to this remark of the magistrate the answer be obvious by the law of nature which be superior to any human institutions intelligence and knowledge have right to command folly and ignorance say that able men have by natural right dominion over fool this doctrine however be never thoroughly understand until quite recently after conversation about hard press individual magistrate alciphron will now revert to use the magistrate in the manner describe in note on page as kind of short hand for the law make and law enforce authorities of the country generation back hobbes and his followers though otherwise very great men declare in favour of the religion of the magistrate probably because they be afraid of the magistrate but time have change and the magistrate may now be afraid of us crito briefly comment on this and then launch into an anecdote that start brief and inconclusive discussion of the legal requirement that only profess christians could serve on juries then this much be certain the christian reform religion be principal part and corner stone of our free constitution and really think it be the only thing that make us deserve freedom and make us able to enjoy it freedom be either bless or curse depend on how men use it if our religion be wipe out among us and the ideas that be regard by free thinkers as prejudice of christian education be erase from the mind of britons it seem to me that the best thing that could then happen would be the loss of our freedom people who have such restless ambition such strength of feel such enmity between factions so much at stake in contest such unrestricted licence of speech and press amid so much wealth and luxury the only thing that have so far keep them from ruin be the hoary old wive tales he use latin phrase quote persius as on page that you claim to be wipe out under the christian religion this nation have be greatly improve from be sort of savage we have become civilize polish and learn we have make decent and noble figure both at home and abroad and as our religion decrease be afraid we shall be find to have decline so why should we persist in that dangerous experiment one would think crito that you have forget the many calamities cause by churchmen and religion and one would think that you have forget what we say this very day in answer to that objection don want to go on for ever say the same things so ll make just three point if we reflect on the past state of the christian world and especially of our country with our feud and factions that exist while we all have the same religion the war of the roses so violent and bloody and long we may well suspect that the nastiness that have more recently show up under the mask of religion would have break out under some other pretext if religion hadn be available it doesn follow from anything you can say about our history that the evils accidentally arise from religion bear any proportion to the good effect it have really produce or to the evils it have prevent the best things can accidentally give rise to evil and such an accidental effect be not strictly speak produce by the good thing itself but by some evil thing not part property or effect of it that happen to coincide with it think we have give enough discussion to the topic of today session must acknowledge that there something in what crito have say about the usefulness of the christian religion lysicles may not like this but owe it to my status as fair impartial adversary to say this ll even admit that some of our sect be in favour of tolerate christianity remember meet of number of able men where after much debate we pass three resolutions the first be that no religion ought to be tolerate in the state but this on more mature think be judge impracticable the second be that all religions should be tolerate but none look on with favour except atheism but it be fear that this might make trouble among the lower sort of people the third resolution be that some religion or other should be establish for the use of the vulgar after long dispute about which religion this should be it be propose that the present religion might be tolerate until better one be find but while grant that christianity be expedient can never think it true while there be unanswerable objections to it be it all right if present those at our next meet to which we all agree sixth dialogue monday in the original work this be by considerable margin the longest of the dialogues but not in this version from which much of the philosophically uninteresting material have be cut dion report that on the sunday the various people spend the day in their characteristic ways then the next morning we assemble at the same place as on saturday and when we be all seat remark that during the precede week our discussion have be longer and less interrupt than have ever know in town where men hours be break by visit business and amusements so much so that anyone who settle for form his ideas wholly from conversation must end up with ideas that be very shatter and incomplete and what have we achieve reply alciphron through all these continue discussions for my part think that with regard to the main point that divide us the truth of the christian religion just where be at the outset answer that so many point have be examine discuss and agree between him and his adversaries that hop to see them eventually agree on everything for in the first place say the principles and opinions of those who be call free thinkers or minute philosophers have be pretty clearly explain it have be also agree that vice isn beneficial to the nation in the way that some men imagine it be that virtue be highly useful to mankind but that the beauty of virtue be not enough on its own to get men to be virtuous that therefore the belief in god and providence ought to be encourage in the state and tolerate in good company as useful notion and it have be prove that there be god that it be reasonable to worship him and that the worship faith and principles prescribe by the christian religion be good influence alciphron reply be address to even if everything that dion have just say be true he say that doesn move me an inch from where be at the outset regard the main point that because nothing in all this prove the truth of the christian religion though each of the detail dion have list might create prejudice in its favour so must be on my guard against be prejudice person prejudice in favour of christianity as lover of truth must look sharp and consider carefully every step take you may remember alciphron that you suggest as today topic certain difficulties and objections that you have to offer against the christian religion we be now ready to hear and consider anything of that kind that you think fit to produce atheism and the wrong idea of christianity as something harmful to mankind be great prejudice and man lose them may make him more apt to argue with candour and submit to reasonable proof but lose prejudice against an opinion as you have do isn the same as acquire prejudice in its favour as you fear you may have do so we have reason to hope that you ll be able to do justice to your cause without be uncritically in love with it after self congratulatory open alciphron say that he will do his best to share with those who be wander lower down in the narrow dark paths of error the view of things that he have achieve from his lofty stand above the reach of prejudice then know then that each of the various group of men have faith and religious system that sprout from the common grain of enthusiasm that they all have grain that be basic ingredient in the mix of human nature each group tell of communication with the invisible world revelations from heaven divine oracles and the like when consider all these claim with an impartial eye can possibly assent to them all and find within myself something that restrain me from assent to any of them will to go where be lead by common sense and the light of nature but the same reason that tell me to yield to rational proof forbid me to accept opinions without proof this hold in general against all revelations all let this be count as my first objection against the christian religion in particular this objection presuppose that there no proof or reason for believe the christian revelation so if good reason can be assign for such belief the objection come to nothing now presume you ll agree that true and proper reason for believe report be the authority of the person who make it and the better his authority the sounder the claim his report have to our assent well now the authority of god be on all account the best so it be most reasonable to believe anything that come from god mean anything that be tell to us by god agree but then you have to prove that it do come from god and aren miracles and the fulfilment of prophecies join with the excellence of its doctrine sufficient proof that the christian religion come from god miracles would indeed prove something but what proof have we of these miracles proof of the same kind that we do have the only kind we can have of events that occur long ago and far away we have authentic account pass down to us from eye witness whom we can conceive to have be tempt to deceive us by any human motive whatsoever why can we because in give these account they be act contrary to their interest their prejudice and the very principles in which they have be nurse and bring up these account be confirm by the unparalleled raze of the city of jerusalem and the scatter of the jewish nation which be an endure testimony to the truth of the gospel particularly of the predictions of our bless saviour for example and when ye shall see jerusalem compass with armies then know that the desolation thereof be nigh luke within less than century these account be spread throughout the world and believe by great number of people they be also write down translate into numerous languages and hand down with the same respect and consent of christians in the most distant church don you see say alciphron star straight at crito that all this depend on tradition and tradition believe me give only weak hold it be chain whose first link may be stronger than steel and yet the last ones weak as wax and brittle as glass imagine picture copy successively by hundred painters each copy from the one before how like the original will the last copy be how lively and clear will an image be after hundred reflections between two parallel mirror that how like and lively think faint vanish tradition will be at the end of sixteen or seventeen centuries some men have false heart others wrong head and even when heart and head be both good memory may be treacherous something get add something omit something vary from the truth and the cumulative result of many such additions deductions and alterations through the centuries the bottom line be quite different from what the tradition start with we can know ancient facts by oral tradition or write tradition and write tradition may be either private keep in the hand of particular men or public record in public archive now as far as can see all these three sort of tradition agree in attest to the genuine antiquity of the gospels and they be strengthen by supplementary evidence from rites institute festivals observe and build church baptistries and sepulchres put up by ancient christians grant that your objection hold against oral tradition on its own can think it be so difficult to transcribe faithfully and once something have be put in write it be secure against slip of memory and can with reasonable care be preserve intact for as long as the manuscript last which we know from experience can be more than thousand years tradition of more than sixteen hundred years need only two or three link in its chain he give an example and despite the great length of time those link may be very sound and unbroken and no reasonable man will deny that an ancient manuscript may be as credible now as when it be first write we have it on good authority and anyway it seem probable that the first christians be careful to transcribe copy of the gospels and epistles for their private use and that other copy be preserve as public record in many church throughout the world and that portion of them be constantly read in their assemblies what more could be say to prove the authenticity of the write of classic author or ancient record of any kind alciphron turn to euphranor and say silence an adversary be different from convince him don you agree euphranor oh yes they be different but what want be to be convince it not so clear to me that you do look however will man be to be convince he can be convince by probable arguments when there be demonstration go the other way agree that he can well it be as obvious as demonstration can make it that no divine faith can possibly be build on tradition take the case of an honest credulous farmer who be drill and lecture every sunday by his parish priest clearly it the parson he believe in not god all he know about revelations doctrines and miracles be what the priest tell him he believe all this and his faith be purely human if you say he have the liturgy and the bible as foundation for his faith the difficulty still recur as regard the liturgy he pin his faith on the civil magistrate as well as the ecclesiastic one and neither of those can claim divine inspiration as for the bible he take both that and his prayer book on trust from the printer who he believe make true editions from true copy so faith be at work here but faith in what faith in the priest in the magistrate in the printer editor transcriber none of whom can possibly be claim to be divine have the hint for this argument from cratylus it an arrow out of his quiver sharp one let me get hold of this arrow and try it out for myself suppose that your farmer hear magistrate declare the law from the bench or suppose he read it in statute book do you think that the magistrate or the printer be the true and proper object of his faith and submission or do you acknowledge higher authority on which their official action be base again if you read passage in the roman historian tacitus that you believe to be true would you say you assent to it on the authority of the printer or transcriber rather than the historian maybe maybe not don think oblige to answer these question all you be do be to transfer the question from one subject to another what we be discuss be not law or non religious history but religious tradition and divine faith can see well enough which way you be head but ll never accept that you can solve one difficulty by start up another alciphron you expect others to stay fair and stand firm as you choose to express it on page while you pluck out their prejudice but you elude our grasp at every turn how can euphranor argue with you if not from your concessions and how can he know what they be unless you tell him my question admit of only two answer take your pick from one of the answer it will follow that by parity of reason we can easily conceive how man can have divine faith without ever feel inspiration or see miracle that be because it be equally possible for mind to which divine revelation have come by some channel oral or scriptural to carry its think and submission back up that channel to the source end up with faith not in human but in divine authority its proper and true object be not the mechanisms and agents of the channel but rather the great origin itself from the other answer it will follow that you re introduce general scepticism into human knowledge and smash the hinge on which civil government and all the affairs of the world turn in short you ll destroy human faith in order to get rid of divine leave it to you to consider how well this go with your announcement that you want to be convince really would be glad to be convince one way or other to come to some conclusion but have so many objections in store that you shouldn attach much weight to your deal with one of them depend on it you ll find me behave like gentleman and lover of truth ll state my objections briefly and plainly and accept reasonable answer as fast as you can give them come on euphranor make the best case you can for your tradition you can never present as constant and universal tradition one that be admit to have be unknown or at best dispute in the church for several centuries and this be the case with the new testament for though we now have settle canon mean that the church hierarchy eventually decide which book should be include in the new testament and which should not everyone must see and admit that tradition can grow stronger by age and that anything that be uncertain in the earliest christian time can be undoubted later on what do you say to this euphranor like to get clearer about your mean before give an answer this objection of yours seem to presuppose that tradition that have be constant and undisputed may be admit as proof but that where the tradition be defective the proof must be so too be this your mean it be so the gospels and the epistles of st paul which be universally accept from the start and have never since be doubt of by the church must be accept as genuine and since these book contain all those point that be in controversy between you and me don need to argue with you about the authority of other book of the new testament that didn come to be generally know and accept in the church until later someone who assent to the undisputed book be no longer an unbeliever even if he doesn regard the book of revelation or the epistles of st jam or st jude or st peter or the last two epistles of st john as deserve to be in the canon the additional authority of these portion of the bible may carry weight in particular controversies between christians but it can add anything to arguments against an unbeliever as such when you be christian it will be time enough to argue about the status of those book and you ll be nearer to be christian if your way there be shorten by the omission of that question for the present not as near as you may think despite all the fair and plausible things you may say about tradition when consider the spirit of forgery that reign in primitive time and reflect on the many gospels act and epistles that be attribute to the apostles and then come to be recognize as spurious confess that can help suspect the whole bible tell me alciphron do you suspect that all plato write be spurious because the dialogue on death be agree to be so win you accept any of cicero write as genuine because sigonius pass off book that he have write as cicero de consolatione and the deception succeed for some time suppose admit as genuine the work of cicero and plato that be commonly accept as genuine what then why then would want to know whether it balance and impartial in free thinker to measure the credibility non religious and sacred book by different standards let us know what we christians be allow to work with when we argue with minute philosophers be we allow the benefit of common maxims in logic and criticism if so then please give reason why write which in the style and manner and matter bear visible sign of be fraudulent and have accordingly be reject by the church can be use as an argument against write that have be universally accept and hand down by unanimous constant tradition don know of anything truly valuable that hasn be counterfeit so your argument have universal scope but something that tell against everything doesn hold against anything it would seem as silly to reject the genuine write of non religious author because of the fake as it would be unreasonable to suppose that the heretics and the many sects of christians wouldn have include anyone capable of that kind of deceit see no way of judge this at such great distance of time it be all dark and doubtful mere guess work crito intervene with list of the reason there be to trust the judgments of the church councils about what be spurious and what genuine alciphron then move to new point the bible be not well enough write to have be divinely inspire euphranor say that that not decisive even an earthly monarch leave the detail word of his laws and proclamations to his secretaries and clerk to express his sense in their own word also some roughness of style match the roughness we find in large scale nature for example there be never really straight shore line though we do find geometrically exact shape in the work of insects so it seem that scrupulous attention to what men call the rule of art be not observe in the big productions of the author of nature alciphron reply that that all right as regard niceties of grammar and expression but he still count it against the divine inspiration idea that so much of the bible be write in flat characterless bore way euphranor explode alciphron if dare to follow my own judgment would be apt to think there be noble beauties in the style of the bible in the narrative part simple and unaffected manner in the devotional and prophetic part an animate and sublime style and in the doctrinal part such an air of dignity and authority as seem to declare that their origin be divine but shan set up my judgment on such delicate matter against that of the wits and men of genius who be so plentiful in your sect nor be tempt to do so because it seem to me that this latest argument of yours be worthless anyway something isn show not be the oracle of god by be deliver in plain dress rather than in the entice word of man wisdom this may perhaps work as defence of some simplicity and carelessness in write but what defence can there be for nonsense crude nonsense could easily give many examples because once read the bible the whole way through look for them look at the th psalm in this bible that have here the author begin very grandly call on all the inhabitants of the earth to listen and assure them that his mouth will speak of wisdom and the meditation of his heart will be of understand but he have no sooner finish this preface than he put this senseless question wherefore should fear in the days of evil when the wickedness of my heel shall compass me about the wickedness of my heel what nonsense after such solemn introduction have naturally weak eye and many things that can see be clearly see by others so don conclude that thing be absolutely invisible because can see it well it may be with my understand the way it be with my eye so don venture to declare thing to be nonsense because don understand it he then go through several interpretations that have be suggest for the passage treat it as some kind of metaphor or as involve hebrew idiom that we don have in english crito chime in with bore anecdotes about foreigners who have be mislead by english idioms then euphranor resume in this very psalm that you have pick on should have think that the good sense and morality contain in what follow the obscure bite would make fair mind reader judge favorably concern the original sense of the author in the part that he couldn understand tell me alciphron when you be read the classics and encounter something that you can make sense of do you immediately conclude that it be nonsense by no mean we have to expect difficulties to arise from different idioms old customs hint and allusions that may be clear at one time or place and obscure at another then why win you judge passages of the bible by the same rule the source of obscurity that you mention be all common both to religious and non religious write and there no doubt that in both sort of write the difficulties would vanish if we have more detail knowledge of the languages and circumstances he give an example phrase in the book of jeremiah that look odd unless one know certain things about life near the river jordan here and there difficult passage may be clear up but there be many that can be explain away by any exercise of human skill or ingenuity what do you say you about the discoveries that some of our learn writers have make of false citations from the old testament find in the new testament some new testament citations of passages in the old testament aren exactly accurate this have be know for centuries by christian writers it isn new discovery by minute philosophers it can be explain by errors of transcription and be of no great importance he develop this reply at some length conclude what can you infer from all this except that the design of the bible be not to give us exact knowledge of every detail and that the holy spirit didn dictate every particle and syllable and miraculously preserve them from even the slightest alteration alciphron renew his attack on the bible style and euphranor renew his defence then it wouldn be problem for me to admit that popular incorrect style might serve the general end of revelation as well as more precise and exact one but can get over the obscurity if the supreme be have speak to man it seem to me he would have speak clearly and the word of god wouldn need commentaries see note on page you seem to think that obscurity be defect but if it turn out not to be one that will be the end of this objection of yours ii now speech and style be instrumental in the convey of thoughts and notions in get knowledge opinion and assent iii and the perfection of an instrument should be measure by the use for which it be intend iv so something that be defect in one instrument may be no defect in another for instance edge tool be in general design to cut but because the use of an axe and razor be different it not defect in an axe that it isn as sharp as razor or in the razor that it isn as strong and heavy as an axe so we can say in general that any instrument be perfect if it suit the purpose or intention of the person who use it vi from which it seem to follow that no man speech be defective in clearness if it isn intelligible to all men but be intelligible enough to the ones the speaker intend should understand it or if it isn equally clear in all part or doesn convey perfect knowledge all through but do convey an imperfect hint which be all the speaker intend vii so we need to know the intention of the speaker if we be to know whether his style be obscure through defect or design viii but no one man can possibly know all the end and purpose of god revelations so for all you know to the contrary the obscurity of some part of the bible may fit quite well with purpose that you don know in which case they aren evidence that the bible doesn come from god the book of the bible be write in ancient languages at distant time on various occasion and on very different subject doesn that make it reasonable to think that some part or passages might have be clearly enough understand by those for whose use they be principally design and yet seem obscure to us who speak another language and live at another time be it at all absurd or unsuitable to our ideas of god and man to suppose that god may reveal but be reserve about how much he reveal on certain remote and sublime subject content to give us hint and glimpse rather than clear view may we not also suppose as something reasonable and suggest by the analogy of nature that some point that could have be more clearly explain be leave obscure merely to encourage our diligence and modesty two virtues which if it wouldn seem disrespectful to such great men would recommend to the minute philosophers lysicles reply this indeed be excellent you expect that men of sense and spirit should in great humility put out their eye and blindly swallow all the absurdities and nonsense that be offer to them as divine revelation on the contrary want them to open their eye look sharply and try the spirit berkeley phrase to see whether it be of god rather than passively and ignorantly condemn all religions together if they would compare the christian system with other claimants to divine revelation consider impartially the doctrines precepts and events contain in christianity weigh them in the balance against any other religious natural moral or historical account and examine diligently all the proof internal and external that for so many age have be able to influence and persuade so many wise learn and inquire men they might find in christianity certain special feature that sufficiently distinguish it from all other religions and suppose revelations as basis for reasonable faith if that happen leave it to the minute philosophers to consider whether they be right to take revelation so distinguish and attest and dismiss it with impatient scorn because some part of it be obscure he return to the topic of obscurity in texts write in an ancient foreign language the likelihood that we win know all the idioms and so on and repeat his plea for judge religious write in the same manner as non religious ones you may lecture and expound but nothing you have say or can say alter the fact that revelation that doesn reveal be mere contradiction in term tell me alciphron don you accept that the light of the sun be the most glorious production of providence in this natural world suppose do well this light that you can deny be make by god shin only on the surface of things doesn shine in the night shin imperfectly in the twilight be often interrupt refract and obscure represent distant things and small things dubiously imperfectly or not at all isn all this true it be doesn it follow that to expect in this world constant uniform light from god without any mixture of shade or mystery would be to depart from the rule and analogy of the creation and that therefore it wrong to argue that the light of revelation be not divine because it not as so clear and full as you expect or because it doesn shine equally at all time and in all place because claim to be fair and unbiased in this debate have to admit that you say some plausible things as man of argument will always be able to do in vindication of his prejudice but should come into the open and tell you once for all that however much you question and answer illustrate and enlarge you win convince me that the christian religion be divinely reveal in support of this attitude have say several things and have many more to say that carry weight not only with myself but with many great men who be good friends of mine and they win stop carry weight no matter what euphranor say on the other side envy you the happiness of know such people can have that advantage live as do in this out of theway place so have to make the most of this opportunity that you and lysicles have put into my hand regard you as two able physicians and you be please to consider me as patient whom you have generously undertake to cure now patient must be completely free to explain his case and report all his symptoms because conceal symptom might prevent perfect cure so please understand me not as object to or argue against either your skill or your medicine but only as report on my condition and on the effect your medicine have on me alciphron didn you give me to understand that you would wipe out my prejudice it be true good physician eradicate every fibre of the disease come you shall have patient hear tell me didn plato believe that god inspire particular men as organs or trumpet to proclaim and sound forth his oracles to the world and wasn the same opinion also embrace by other great writers of antiquity socrates seem to have think that all true poets speak by inspiration and cicero hold that there be no extraordinary genius without it what would you infer from this would infer that inspiration shouldn seem impossible or absurd but rather agreeable to the light of reason and the notions of mankind you ll agree with this suppose because you have make it an objection against one particular revelation that there be so many claim to revelation throughout the world alciphron reply with dig at the word inspire it come he rightly say from latin mean to breathe or blow in so it should be apply to mere wind or vapour and not to big truths euphranor sharply take this up point out that alciphron be will to say that he discourse while sit down and yet discourse come from latin mean run about alciphron defend his use of discourse in the obvious way and euphranor cash in on that may we not as well conceive that the term inspiration might be borrow from sensible things to stand for god action when in an extraordinary manner he influence arouse and enlighten the mind of prophet or an apostle let drop the silly point about blow in and get back to our real topic when we look into our own mind it seem to me we plainly perceive certain instincts impulses and tendencies that from time to time spring up unaccountably in our souls this be ordinary and natural but why can we conceive it possible for the human mind for an extraordinary reason to be move in an extraordinary manner have its faculties stir up and kick into action by supernatural power he admit that there have be and will be wild visions and morbid rave but that doesn mean that there aren also genuine inspirations we can rule out the possibility that true prophet or inspire person can distinguish divine inspiration from mentally unbalance imagination as easily as we can distinguish sleep from wake he quote the book of jeremiah to that effect see no need to deny that inspirations and revelations be possible make the best you can of this concession well if something be allow as possible we be entitle to suppose that it be fact we be let us then suppose that god choose to make revelation to men and that he inspire some men as mean to instruct others have suppose this can you deny that their inspire discourse and revelations might have be commit to write or that the write versions might in the course of time become obscure in many place that some of them might even have be less clear than others at the outset or that they might get alter by frequent transcribe as other write be know to have do isn it even very probable that all these things would happen grant it well then how can you defend your claim that the bible be not divine because of facts about it that you now acknowledge would probably accompany any divine revelation transmit down to us through so many centuries he concede the point about small blemish that might arise from copy errors etc but defy the wit of man to invent anything more extravagant than the account the bible give of apparitions devil miracles god manifest in the flesh be bear again grace self denial resurrection of the dead and such like sick dream things so odd unaccountable and remote from human understand that you have no more chance of clear them of the charge of absurdity than you have of make black man white by wash him no critical skill can justify them no tradition can recommend them even as inventions of competent men let alone as divine revelations always have great opinion of your wisdom alciphron but now consider you as something more than man how otherwise could you know what it may be proper for god to reveal this be of course sneer don think it be insult to the greatest of human understand to suppose that they be ignorant of many things that aren suit to their faculties or lie out of their reach even the plan of princes often lie beyond the ken of their subject who can only know what be reveal to them by those at the helm and be often unqualified to judge concern the usefulness and likely consequences even of what they be allow to know until in due course the scheme unfold and be explain by the course of events of course many things contain in the bible be remote from the common understand of mankind but don see that it follow from this that they didn come from divine revelation on the contrary doesn it seem reasonable to suppose that revelation from god would contain something different in kind or more excellent in degree than anything that lie within the grasp of humans even of the wisest philosopher account of separate spirit good or bad prophecies miracles etc be undoubtedly strange but don see how you can prove them to be impossible or absurd some things be so evidently absurd that it would be almost as silly to disprove them as to believe them and take these the ones list moment ago to be of that sort isn it possible that some men show as much prejudice and narrowness in reject all such account as others might show slackness and credulity in accept them can understand why anyone who admit the union of the soul with the body should declare it impossible for the human nature to be unite to the divine in some way that can be describe or grasp by reason nor can see any absurdity in the idea that sinful man may be bear again may become new creature by the grace of god reclaim him from carnal life to spiritual life of virtue and holiness and since be govern by sense and appetite be contrary to the happiness and perfection of rational creature don in the least wonder that we be tell to exercise self denial as for the resurrection of the dead don regard that as so very contrary to the analogy of nature when see plant that have be leave to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigour or worm that appear to be dead change its nature so that something that at first crawl on the earth become new species and fly around with wing and when consider that the soul and body be things of such utterly different kinds can see any reason to be positive that the soul must necessarily be extinguish when the body fall to piece especially since find in myself strong natural desire for immortality and haven observe that natural appetites be give in vain give merely to be frustrate you regard certain things as extravagant and absurd but shan agree with that until see good reason for it no alciphron your positive air mustn be regard as proof and we win think things be contrary to common sense just because you say so by common sense we ought to mean either the general sense of mankind or the improve reason of think men now believe that all those article you have so powerfully and vividly sum up and explode can be show to be consistent with and even in harmony with common sense in one or other of these sense that the gods might appear and converse among men and that the divinity might inhabit human nature be things that the heathens believe and though the notion of devil may not be so obvious or so fully describe there be plain trace of it in several traditions he cite ancient greeks chaldeans and egyptians and report that text as early as homer contain something that cardinal bessarion have identify as an allusion to the fall of satan then many more classical reference in connection with the other article on alciphron list apparently with grace uppermost though it isn mention by name wind up any man who really think have only to look at what other think men have think men who can be suppose to be prejudice in favour of reveal religion and he ll see cause if not to think with reverence of the christian doctrines of grace self denial rebirth sanctification and the rest at least to judge more modestly and cautiously than someone who confidently declare them absurd and in conflict with the reason of mankind lysicles say that none of this have the slightest appeal him and that if this make anyone think he be ignorant be happy and safe in my ignorance crito say perhaps not so safe which he and back up thus mere ignorance isn crime but willful ignorance deliberate ignorance ignorance from laziness or conceited ignorance be fault we have the testimony of heathen writers as proof of that and it doesn need proof to show that if ignorance be fault then we can be secure in ignorance as an excuse honest crito seem to hint that man should take care to inform himself while alive so that his neglect to do so win be punish when he be dead the best way to get gentleman to keep on with something be to try to frighten him out of it this be the stale and absurd tactic that priests use make them and their religion more odious and contemptible to me than all the other items put together that hell and eternal punishment thing be the most absurd as well as the nastiest think that ever enter into the head of mortal man but you must admit that it isn an exclusively christian absurdity because socrates that great free thinker of athens think it probable that impious men be punish for ever in hell it be report of this same socrates that he be often know to think for twenty four hours at stretch fix in the same position and wrap up in meditation our modern free thinkers be men of more lively sort those old philosophers be most of them insecure think they have narrow timid way of think that fall far short of the frank spirit of our time but if man doesn know the nature of the soul how can reason give him any assurance about whether it be mortal or immortal but what if do know the nature of the soul have be teach that whole secret by modern free thinker man of science who discover the nature of the soul not by tiresome look into himself or by get himself confuse in labyrinth of notions or by stupidly think for whole days and nights together but by look into things and observe the analogy of nature this great man be try and test scientist who have conduct many experiment on plant he hold that men and plant be really of the same species that animals be move plant and plant be fix animals that the mouth of animals have the same use as the root of plant that blossom and flower correspond to the private part of the human body that plant and animal body be both organic and both have life which be certain motion and circulation of juices through the appropriate tube or vessels the soul he say be the specific form or source from which come the distinct qualities or properties of things we start with plant because they be simpler than animals and thus easier to analyse the soul of any plant rosemary for example be nothing more or less than its essential oil this be the source of its special fragrance taste and medicinal virtues its life and operations use chemical techniques to separate or extract this essential oil and you get the soul of the plant what leave behind be dead carcass that doesn have single property or power of the plant this essential oil be an oily substance with fine subtle element or volatile salt imprison in it strictly speak this volatile salt be the essence of the plant soul contain all its power and the oil be the vehicle of this most subtle part of the soul the part that fix and individuate it and just as the plant die when separate from this oil so the soul die when this essential oil be split up into its elements as you can see by leave it expose for some time to the open air so that the volatile salt or spirit can fly off after which the oil remain dead and tasteless not perceptibly weigh any less but have lose that volatile essence of the soul that ethereal aura that spark of existence which return and mix with the solar light the universal soul of the world and the only source of life talk about all life of plant lower animals and think animals which differ only accord to the fineness of organization of their body this chemical system let you at once into the nature of the soul and account for all its phenomena in the compound that be call man the soul or essential oil be what commonly go by the name of animal spirit see note on page for chemists do now agree that animal spirit be nothing but the more subtle oil now in proportion as the essential oil of the plant we call man be more subtle than that of other plant the volatile salt that impregnate it be more free to act and that explain the properties and action of humans that distinguish them from lower creatures he give some examples lysicles your ingenious friend have open up new scene and explain the most obscure and difficult point in the clearest and easiest manner this account of things strike my fancy must admit no great lover of creeds or systems but when notion be reasonable and base on experience know how to value it really seriously lysicles do you believe this account to be true in the next exchange the artist and his art mean roughly the expert and the field in which he be an expert really seriously don know whether do or not but can assure you that the ingenious artist himself hasn the least doubt about it and believe an artist in his art be sound bite of advice and short way to knowledge but what do the soul of man have to do with the chemical art the same reason that tell me to trust skillful artist in his art incline me to suspect him when he be out of his art men be too apt to reduce unknown things to the standard of what they know and bring prejudice or slant from things they have be familiar with in make judgments about things with which they have not be familiar have know violinist solemnly teach that the soul be harmony geometrician very positive that the soul must be extend and physician who have pickle half dozen embryos and dissect few rat and frog become very sure of himself and affirm that there be no soul at all lysicles decline to argue say in effect there the theory take it or leave it which euphranor ironically describe as say like gentleman then he ask whether the maxim about believe an artist in his art apply to clergymen lysicles say no why not because he lysicles know as much about religious matter as the clergy do all men of good sense be competent judge of those matter what be god attribute and his treatment of mankind the true end and happiness of rational creatures and the mean of improve and perfect their be be these more easy and obvious matter than the ones to which ordinary secular study be devote perhaps not but do know this some things be so obviously absurd that no authority will make me give in to them for instance if all mankind try to convince me that the son of god be bear on earth in poor family be spat upon beat and crucify live like beggar and die like thief wouldn believe word of it common sense show everyone how an earthly prince or ambassador can decently appear and the son of god come as an ambassador from heaven must make an appearance that be much greater than that and be in all respect the very reverse of that which jesus christ be report even by his own historians to have make do you think lysicles that if man enter london in rich suit of clothe with hundred gild coach and thousand lace footmen this would be more divine and truly grand appearance than if he have power with word to heal all kinds of diseases to raise the dead to life and calm storm at sea oh sure it be very agreeable to common sense to suppose that he could restore others to life but couldn save his own you tell us of course that he rise again from the dead but what be the point of his die in the first place the just die for the unjust the son of god die for wicked men and why precisely there why exactly then why didn he appear earlier and preach in all part of the world so that the benefit be spread wider and more evenly account for all these point and reconcile them if you can to the common notions and plain sense of mankind crito reply with two point one be that some of lysicles question be boorish and ill mannered benevolent act aren usually scrutinize as carefully as other act who but minute philosopher would on gratuitous distribution of favour ask why now rather than earlier lysicles should face the fact that he be out of his depth none of us know nearly enough to be entitle to form judgments on what it would have be reasonable for god to do there be several page of this you can judge the part of machine without know how the whole thing work lysicles say that some things can be see at first glance to be so cruel and unjust that they be obviously unworthy of god to which crito reply that we should take into account à propos of how badly god treat the egyptians how badly the egyptians have treat the israelites and also repeat that caution in judgment be appropriate when we know that we don have all the facts euphranor have argument make the point that children often don understand and may even resent action by their parent that be entirely for their own good he liken this to lysicles attitude to action by god the topic of the ancients versus the free think moderns come up again in the course of it alciphron say that the present time gray and hoary with age and experience have manifest advantage over those that be falsely call ancient the point be that in ancient time the world be younger than it be now he continue tell you in plain english euphranor we don want your revelations for this plain reason those that be clear be already know to everyone and no one get any benefit from those that be obscure just as it impossible for anyone to believe the practical principles of the christian religion and not be the better for them so it be obvious that those principles may be much more easily teach as article of faith than demonstrate or discover as doctrines of science here high grade theoretical knowledge we see all the time that many be instruct in matter of faith few be teach by scientific demonstration and fewer still can discover truth for themselves wish that minute philosophers would reflect on some facts relate to the natural or civil concern of the world with religion not come into it namely how rarely men be sway or govern by mere reason and how often by faith how little they know and how much they believe how uncommon it be to meet with man who argue soundly who really be master of reason or walk by that rule how much better qualify men be to judge concern facts than concern reason to receive truth on testimony than to deduce it from principles how general spirit of trust or reliance run through the whole system of life and opinion and at the same time how seldom the dry light of unprejudiced nature be follow or to be find if our think men would only give think to these things they might find it hard to produce good reason why faith which have so great share in everything else should have no place in religion re dry light see note on page he then reply to the be already know to everyone part of what alciphron have just say by say that obviously they weren perhaps they could have be know but revelation be useful if it reveal something that men haven take the trouble to know even if they could have know it alciphron then move to complaint against prophecies namely that they be very obscure euphranor reply that some be obscure while some be not which be pretty much what should be expect give the way the world be and the way men be alciphron in reply refer to the scepticism about prophecies of free think experts on these matter and euphranor respond to that somewhat sneeringly and remark that the christians have their experts too after further exchange of insult euphranor offer some explanations of why certain prophecies be unclear to us at this time look back in time we can see certain progress from darker to lighter in religious matter so we can reasonably expect that future events will clear up such point as at present exercise the faith of believers alciphron now drop prophecies and turn to something else want now to examine your religion by compare the system of revelation with collateral account of ancient heathen writers and show how much it clash with them the christian revelation presuppose the jewish religion so if the jewish one be destroy the christian one must of course fall to the grind with it be go to go the short way by attack this jewish revelation head on tell me if we believe the mosaic account of things the first five book of the old testament don we have to hold that the world be create not quite six thousand years ago yes we do what will you say now if other ancient record carry the history of the world back many thousand years beyond this period what if the egyptians and chinese have account extend to thirty or forty thousand years what if the egyptians have observe twelve hundred eclipse during the space of forty eight thousand years what if the chinese have also many observations antecedent to the jewish account of the creation what if the chaldeans have be observe the star for more than four hundred thousand years and what shall we say if we have successions of kings and their reign mark for several thousand years before the begin of the world assign by moses shall we reject the account and record of all other nations the most famous ancient and learn in the world and preserve blind reverence for moses the legislator of the jews if they deserve to be reject euphranor reply why shouldn we reject them this introduce an attack on the account and record that alciphron have mention the only reliable ones don go as far back as moses time for the begin of the world the writers of the record that stretch further back be unknown or unregarded by ancient astronomers modern scholars have uncover inconsistencies in the chinese account alciphron remark that the modern scholars in question be mostly roman catholic missionaries and euphranor reply that they be our only source of information about the chinese and that in any case it make sense to trust them the same persons who tell us of these account refute them if we reject their authority in one case what right have we to build upon it in another alciphron praise the chinese generally as learn able and acute people who be addict to arts and sciences euphranor reply at length that on the contrary the chinese be superstitious credulous and absurd then he turn to the egyptian record purport to make the world older than moses do and get alciphron to admit that he doesn know where those record be find when they be write how they be preserve and so on they aren mention by any ancient greek writers though some of them visit egypt euphranor comment again at even greater length on the credulity of any modern person like alciphron who believe such stuff alciphron reply with challenge how can you account for the work that the great joseph scaliger and sir john marsham have put in on those record euphranor decline to account for it and deplore the fact that such substantial scholars as scaliger and marsham should waste time on that rubbishy stuff after all it hard to see why those egyptian priests should have set up spurious record support such great claim to antiquity record that differ one from another but be alike in one thing namely that they overthrow moses history how can this be account for if there be no real foundation for the record what pleasure profit or power could motivate men to forge successions of ancient name and periods of time for age before the world begin really alciphron be there anything so strange or unprecedented in this empty wish to extend the antiquity of nations beyond the truth hasn it be see in most part of the world doesn it appear even in our own time especially among dependent and subdue people who have little else to boast of he then launch into mass of detail first about the irish and then about the sicilians these be dependent and subdue people who invent long histories for themselves as way of feel important then why isn it likely that the egyptians subdue people invent fabulous account from the same motive and like others value themselves because of extravagant claim to antiquity when in all other respect they be so much inferior to their master and it be no less certain that the phœnicians assyrians and chaldeans be each conquer and reduce people before the rest of the world appear to have hear anything of their claim to such remote antiquity but what need be there to work at account for the motivations of fabulous writers isn it sufficient to see that they relate absurdities aren support by any independent evidence seem not to have be believe even by their own countrymen and be inconsistent one with another there nothing strange in the fact that men should have the stupidity to create false account so as to deceive the world what be strange be the fact that after so many learn critics have do so much towards undeceive the world there should still be men who be capable of be take in by the paltry scrap of fabulous or counterfeit writers let me point out that those learn critics may prove to be clergymen perhaps some of them roman catholics what about sir isaac newton be he either catholic or clergyman you may not grant that he be as wise and intellectually powerful as the great men of the minute philosophy but it you can deny that he have read and think great deal on this subject end his inquiry with perfect contempt for all those celebrate rival to moses it have be observe by able men that sir isaac newton though layman be deeply prejudice as we can from his great regard for the bible and the same hold for mr locke mr boyle lord bacon and other famous laymen who however knowledgeable on some matter can be think to have achieve the keen discernment that be the special distinction of your sect but perhaps there be reason other than prejudice to incline man to give moses the preference the government manners and religion of his country be base on the truth of his history there be clear trace of that history in the most ancient book and traditions of the gentiles particularly of the brahmins and parse his account of the great flood be confirm by sign in nature as well as by write of antiquity his history be confirm by the relatively recent invention of arts and sciences the gradual people of the world the very name of ancient nations and even by the authority and arguments of that renowned philosopher lucretius who be so much admire and follow by the free thinkers when he write on other subject the continual decrease of fluids the sink of hill and the slow of planetary motion provide natural evidence that this world have begin just as the civil or historical proof that have mention plainly indicate that this begin occur at about the time assign to it in the bible and after all that let me add one more remark people dig into the earth have find quantities of shell and in some place bone and horn of animals complete and unbroken that have probably lie there for thousands of years that make it seem probable that gems medals and metal or stone implement might have remain bury complete and unbroken for forty or fifty thousand years if the world have be that old so how do it come about that no such remain be find no remnants of all those centuries precede the biblical account of time no fragment of build no public monuments no intaglios cameos statues reliefs medals inscriptions utensils or manufacture things of any kind be ever discover to testify to the existence of those mighty empires those successions of monarchs heroes and demi gods for so many thousand years let us look forward in time and think about time twenty thousand years into the future with the intervene time have involve plague famines war and earthquakes all of which will have make great havoc in the world isn it highly probable that pillars vases and statues that now exist would still exist at that future time and testify to our time and all the time between now and then think of pillars etc make of granite porphyry or jasper stone that be so hard that we know them to have last for two thousand years above grind without any considerable alteration isn it also probable that some of our current coin might be dig up at that time far in the future or that old wall and the foundations of build might show themselves just as the shell and stone of the primeval world be preserve down to our time these be matter that anyone can form judgment about use common sense and ordinary experience they give us good reason to conclude that the world be create at about the time record in the bible alciphron sit muse and make no answer whereupon lysicles speak up hark back to crito remark that lucretius support the mosaic date of the start of the world must admit that would rather suppose with lucretius that the world be make by chance and that men grow out of the earth like pumpkins than pin my faith on those wretched fable spin fragment of oriental history that alciphron have use as evidence against moses date of the start of that world as for the learn men who have take pain to clarify them and piece them together they strike me as be no better than so many musty pedants an able free thinker may now and then make some use of their laborious output and play off one absurdity against another an egyptian absurdity against jewish one but don infer from this that he have any real respect for the authority of such apocryphal writers or believe one syllable of the chinese babylonian or egyptian traditions if we seem to give them preference over the bible that only because they be not establish by law this be my plain sense of the matter and dare say it the general sense of our sect they be too rational to take such trifle seriously though they sometimes give hint of deep learn and put on grave face just to have fun at the expense of bigots since lysicles will have it so be content not to build on account of time precede the mosaic he then talk about historians of about moses own time they should be regard as on par with moses he say and some of them give account that utterly clash with his one that say that the jews be really egyptians who have leprosy and be drive out of the country for that reason on this account the religion that they say have be give to them on mount sinai be really something which they as egyptians bring with them from egypt crito reply that those other account aren evidence against the mosaic one because they be in such conflict with one another and that linguistic considerations show that the jews weren egyptians and that religion whose fundamental principle be monotheism and whose principal design be to abolish idolatry couldn have come from egypt the most idolatrous of all nations after some more of this alciphron deplore the loss of the book of those great men celsus porphyry and julian book that would have enable the modern free thinkers to demolish the whole jewish religious system at once crito question that and say some slight things about each of the three especially emphasize how credulous they be accept all sort of weird beliefs they be he conclude whimsical superstitious weak and visionary and he throw in final gibe against the impartial gentlemen who admire the talents and be proud to tread in the footsteps of those three men see things in different light something that one person wonder at be regard as negligible by another it can even happen that prejudice mind whose attention be turn towards things fault and blemish fancy it see some shadow of defect in the great light that have in our own days enlighten the world but tell me crito what you think of the jewish historian josephus he be agree to have be man of learn and judgment he do himself accept reveal religion namely judaism and christians commonly cite him with respect when his authority suit their purpose all this accept then mustn it seem suspicious to any impartial inquirer that this learn jew should write the history of his own country focus on the very place and time of jesus christ appearance without say anything about the character miracles and doctrine of that extraordinary person some ancient christians be so sensitive about this that they try to repair the situation by insert famous passage in the work of that historian forgery that have be sufficiently detect by able modern critics well there be expert opinion on both side of that question but don want to get into all that so be content to take it your way by suppose that the passage be not genuine but be the pious fraud of some wrong head christian who couldn tolerate the omission in josephus but that fraud can make the omission real objection against christianity and can see in the omission any other basis for amazement or suspicion suppose the gospel account to have exactly true it would seem very natural for josephus not to have report it give that he be aim by his work to give his country some stand in the eye of the world which have be greatly prejudice against the jews and know little of their history purpose that the life and death of our saviour wouldn have contribute to even slightly josephus couldn have be an eye witness of our saviour or his miracles he be high class pharisee who be learn in foreign as well as jewish scholarship with high position in the state whereas the gospel be preach to the poor the gospel be initially accept and then spread by poor illiterate people choose for this role so that the gospels spread wouldn seem to be the work of man or product of human self interest or power the jews generally expect the messiah to be worldly and conquer prince prejudice that be so strong that they prefer attribute our saviour miracles to the devil to acknowledge him to be the messiah at josephus time the jewish state be in condition of hellish disorder and confusion with men mind fill and stun by unparalleled war dissensions massacre and seditions of that devote people take all these facts together don find it strange that such man who be write with that view at that time and in those circumstances should omit to describe our bless saviour life and death or to mention his miracles or to pay any attention to the state of the christian church which at that time be like tiny seed just begin to take root and germinate and this will seem even less strange if you bear in mind that the apostles in few years after our saviour death leave jerusalem set about convert non jews and be disperse throughout the world the convert in jerusalem be not only some of the poorest people but be also few in number the three thousand convert add to the church in one day when peter preach in jerusalem seem to have be strangers from all over the country who have gather there to celebrate the feast of pentecost throughout the time of josephus and for several years more during succession of fifteen bishops the christians at jerusalem conform to the laws of moses which make them in outward appearance just like the rest of the jews which must have make them harder to notice the gospel when first propagate seem to ignore the great or considerable men of this world would it be surprise if they in turn overlook it as something not suit to their way of think he go on to say that learn jews at that time might well be afraid in one way of write in favour of christianity and in another way of write against it so that their safest course be to say nothing about it also the historian gamaliel do mention jesus christ in pass in his account of st jam death although he show respect for the apostle he mention jesus in casual and neutral way say nothing either good or bad about him but he characterize him as jesus who be call the christ not who claim to be the christ or who be falsely call the christ but simply and then he say it again this time in greek he continue it be evident that josephus know there be such man as jesus and that he be say to be the christ and yet he condemn neither him nor his followers which see as evidence in their favour if josephus have know or be convince that jesus be an impostor of course he would have say so plainly can understand why any man should conclude against the truth of the gospel from josephus omit to speak of it any more than from his omit to accept it if the first christians be chief priests and rulers or men of science and learn it might have be more plausible to contend that their religion be human construct than it be in fact give that it have please god to use weak things to confound the strong yet it seem an odd argument in support of any doctrine that it be preach by simple people to simple people it would indeed be very weak argument if the only testimony to the doctrine come from simple people but what we have here be doctrine of which this be true its first instrument be people with very few human advantage it make its first progress among people who didn have wealth skills or power to grace or encourage it in short time through its own innate excellence and the mighty force of miracles and the demonstration of the holy spirit it spread throughout the world and subdue men of all rank and condition of life do this not only with no support from all worldly motives but positively against such motives isn it very unreasonable to reject or suspect such doctrine on the ground that its human mean be lowly mightn this with much better reason be think to be evidence that the doctrine come from god alciphron reply that real inquirers will demand testimony from learn men there have be plenty of that but their testimony be suspect because they be prejudice christians and therefore their testimony be to be suspect you be demand evidence of the truth of christianity from people who didn believe it this isn reasonable they kick this topic around for while and then dispute start up concern how much respect the early church father deserve alciphron say that even if he do give weight to early christian write the great number of forgeries and heresies that spring up in those time would considerably take away from that weight let us suppose something that you do agree to be possible namely that there be god devil and revelation from heaven that be commit to write many centuries ago on the basis of that supposition take look at human nature and ask what would probably follow if the supposition be fact isn it very likely there would be half believers mistake bigots holy frauds men who be ambitious self interest dispute conceited schismatic heretical absurd among those who announce themselves as believers in this reveal religion and isn it also very likely that after few centuries there would be various read omissions transpositions and obscurities in the text of the sacred oracles you be the judge be it reasonable to treat as an objection to something course of events that would probably and naturally follow if the thing in question do exist well say what you will this variety of opinions must shake the faith of reasonable man where there be so many different opinions on the same point it very certain that they can all be true but it certain that they can all be false and the mean we have to use to find out the truth when man of sense embark on this inquiry he find himself suddenly startle and throw off balance by hard word and knotty question this make him abandon the pursuit think the game not worth the chase crito reply that differences of opinion and the formation of sects occur in all branch of human study he cite law medicine and politics and this doesn deter us from think that there be good rule sound ideas and useful truths in all those discipline he develop this approach in connection with medicine remark that real discoveries have be make despite the hard word and knotty question that have arise on the way to them then after brief exchange of insult crito turn to the question of schisms and sub sects but to return what profession of men be there who never split into schisms and never talk nonsense isn it obvious that out of all the kinds of knowledge on which the human mind be employ there grow certain excrescences that can safely be par off as we pare our finger nail under all that rubbishy stuff it be certain that the faith derive from christ and his apostles be not piece of empty sophistry and to claim to demolish the foundation of faith for the sake of the superstructure that humans have build be sign of poor think and it sign of unfairness to suppose that doubtful sense be fix and argue from one side of the question in dispute point such question as should the begin of genesis be understand in literal or an allegorical sense be the book of job history or parable be dispute amongst christians so an unbeliever have no right to argue from one side of any of them what we be argue for now be not this or that tenet of sect this or that controversial idea but rather the general faith teach by christ and his apostles and preserve by universal and perpetual tradition in all the church down to our own time to attack this divine doctrine on account of things that come not from within the doctrine but from external source such as the theories and dispute of men strike me as an absurdity comparable with cut down fine tree that provide fruit and shade because its leave give nourishment to caterpillars or because spiders sometimes weave cobwebs among the branch after an exchange focus on the question of how clever men ought to spend their time but after all the examination and inquiry that mortal man can make about reveal religion it be impossible to reach any rational sure foot we be tell strange things that be say to be prove by the fact that men have lay down their live for them but it be perfectly conceivable indeed it have often happen that men have die for the sake of false beliefs that they use to hold you may indeed find examples of men die for falsehoods that they believe but can you find case of man die for the sake of proposition that he didn believe of course not it be inconceivable yet this must be what happen if the witness of christ miracles and resurrection be impostors there be indeed great deal of glittery talk about faith base on miracles but when examine this matter thoroughly and track the christian faith back to its origins find that it be really base on darkness and hesitation and uncertainty instead of proposition that be evident or at least agreeable to human reason find an astonish narrative of the son of god tempt in the wilderness by the devil something utterly unexplainable have absolutely no purpose or use or reason meet with strange stories of angels appear voice from heaven demons things quite out of line with common sense and common experience along with number of incredible feats say to have be do by divine power but more probably the inventions of men and not make less likely to be so by my complete inability to guess why they be invent deeply lay plan be dark and the less we know the more we suspect but even if all those stories be true shan accept that they be miraculous until have thorough knowledge of ordinary natural cause and of the force of magic it seem to me alciphron that what you be analyse be not faith but infidelity lack of faith and that you be trace it back to its source which judge from your own account understand to be dark and doubtful worry and surmise hastiness in judge and narrowness in think and all this be base on your fantastic over rat of your own scrap of experience and on real ignorance of the view of god and of the qualities operations and inter relations of the many fundamentally different kinds of be that exist in the universe or that you don know don exist that what the source of unbelief be like obscure uncertain fanciful and conjectural whereas the source of faith be proposition that seem to me plain and clear there be nothing unclear about these this faith in christ be spread throughout the world soon after his death that wasn bring about by human learn politics or power in the church early years many knowledgeable and honest men accept this faith not from some but against all worldly motives the nearer those men be to the fountain head of christianity the better chance they have to check on the truth of the proposition that they believe the less it be in their self interest to be persuade the more need there be for evidence to convince them they rely on the authority of people who declare themselves eye witness of the miracles and resurrection of christ those profess eye witness suffer greatly through give this testimony and finally they seal it with their blood those witness weak and unimportant as they be overcome the world spread more light preach purer morals and do more benefit to mankind than all the philosophers and wise men put together if these proposition be clear and sure as they seem to me to be they constitute plain just and reasonable ground for assent to the christian faith they don rest on any falsehoods they don contain anything beyond our sphere because they don presuppose more knowledge than we have or better faculties than we be actually equip with and even if they aren accept as morally certain as think they will be by fair and unprejudiced inquirers even accept them as only probable be sufficient to stop the mouth of an unbeliever morally certain mean certain enough for all practical purpose it bite vague but be stronger than only probable the pillars of our faith be the above eight plain proposition and not the obscure ones that you suppose which be in fact the unsound uncertain source of unbelief in rash prejudice and assume mind to argue or counter argue on the basis that suppose miracle might be explain by hide power of nature or by magic be grope in the dark but by the evident light of their sense men can be sure enough about perceptible effect and matter of fact such as the miracles and the resurrection of christ and the testimony of such men can be pass on through centuries with the same moral certainty as can other historical narrations and those same miraculous facts when reason have relate them to the doctrines they be bring to prove provide an unbiased mind with strong indications that they have come from god or from superior source as for the fact that jews and gentiles back then attribute our saviour miracles to magic do you count that as evidence against the miracles it seem to be to be positive evidence that those events do occur it doesn square with the christian account of what cause them but it doesn bring any evidence against that account as for the nature and operations of demons the history laws and system of rational be and god scheme or view we don claim to know enough about all this to account for every action and appearance record in the gospel but you don know enough of those things to be entitle to object against account that be so well support by testimony it easy to raise doubt regard many authentic part of civil history events that we find inexplicable because the explanation of them require more knowledge than we have of facts circumstances and councils and it even easier with respect to natural history in that field if surmise be accept as evidence against things that be odd strange and inexplicable if our slight experience be make the rule and measure of truth and no phenomenon be accept unless we with our ignorance of the principles laws and system of nature could explain it we would make discoveries all right discoveries about our own blindness and presumption something that can begin to explain by any rule of logic and good sense be why men who be so easily and so often floor by problems about the natural visible world should yet be so sharp sight and dogmatic about the invisible world and its mysteries expect that ll always be in the dark as you put it about the evidence for the christian religion and always presume there isn any for how be it possible at this remote distance in time to arrive at any knowledge or conduct any demonstrations about it what of it admit that knowledge in strict sense can be have except of something that be either self evident or demonstrate but probable arguments be sufficient basis for faith who ever think that rigorous proof be necessary to make christian all that be need be faith and provide that men be convince in the main and on the whole this save faith can be consistent with some degrees of obscurity doubt and error for although the light of truth be unchangeable in its eternal source the father of light in relation to us it be variously weaken and obscure by pass across long distance or through thick medium in which it be intercept distort or tint by men prejudice and passions but despite all this if you will use your eye you can see enough for the purpose either of nature or of grace although the light you see by be dimmer or brighter depend on the place the distance the time of day and the medium and although there may be much that we can explain in the realms of nature and of grace all that be require for faith to be maintain be that the two should exhibit enough analogy to make it probable that they have the same author be the workmanship of one and the same hand those who saw touch and handle jesus christ after his resurrection if anyone do may be say to have see by clear light but to us the light be very dim and yet we be expect to believe in the resurrection just as they do for my part agree with spinoza that christ death be literal but his resurrection be allegorical and for my part can see anything in this celebrate unbeliever that should make me desert matter of fact and moral evidence so as to adopt his ideas throughout this paragraph evidence mean evidentness in this usage the evidence of proposition refer to how evident be it not about evidence for so matter of fact and moral evidence mean matter of fact and proposition that be morally evident re morally see the note on page do have to allow certain allegorical resurrection mean the resurrection of christ disciples from weakness to resolution from fear to courage from despair to hope and that allegorical resurrection be evidence for the real one because can see how those change in the disciples can be explain except by suppose that they know through their own sense that our lord have truly really literally rise from the dead it can be deny that his disciples who be eye witness of his miracles and resurrection have stronger evidence than we can have of those matter but it also can be deny that at that time there be correspondingly greater need for evidence to induce men to embrace new institution that be contrary to the whole system of their upbringing their prejudice their passions their interest and every human motive still it seem to me that the moral evidence and probable arguments that be within our reach be quite enough to make prudent think men keep to the faith that have be hand down to us from our ancestors and establish by the laws of our country faith require submission on matter that be above our knowledge and for the rest recommend doctrines that best fit our interest and our reason he go on to talk about the advantage that we have of be able to look back at the history of the world during the christian period and see god plan work in it then we can behold christ crucify that stumble block to the jews and foolishness to the greeks put an end to the temple worship of the one and the idolatry of the other but we preach christ crucify unto the jews stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness corinthians if due reflection on these things isn enough to create reverence for the christian faith in the mind of men why would that be because men have wise and cautious incredulity anything but that consider how easily men have faith during their daily do where there be no prejudice or appetite to bias or disturb their natural judgment the men who in matter of religion win move an inch unless things be make evident to them and at every turn expect demonstration trust their health to physician and their live to sailor with complete faith can think they deserve the honour of be think harder to convince than other men or that they be more accustom to know and therefore less incline to believe on the contrary it tempt to suspect that our modern unbelief owe more to ignorance than to knowledge this lead to squabble with lysicles about attitudes to careful scholarship and then about the legitimacy of attack christianity by joke and pun and innuendo euphranor join in on that last topic and so finally do although be declare admirer of reason worshipper of reason have to admit that in some case the sharpness of ridicule can do more than the strength of argument but if free thinkers sometimes use mirth and humour it not because we have no other weapons it shall never be say that free thinker be afraid of reason no crito we have reason in store the best be yet to come and if we can find an hour for another conversation before lysicles and set out for london tomorrow morning ll undertake to supply you with reason that be as clear effective and close to the point as you could wish seventh dialogue tuesday we assemble at break of day in the library alciphron begin with declaration of his sincerity assure us he have very maturely and with most unbiased mind consider everything that have be say the day before he add that number of probable reason have be give for accept the christian faith but he say because those reason be only probable they can overcome absolute certainty and demonstration so if can demonstrate rigorously prove that your religion be absurd and inconsistent your probable arguments in defence of it instantly lose their force and with it all right to be answer or consider when sincere and able witness give the same testimony that certainly have great weight in human affairs it can even have enough weight to claim our acceptance of things that be odd and out of line with human judgment and or experience will also concede that it be possible for tradition chain of testimonies to be convey with moral evidence see note on page through many centuries but you must concede that something that demonstrably and obviously false shouldn be accept on the strength of any testimony whatever because however good testimony be it can amount to demonstration to be plain no testimony can turn nonsense into sense no moral evidence can make contradictions consistent well then because the strength of our cause doesn depend on critical point of history chronology or languages it can be decide by any such point don be surprise if the same kind of tradition that govern our assent with respect to facts in civil or natural history be not accept as sufficient support for metaphysical absurdities and absolute impossibilities things that be obscure and unaccountable in human affairs or the operations of nature may nevertheless be possible and if the testimony to them be good enough they may be assent to but religious assent or faith can be plainly show to be intrinsically impracticable impossible and absurd this be the primary reason for unbelief this be our citadel and fortress it may indeed be ornament with extra turrets and supplementary wall of learnedness of various sort but if those be demolish the fortress still stand its own strength make it impregnable well have to admit that this shrink our field of inquiry considerably if you make good on what you have just say ll have nothing more to say it be easy to fool the shallow mind of the vulgar because it attend only to the surface of things and think about them not in detail but en bloc and so we find blind reverence for religious faith and mystery but when sharp philosopher come to dissect and analyse these items of faith the deceit plainly appear and because he isn blind he have no reverence for empty notions or more accurately for mere form of speech that mean nothing and be of no use to mankind the long speech that follow involve theory of mean and understand that be widely accept at the time its principal source be the third book of locke essay concern human understand word be sign they stand for ideas or they ought to and so far as they suggest ideas they be significant word that don suggest any ideas be insignificant someone who associate clear idea with each word that he use speak sense and when such ideas be lack the speaker utter nonsense so if we want to know whether someone speech be senseless and insignificant all we need do be to set aside the word and consider the ideas suggest by them because men can immediately communicate their ideas to one another they have to use sensible sign or word the purpose of which be to raise in the hearer mind the ideas that be already be in the speaker and if they fail to do this they be useless for someone to count as understand what he read or hear he must have sequence of ideas raise in his mind correspond to the sequence of word that he have read or hear these be plain truths that men readily assent to in theory but they aren much attend to in practice so they deserve to be expound in detail and drum into people however obvious and undeniable they may be people in general don much like think but they don mind speak and listen to the speech of others and the effect of that be that their mind be store with name rather than ideas the husk of knowledge rather than knowledge itself and yet these word without mean be often what mark off one party or sect or group of partisans from another form the subject matter of their dispute and the object of their zeal this be the most general cause of error and it isn restrict to ordinary mind even people who be regard as acute and learn philosophers be often busy work at name instead of things or ideas and be think to be express knowledge when really they be only utter hard word without mean knowledge be the perception of the connection or disagreement between ideas and someone who doesn distinctly perceive the ideas associate with the term can form mental proposition correspond to the verbal one so obviously that person can possibly have knowledge he can even be say to have opinion or faith these imply weaker assent than knowledge do but it still have to be assent to proposition and although the agreement or disagreement of the ideas win be as evident as in the case of knowledge the term of the verbal proposition have to be understand just as clearly as they be in knowledge which mean that the conventionally associate ideas must be clearly in the person mind ll say it again all degrees of assent whether base on reason or authority and wherever they be on the spectrum from be compel to believe this at one end to be faintly more incline to accept this than to deny it at the other be internal act of the mind that be direct at ideas without which there really can be any such thing as knowledge faith or opinion we can perhaps raise dust by argue with one another about purely verbal proposition but that be mere trifle all this will be readily agree to with respect to human learn and science here abstract theoretically organise and deductively interlock body of knowledge because in that domain it be generally accept method of expose any doctrine or thesis to strip off its word and examine what ideas if any be underneath this be often find to be the shortest way to end dispute which might otherwise grow and multiply without end with the disputants not understand one another or themselves needn give examples this doctrine about mean and understand shin by its own light and be accept by all think men what shall do be to apply the doctrine to our present topic hope don need to argue that the rule of reason and good sense that hold sway in all other subject ought to be apply in religion also well there be those who consider faith and reason to be two distinct domains and want us to think that good sense have nothing to do with the domain of faith which be in fact the region where it have most to do have decide never to argue with such men but leave them peacefully in possession of their prejudice in apply what have say about ideas and understand to issue in religion shan single out any nit pick dispute in academic theology nor shall pick on any doctrines concern the nature and essence of god because you might counter what say about any of those by claim that god be infinite and that the problem have raise be part of our general difficulty in grasp the nature of infinity the central item in the christian dispensation be grace nothing be mention or consider more often than grace be throughout the new testament which represent it as something of very special kind distinct from anything reveal to the jews or know by the light of nature this same grace be speak of as the gift of god as come through jesus christ as reign as abound as operate men be say to speak through grace and to believe through grace mention be make of the glory of grace the riches of grace the stewards of grace christians be say to be heirs of grace to receive grace grow in grace be strong in grace to stand in grace and to fall from grace and lastly grace be say to justify and to save them hence christianity be style the covenant or dispensation of grace mean that christianity rest on promise that god have make through grace and favour that he have give through grace and it well know that no point have create more controversy in the church than this doctrine of grace there have be many dispute about the nature extent and effect of grace and about the kinds of grace universal efficacious sufficient prevent and irresistible that have employ the pen of protestant as well as roman catholic theologians and he reel off the name of several christian sects not even slightly interest in just what these dispute have be so shan try to list them now all need to make my point be that great contest on these point have exist and still continue what would like to be tell be the answer to this what be the clear and distinct idea associate with the word grace presumably one can know the bare mean of term without go into the depth of all those learn inquiries and controversies this be surely an easy matter provide there be an idea connect to the term and if there isn it can be subject of rational dispute or an object of real faith of course men may indeed deceive themselves or others by claim to argue and believe when basically there be no argument or belief that go beyond mere verbal trifle can easily understand grace in one of its everyday non religious sense grace mean beauty blush womanly grace and grace mean favour the sign of grace that the queen show to raleigh but when grace name an active vital rule principle roughly source of energy or activity see in euphranor speech on page influence and operate on the mind of man and distinct from every natural power or motive declare that can understand it or form any distinct idea of it and therefore can assent to any proposition about it and so can have any faith regard it and it self evident truth that god doesn require anyone to do what he can do when alciphron talk of word as signify distinct idea he may mean that the idea be intrinsically clear or that the idea be distinct from all ideas associate with other word or both in this version distinct will be allow to stand unexplained philosophical friend of mine ask me to look at the write of some theologians that he show me which do and also talk with others on this subject but after all my read and conversations could make nothing of it whenever set aside the word grace and look into my own mind find complete absence of ideas and because suspect that men mind and abilities be much alike suspect that other men if they examine what they call grace with the same exactness and lack of bias would agree with me that there be nothing to it but an empty name this isn the only example of meaningless word that be often hear and speak but be believe to be intelligible simply because it be familiar there be many others that occur in sentence that be say to express necessary article of faith the fraud that grace impose on mankind be think partly the follow men speak of this holy principle as of something that act move and make things happen take their ideas from physical things from motion and the force or momentum of body because body be obvious and perceptible men put them in place of grace spiritual and incomprehensible thing that be clearly delusion even if our idea of bodily force be ever so clear and intelligible it doesn follow that the idea of grace suppose force but one that have nothing bodily about it must be clear and intelligible too and though we can reason clearly perceive assent and form opinions about bodily force it doesn at all follow that we can do the same regard grace and so it come about that clear sense base idea of something real produce or rather be make pretence for an imaginary spiritual faith that isn actually about anything call the faith imaginary because it isn possible for it to be real where there be no ideas there can be any assent and where there be no assent there can be any faith and if something be impossible no man can be oblige to have it or do it that as clear as anything in euclid whatever it be that word be use for can believe that they be use to do impossible things so let us look into what they be use for and see if we can make sense of our daily practice word it be agree be sign so it might be as well to examine the use of other sign so as to understand the use of word counter at card table be use not for their own sake but only as sign substitute for money as word be substitute for ideas tell me alciphron be it necessary every time these counter be use throughout the game to form an idea of the precise amount of money that each represent by no mean all that need be that the players agree on their respective value at the outset and cash them in at those value when the game be over and in add up some number where the figure stand for pound shill and pence do you think it necessary to form ideas of pound shill and pence at each step in the operation don all that be require be for the figure on the bottom line to direct our action appropriately with respect to things it seem to follow from this that word can be significant even if they don every time they be use arouse in our mind the ideas that they signify because it enough for meaningfulness if we have it in our power to substitute things or ideas for the word when there be call for it it seem to follow also that word have use additional to that of mark and suggest distinct ideas namely influence our behaviour and there be two ways for them to do that form rule for us to act by and arouse certain passions dispositions and emotions in our mind so it seem that discourse that tell us how to act or spur the do or not do of an action can be useful and significant even if the word make it up don each bring distinct idea into our mind it seem so tell me alciphron isn an idea altogether inactive it be so an agent something that do things an active mind or spirit can be an idea and can be like an idea from which it would seem to follow that the word that stand for an active principle soul or spirit don stand for ideas in the strict and proper sense of ideas but they aren insignificant or meaningless as can show through one really strike example namely the word or the word myself as use by me understand what it signify know what it mean but what it signify isn an idea and isn like an idea rather it be something that think and will and grasp ideas and do things with them it can be deny that we know what be mean by the term myself will memory love hate and so forth we have some notion that we understand relate to them even though strictly speak these word don suggest distinct ideas to us in this version of the seventh dialogue the use of idea and notion will exactly track berkeley what would you infer from this what have infer already namely that word can be significant without stand for ideas it because people think otherwise that the doctrine of abstract ideas have arise do you deny that the mind can abstract don deny that it can abstract in certain sense of that word we can think about one thing separately from another if but only if they could exist separately and could be perceive separately so we can abstract by think about man head and not about his body or think about colour without think about motion or think about shape without think about weight but it doesn follow from this that the mind can frame abstract general ideas think about colour without think about any specific hue which appear to be impossible yet it be generally think these days that every noun replace substantive name here and throughout mark out and exhibit to the mind one distinct idea separate from all others tell me alciphron isn the word number noun it be well now see if you can form an idea of number in abstract not bring verbal sign or things that be number speak for myself can can it be so difficult to form simple idea of number which be the subject matter of most evident demonstrable science wait bite let me see if can abstract the idea of number from number word and numerals and from all particular countable things long pause to tell the truth don find that can apparently then neither you nor can form distinct simple ideas of number and yet we can make very proper and significant use of number word and numerals they direct us in the management of our affairs and do it in such an essential way that we would be lose without them and yet if other men abilities be like mine achieve precise simple abstract idea of number be as difficult as be comprehend any mystery in religion to come now to your example let us examine what idea we can form of force abstract from body motion and outward perceptible effect speak again for myself don find that have or can have any such idea surely everyone know what be mean by force and yet question whether everyone can form distinct idea of force beg you alciphron don be distract by word set aside the word force and exclude everything else from your thoughts and then see what precise idea you have of force force be that in body which produce motion and other perceptible effect it be then something distinct from those effect it be well then please now set aside any think of the thing that have the force and the effect that follow from it and contemplate force itself through its own precise idea have to say that find it difficult shut your eye to assist your meditation alciphron close his eye and think for few minutes and then declare that he couldn do it well then reply euphranor there be something that it seem neither you nor can form an idea of and your own remark that men mind and abilities be much alike imply that no one else have any more of an idea of it than we do it do and yet there be certainly many speculations reason and dispute refine subtleties and intricate distinctions relate to this same force and to explain its nature and mark out the different notions of it or kinds of it learn men have use the term gravity reaction inertial force inherent force immediate force dead force live force momentum solicitatio conatus and various other such expressions and big controversies have arise about the notions or definitions of these term men have want to know whether force be spiritual or bodily whether it remain after action how it be transfer from one body to another strange paradoxes have be concoct about its nature properties and proportion for instance that opposite force can exist at the same time in the same quiescent body that the force of percussion in small particle be infinite he name book in which detail can be find and go on at some length about controversies between leibniz and others over force in physics then the ingenious toricelli say concern the momentum and the velocity of heavy fall body that they be certain something and an don know what what do all this tell us about the idea of force just force itself set aside body time space motion and all the perceptible measure of force can we say that it as difficult to form an idea of force as to form an idea of grace don know what to think about that but presume you ll agree that some proposition or theorems relate to force be obviously true and also useful for instance what berkeley write that body with conjunct force describe the diagonal of parallelogram in the same time that it would the side with separate what he ought to have mean if body be subject to two force represent them by two line draw from single point direction represent direction and length represent strength add two more line to complete parallelogram the resultant force on the body be represent by the diagonal of the parallelogram isn this theorem very widely useful doesn the doctrine of the composition and resolution of force depend on it and through that countless rule and theorems tell us how to act and explain phenomena all through mechanics and mathematical physics and if this theorem help men to get the knowledge of many inventions in mechanics and teach them how to make engines that they can use to do things that be otherwise hard or impossible and provide key to discover the nature of planetary motion in addition to all its usefulness here on earth be we go to say that it be not practically or theoretically useful because we have no distinct idea of force obviously not well give that we take that line with force what excuse have we for go different way with grace if there be query dispute perplexities and diverge notions and opinions about grace so there be about force also if we can form any precise distinct idea of grace neither can we of force oughtn we by parity of reason to conclude that there may be various true and useful proposition about grace just as there be about force and oughtn you also to conclude that grace may for all you know to the contrary be an object of our faith and influence our life and action by attack evil habit and support good ones even though we can get distinct idea of grace all on its own separate or abstract from god who produce it man who receive it and virtue and piety that result from it shan we allow the same method of argue the same rule of logic reason and good sense to hold sway in spiritual matter as in physical ones in faith as well as in physics and when we be examine god revelations shan we use the same candour and make the same allowance as we do when examine the discoveries of men can see how philosopher can be free from bias and prejudice or be say to weigh things in an equal balance if he maintain the doctrine of force and reject that of grace or admit the abstract idea of triangle while ridicule the holy trinity anyway however partial or prejudice other minute philosophers may be you have lay it down as maxim that the same logic which govern in other matter must be admit in religion alciphron think you do better to stay with the method of wit and humour rather than try religion by the dry test of reason and logic don worry by all the rule of right reason it be absolutely impossible that any mystery especially the trinity should really be the object of man faith not surprise that you think so while you hold that no one could assent to verbal proposition without form in his mind distinct ideas associate with the word in it but you have agree that those sign can be significant even if they don suggest ideas represent by them provide they serve to regulate and influence our will passions or behaviour which commit you to agree also that man mind can assent to proposition contain such term when it be direct or affect by them even if it doesn perceive in itself distinct ideas mark by those term it seem to follow from this that man can believe the doctrine of the trinity if he find it reveal in the bible that the father the son and the holy ghost be god and that there be only one god he can believe this doctrine of creator redeemer and sanctifier three persons make one substance even though he doesn form in his mind any abstract or distinct ideas of trinity person or substance provide that the doctrine have the right effect on his mind produce in it love hope gratitude and obedience thereby become lively operative principle that influence his life and action in ways that fit with the notion of save faith that be require in christian whether this be right or wrong it seem to follow from what you have declare together with what you have concede wonder if there be anything parallel to this christian faith in the minute philosophy suppose fine gentleman or lady of fashion who be too busy to think for themselves and be only free thinkers at second hand have the advantage of be initiate quite early into the principles of your sect by listen to men of depth and genius who have often express the opinion that the world be govern either by fate or by chance and it doesn matter which see note on page you win deny that it be possible for such persons to give their assent to either of these proposition the fate one and the chance one ii and their assent can properly be call faith iii and yet these disciples of the minute philosophy may be unable to dive deep enough to form any abstract or precise or definite idea of fate or of chance iv so that this same gentleman or lady may be say to believe or have faith where they don have ideas and this faith or conviction can produce real effect show itself in the conduct and tone of their live free them from the fear of superstition and give them true like for the world with noble indifference about any after life and can christians with equal reason be allow to believe in the divinity of our saviour or believe that in him god and man make one person and be genuinely convince of this so that this faith or belief become real principle of life and conduct because of this belief that they have they submit to his government believe his doctrine and behave accord to his precepts even though they don form any abstract idea of the union between the divine and human nature and even though they can clear up the notion of person in way that will satisfy minute philosopher it seem obvious to me that we wouldn so often be face with demand for clear and distinct idea of person in relation to the trinity and wouldn so often find difficulties about this be treat as objections to our faith if these demand and objections be make only by people who have delicately examine and could themselves explain the principle of individuation in man or could untie the knot and answer the objections that can be raise even about human personal identity alciphron say that he doesn think there be any great mystery in personal identity and express agreement with locke theory about this that be an open for euphranor to argue against locke thesis that as euphranor put it personal identity consist in consciousness the argument be not worth much as it be base on stunningly absurdly uncharitable read of locke it be launch by reid essay on the intellectual power of man essay chapter anyway this interchange contribute nothing to the rest of the dialogue which euphranor put back on track thus there be think practical kind of faith or assent that show itself in the will and action of man even if his understand isn furnish with correspond abstract precise distinct ideas you indeed have concede that there be many instance of such practical faith in other matter that don involve religion so why shouldn it be that doctrines relate to heavenly mysteries might also be teach in this save sense to common mind that you may well think incapable of all teach and faith of the sort you have be demand this mistake view of teach and faith say crito have lead to great deal of profane and misapply sarcasm but all that can fairly bounce back onto the minute philosophers themselves who muddle scholasticism with christianity and impute to other men the perplexities chimeras and inconsistent ideas that be often the work of their own brain and argue on the basis of their own wrong way of think anyone can see that such an ideal abstract faith be never think of by the great majority of christians farmers for example and artisans and servants and there nothing in the bible to suggest that either jews or christians be require to engage in the delicately precise form of abstract ideas nothing like this be to be find in the law or the prophets the evangelists or the apostles everyone whose understand be not pervert by science falsely so call can see that the save faith of christians be of quite another kind vital operative principle roughly source of energy or activity see in euphranor speech on page that generate charity and obedience then what can we make of the dispute and decisions of the famous council of nicaea which draw up the so call nicene creed and all the councils since that one what be the intention of those venerable father the homoousians and the homoiousians why do they disturb themselves and the world with hard word and subtle controversies those be greek word mean respectively the same and similar the controversy be between two view about the relationship of the son to the father whatever their intention be it couldn have be to do something that be obviously impossible namely create precise abstract ideas of mysteries in the mind of common christians there no evidence that the majority of christians in those days think they be oblige to set aside word shut their eye and form abstract ideas any more than men now form abstract ideas of force time number or many other things about which they nevertheless believe know argue and dispute it seem to me that whatever be the source of that controversy and however it be conduct what it be really about be not desire by either side to convey precise positive ideas to the mind of men by the use of those controversial term but rather something negative namely desire to exclude on one side the view that there be three gods and on the other the view that there be just one god of whom the father the son and the holy ghost be merely three aspects but so many learn and ingenious theologians have from time to time offer the world new explanations of mysteries claim to have work to get accurate ideas and want to recommend their discoveries and speculations to others as article of faith what be we to make of them to all such innovators in religion would say with hieronymus why after so many centuries do you claim to teach us something that hasn be teach before why explain things that neither peter nor paul think need to be explain the explanation of mysteries in divinity be as futile as the pursuit of the philosopher stone see note on page in chemistry or the perpetual motion machine in mechanics but in each of the three case the absurdity be to be blame not on that branch of enquiry but only on wrong head people engage in it what euphranor have be say seem to be applicable also to other mysteries of our religion we may find it impossible to form an abstract idea of original sin for example or an idea of how original sin be pass on from adam to the rest of us but the belief in it may produce in someone mind salutary sense of his own unworthiness and of the goodness of his redeemer and from that may follow good habit and from them good action which be the genuine effect of faith when faith be consider in its true light it can be see to be neither inconsistent nor incomprehensible as some men want us to think it be but suit even to common capacities place in the will and affections rather than in the understand and produce holy live rather than subtle theories faith isn something you passively let flow into you it an operative conviction of mind which always produce some suitable action disposition or emotion in those who have it could easily prove and illustrate this by countless instance take from human affairs and indeed while the christian religion be consider as an institution fit to ordinary mind rather than to the mind of hair split theoreticians and while our notions about faith be accordingly take from mankind ordinary everyday life rather than from the special systems of faith improvers don think it will be hard to understand the mean and use of our belief in mysteries and to justify them against the most confident assertions and objections of the minute philosophers who can easily be catch in the very trap that they have set for others and that spirit of controversy the mother and nurse of heresies would doubtless be much reduce if men would grasp that things should be rat not by their colour shape or trade mark so truly as by their weight if some litigious theologians have proportion their zeal to the importance of the opinions they be propound that would greatly reduce the zealous intensity of most of what they have to say which would have spar them and us great deal of trouble someone who take his notions of faith opinion and assent from common sense and common usage and have maturely weigh the nature of sign and of language win be so ready to quarrel about the word of mystery or to break the peace of the church so as to retain or reject word here plain example that should convince you of the effective and necessary use of faith without ideas the example concern convince minute philosopher coarse and callous man with large appetites and not much money who have an opportunity to perform one villainous act that will make him rich an act that he know he can get away with what be there to deter him certainly not sense of the beauty of virtue see alciphron speech on page in fact the only way to get some moral leverage on this man be to produce in him sincere belief in future state although it be mystery although it be what eye have not see nor ear hear nor have it enter into the heart of man to conceive corinthians this belief will restrain him from carry out his wicked project to reasonable reflective philosophical mind the point insist on by your refine beauty of virtue moralists may be as lovely and excellent as you please but venture to say that give mankind as it be very few people would be influence by them so we see the necessary use of faith as well as its powerful effect and none of this involve have ideas you and euphranor apparently want to convince me that the belief in mysteries doesn involve anything as utterly absurd as we be apt to think and that man needn renounce his reason to maintain his religion but if this be true why be it that men faith dwindle in proportion as their knowledge grow have learn from you alciphron that there be nothing like get to the bottom of things and analyse them into their basic elements so ll try to do that with the question of the nature of faith you ll have to judge whether succeed the objections that be make to faith don come from knowledge but rather from ignorance of what knowledge be and that ignorance might be find even in people who be regard as master of this or that particular branch of knowledge science and faith have this in common they both involve an assent of the mind and as the nature of scientific assent be most clear and evident we should consider it first in order to cast light on the assent involve in faith to trace things back to their origins the human mind need aid that be not part of its basic natural equipment it be naturally furnish with the ideas of particular and concrete as distinct from abstract things and what it design for be not merely be aware of its ideas but pursue its own happiness by actively operate on the basis of them for the scientific pursuit of knowledge about the origins of things therefore the mind need extra help specifically it need certain general rule or theorems to guide it in this pursuit and the true original reasonable end of study the arts and sciences be to acquire such rule because these rule be general they can be obtain by the mere consideration of the original ideas or particular things but only by mean of mark or sign and these be general in the sense that they be use for general purpose become the immediate instrument and materials of science so the mind make its progress not by mere contemplation of particular things even less by contemplate abstract general ideas of things but by appropriately choose and skillfully manage sign for example everyone know about force and number in concrete situations along with things that accompany them things that have them and sign of them and no one have any understand of force and number consider in the abstract and capture in precise abstract ideas so it clear that their abstract nature isn foundation for science and that merely consider their ideas in their concrete form isn the way to advance in the respective sciences of physics and mathematics because nothing be more evident than that someone who can read or write understand the mean of numeral word in concrete situations as well as the best scientist or mathematician but here lie the difference the one who understand the notation of number can use it to express briefly and clearly all the variety and degrees of number and to perform easily and quickly many arithmetical operations by the help of general rule it obvious how useful these operations be in human life and equally obvious that perform them require have an appropriate notation if mankind be in very primitive state with no use of language they wouldn know any truths of arithmetic their first step towards that science would be the acquisition of name for number so that they could signify number as high as you like by repeat those name in certain order the next step would be to associate those name with visible mark permanent ones not like sound which don last if this system of mark this notation be do well it would make it easier for us to discover and apply general rule to assist the mind in reason and judge and in extend record and communicate its knowledge about number what the mind be immediately concern with in these activities be the sign or numerals through which it be direct to act in relation to things or number in concrete as the logicians call it without ever consider the simple abstract intellectual general idea of number don think it be hard to be convince that the science of arithmetic be entirely concern in its rise operations rule and theorems with the conventional use of sign which be of two sort name that be word and numerals these name and numerals be in their roles as sign universal the name be relate to things the character be relate to the name and both name and character be relate to operations there aren many basic name of number the stock of them be enlarge by certain analogy so system of character will be useful to the extent that it be simple and aptly express this analogy thus word write at length be less useful than the old roman numerals which in turn be less useful than the modern notation for example two hundred and forty four be less useful than ccxliv which be less useful than and the invention of algebraical symbols be further advance for extensive and general use so there we have it arithmetic and algebra be sciences of great clearness certainty and extent whose immediate topic be sign on the skillful use and management of which they entirely depend perhaps little attention to them may help us to understand the progress of the mind in other sciences which differ in nature design and purpose but may nevertheless agree in the general methods of proof and inquiry in my view all sciences that be universal and demonstrable by human reason will be find to have sign as their immediate object though in apply science we connect these sign with things it isn hard to grasp why this be so nothing be more natural for us than to use the things we do know as step stone towards things we don know and to explain and represent less familiar things by others that be more familiar now it be certain that before we reflect we imagine and before we imagine we perceive by our sense and that of all our sense eyesight be the most clear distinct various agreeable and comprehensive so it natural for us to help the intellect by imagination to help imagination by sense and to help the other sense by sight hence figure metaphors and symbols we illustrate mental things by physical ones we substitute sound for thoughts and write letter for sound we use emblems symbols and hieroglyphics for things that be too obscure to strike our mind and too various or too fleet to be retain we substitute imaginable things for intelligible ones sensible things for imaginable ones smaller things for ones that be too big to comprehend easily and larger things for ones that be too small to be clearly pick out present things for absent ones permanent things for perish ones and visible things for invisible ones hence the use of model and diagram thus line be substitute for time velocity and other things of very different natures thus again we speak of mind in figurative way describe their operations by term borrow from perceptible things such as apprehend conceive reflect discourse and the like apprehend come from latin mean seize conceive from take together reflect from bend back discourse from run to and fro euphranor talk little about allegories plato represent the mind by the driver of wing chariot which etc etc then incline to think that the doctrine of sign matter great deal over very wide area and that if it be properly consider it would cast lot of light on things and provide genuine solution for many difficulties so we can say this much about all sign they don always suggest ideas signify to the mind when they do suggest ideas they aren general abstract ideas they have other use such as raise proper emotions produce certain dispositions or habit of mind and direct our action in pursuit of the happiness that be the ultimate end and design the primary spring and motive that set rational agents at work the real purpose of speech whether it be be use in reason or in express theoretical knowledge or faith or some degree of belief be not primarily to give or get ideas but rather to guide action aim at bring about some conceive good sometimes indeed word can lead to suitable action not merely without communicate any ideas but without such ideas be even possible an example be the algebraic sign stand for the square root of negative number this be useful in logical operations although it be impossible to have an idea of any such quantity as and what be true of algebraic sign be also true of word or language in fact modern algebra be language compact appropriate artificial sort of language and any algebraic calculation could be express by ordinary word much less conveniently but with nothing leave out also there no avoid the fact that even the mathematical sciences themselves suppose to the most clear and certain sciences that we have often fall short of the clear and distinct ideas that today minute philosophers whether knowingly or ignorantly insist on in the mysteries of religion talk here about mathematics consider as theory not about practical apply mathematics in absolutely any science or field of activity men will be sure to embarrass themselves with difficulties and dispute if they move from particulars to generalities from concrete things to abstractions or relinquish practical view and the useful purpose of knowledge in favour of barren theorise regard mean and instrument as ultimate end and struggle to get the precise ideas that they suppose to be associate with all word talk about difficulties and dispute such as the ones that have spring up in geometry about the nature of the angle of contact between circle and its tangent proportion indivisibles infinitesimals and various other matter despite all of which geometry itself be rightly admire as an excellent and useful science it really do prove useful in many real life situations where it govern and direct the action of men enable them to do in sound and accurate way things that would otherwise be faulty and uncertain and by parity of reason we shouldn regard any other doctrines that govern influence or direct the mind of man to be less true or excellent because they provide material for controversy and useless theorize by trouble makers this apply especially to the article of our christian faith with regard to which belief lead to persuasion which in turn influence the live and action of men as for the perplexity of contradictions and abstract notions that crop up in secular sciences and divine faith nit pickers may use it as an objection incautious people may stray into it while judicious people keep away from it the belief of christians can be justify without depart from the accept rule of reason and if any pious men think otherwise that probably result not of religion or of reason but merely of human weakness if there be especially many unbelievers in our time shan conclude that our time know more than former age only that it be more arrogantly self confident and don think that this confidence be result of much think it seem to me that the more thoroughly and extensively any man investigate and think about the principles aim and methods that occur in secular arts and sciences the more convince he will be that there no weight in the plausible objections that be bring against the mysteries of faith and he win have much difficulty maintain and justify his position use accept methods of argument and the common principles of logic appeal to countless parallel case all through the many branch of human knowledge in all of which the supposition of abstract ideas create the same difficulties accord to this doctrine anything can be maintain there ll be nothing absurd in popery not even in transubstantiation the doctrine that in the sacrament of the eucharist the bread and wine become the body and blood of jesus pardon me what have be say doesn justify any article of faith that isn contain in scripture be in conflict with human reason imply contradiction or lead to idolatry or wickedness of any kind those four disqualifiers be very different from not be representable by distinct or abstract ideas ll allow euphranor that your reason have all the force you mean it to have freely admit that there may be mysteries that we can believe things that we don understand and that faith can be useful even when what it about be not distinctly grasp in short agree that there can be faith and mysteries in other things but not in religion the plain reason for this be that it absurd to suppose there to be any such thing as religion and if there no religion then there can be religious faith or mysteries religion obviously imply the worship of god which worship presuppose reward and punishments which presuppose merit and demerits good and evil action and these presuppose human freedom and that be impossible which mean that religion which be build on it must be unreasonable and absurd it can be reasonable to have fear where there be no guilt and there can be guilt when everything that happen follow unavoidably from the structure of the world and the laws of motion here be what happen when man as we say raise his hand to shade his eye from the sun physical object strike on his sense organs specifically light particles strike his eye those organs the eye start vibration in the nerve that vibration be pass along to the soul or animal spirit in the brain or root of the nerve see note on page start up in them the kind of motion call volition the volition start up new movement in the animal spirit this cause the spirit to flow into certain nerve the events in those nerve cause bodily movements that constitute the action in question in our case cause his hand to go up over his eye and all of this happen necessarily by the laws of mechanism so the events that we ordinarily take to be human action should be regard as mechanical and it just wrong to think they have source that be free so there be no basis for praise or blame fear or hope reward or punishment and religion as have already point out be build on and presuppose those things if have understand you rightly alciphron you regard man as sort of organ that be play on by external object which produce different motion and effect in the organ depend on the different shape and textures of the nerve the comparison with an organ be not bad but the best comparison be with puppet certain particles come in straight line from all perceptible object compose so many ray or filaments that push pull and activate every part of the soul and body of man just as thread or wire operate on the joint of the little wooden machine ordinarily call puppet the only difference be that the puppet wire be thick and visible to ordinary eye whereas the former the ray or filaments that enter into the causation of human so call action be too fine and subtle to be spot by any but an able free thinker this splendidly account for all the operations that we have be teach to ascribe to source of think within us that an ingenious line of think and must contribute greatly to free men from all anxiety about moral notions by trace their action not to source in the human soul but rather to external things but have some worry about it you suppose the mind to be in literal sense move and you take its volitions to be mere motion but suppose someone say and let face it someone may that the soul be not body that motion be one thing and volition another like to know how you would go about convince such person your account will be very clear to those who accept that the soul be body and that all its act be merely motion give that basis our account of human nature be true fine and new but if someone deny your supposition that the soul be corporeal denial that it very easy to make then everything you have build on it collapse if we grant that the soul be body and volitions be motion we be certainly commit then to fatal necessity to the view that all our action be necessary in the sense that whatever we do we be fat to do bind to do inevitably go to do but see no reason for grant those two point on the contrary it seem clear that motion and think be two things as really and as obviously distinct from one another as triangle be from sound so it look as though your argument for the necessity of human action have premise that need to be prove just as badly as the conclusion do well if we suppose that the mind be not corporeal can still prove my conclusion shan baffle you with far fetch arguments and merely ask you to look into yourself and observe what happen when some object come before your mind your understand consider it then your judgment make some decree about it as thing to be choose or reject to be do or not do and if do then do thus and not so this decree of the judgment necessarily determine the will whose role be merely to carry out anything ordain by another faculty something necessary can be free so there no such thing as freedom of the will freedom be present only when there be an indifference to either side of the question when the deliberate mind be evenly poise between the alternatives power to act or not act without be tell what to do or in any way control by something external to the will and it obvious that the will can be free when it doesn have this indifference and this power and it equally obvious that the will be not indifferent in its action be absolutely determine and govern by the faculty of judgment my point be not affect by the question of what it be that move the judgment whether it the greatest present uneasiness as locke come to think or the greatest apparent good as many have think include locke to begin with or something else again whatever it be that move the judgment the fact remain that the will be always settle and control by the judgment and so be always subject to necessity nowhere in the entire human make up be there anything like free agent every faculty be determine in all its act by something external to it the understand for instance can alter one of its ideas it necessarily see each idea in the way that it present itself the appetites be carry towards their respective object by natural necessity reason can infer anything from anything just as it choose it be limit by the nature and connection of things and the eternal rule of reason which mean that it be subject to necessity and the same be true for all our other faculties as well as for the will itself as have already show and if we can believe the divine characterizer of our time the will must be agree to be the most slavish of all our faculties the earl of shaftesbury author of characteristics of etc be widely like and admire but even alciphron wouldn call him divine in make him do so berkeley be throw in sarcastic jibe of his own some admirers of the present work regret its intemperate hostility to shaftesbury appetite say that noble writer which be reason older and stronger brother be sure in every contest to be on the win side as for the will so highly boast of it be never better than football for those youngsters to kick or spin top for them to whip to keep it move the youngsters turn out to be very ill match and eventually the younger of them instead of now and then get in kick or lash to little purpose leave the ball or top and start to kick or lash his older brother crito comment sarcastically on the style and manner of this beautiful parable and ask why the weaker brother would get satisfaction from attack the stronger one alciphron brush this off and then the same conclusion can also prove from god foreknowledge whatever be certainly foreknow will certainly happen what will certainly happen be necessary necessary action can be the effect of free will so now you have this fundamental thesis in our free think philosophy demonstrate in two different ways see note on page the proposition that god create something that be free be not self contradictory ii so it be possible that there may be such thing as free creature iii this be something that you can conceive and suppose iv such free creature would think that he act and he would condemn himself for some action and approve of himself for others vi he would think that he deserve reward or punishment vii and all these characteristics be actually find in man tell me now what other qualities do your suppose free agent have ones that be not to be find in man if there aren any we must conclude that man have all the mark of free agent let me see be certainly mistake when concede that it be possible at least for almighty power to make such thing as free agent wonder how come to make such an absurd concession after what have be demonstrate in so many different ways certainly whatever doesn imply contradiction be possible for an infinite power and whatever be possible can be suppose therefore if rational agent isn self contradictory then rational agent can be suppose perhaps from this supposition might infer that man be free but win suppose him to be free agent since you apparently claim to have demonstrate that he isn but listen it common knowledge that men base their opinions about others on themselves but when you reach conclusion about me on the basis of what you know about yourself you may be mistake many things that be clear to someone with your strength of intellect be not so clear to me who be often puzzle rather than enlighten by those very proof that you regard as clear and evident can be thoroughly convince by any inference however logically sound it be if its premise aren clear so please let me put question to you your answer may sort out for me the things that at present be confuse about ll leave with you what have already say for you to consider and chew over it time now for lysicles and me to set out for london so there no time for long question and answer session then let me make couple of brief remark on what you have say you take that for grant something that can not grant when you say that whatever be certain be necessary to me certain and necessary seem to be very different because there nothing in certain that imply constraint and so there nothing in it that isn consistent with man be accountable for his action if it be foresee that such and such an action will be do can it also be foresee that it will be do as an effect of human choice and liberty you delicately abstract and distinguish the action of the mind judgment and will you use such term as power faculty act determination indifference freedom necessity and so on as if they stand for distinct abstract ideas and this supposition seem to ensnare the mind into the same perplexities and errors that have be see to accompany the doctrine of abstraction in every other context it self evident that there be such thing as motion and yet some philosophers have try by refine reason to prove there be no such thing walk before them be think the proper way to confute those ingenious men diogenes be report to have say à propos of zeno difficulty about how there could be motion solve it by walk it be equally obvious that man be free agent and though by abstract reason you might puzzle me and seem to prove that he isn so long as be conscious of my own action this inward evidentness of plain fact will bear me up against all your reason however subtle and refine they may be oppose plain proposition by obscure ones may convince me that your philosophers be clever but it win convince me that their opinions be true can conceive why the acute cratylus shaftesbury in his football metaphor page should allow power of act to the appetite and to reason the brothers but not to the will the football if we allow that the mind do contain these three distinct be don see how this could be true of them but don find it necessary to abstract and distinguish as many be in the soul of man as you do which reconcile me to the fact that can do so without any such distinction it be evident to me take myself as whole not as minutely dissect that be free agent not help to go further by be tell that the will be govern by the judgment or that it be determine by the object because in no ordinary everyday case can separate the decree of my judgment from the command of my will know that the sensible object be absolutely inert and so can determine anything and lastly be conscious that be an active be who can and do determine myself don know what theoretical result might get if be to suppose spiritual or mental things to be corporeal or to refine actual and real things into general abstract notions or by metaphysical skill to split simple and individual things into many part but if instead of any of that take things as they be and ask any plain untutored man whether he act or be free in this or that particular action he immediately say yes and immediately believe him on the basis of what find within myself and thus by an induction from particular case can draw the general conclusion that man be free agent even if can define or conceive an abstract notion of freedom in general if man be free he be clearly accountable and if you define and abstract and suppose and infer from your definitions abstractions and suppositions that there can be any freedom in man and then infer from this that he isn accountable shall take the liberty of depart from your metaphysical abstract sense and appeal to the common sense of mankind if we consider the notions people have of guilt and merit praise and blame accountable and unaccountable we ll find the question of whether to applaud or censure someone acquit or condemn him always rest on the question do he perform the action in question or what come to the same thing be he himself when he perform it so it seem that in our ordinary everyday think and talk person be regard as accountable if he be an agent you tell me that man be inactive and that perceptible object act on him but my own experience assure me of the contrary know act and be accountable for what do in act and if this be true then the foundation of religion and morality remain unshaken the only question in this area that religion be concern with be whether the man be accountable and accord to my sense and the world common sense he be accountable if he act and it self evident that he do act so the ground and purpose of religion be secure whether or not your philosophic notion of liberty fit man action and whether or not his action be certain or contingent do he deserve the guilt or merit of the action in ask that we aren ask do he do it with free will or what determine his will when he do it or be it certain or foreknow that he would do it the only question be do he do it wilfully but still the question keep come back be man free to answer this oughtn we first to settle what be mean by the word free we ought in my opinion man be say to be free insofar as he can do what he will to do isn that right it seem so so man who act accord to his will be to be account free admit that this be right in the vulgar see note on page sense of free but philosopher go higher than that and ask whether man be free to will that be whether he can will as he will don know how philosophical it may be to ask this question but to me it seem very idle the notions of guilt and merit justice and reward be in men mind in advance of any metaphysical lecture or chapters and accord to those accept natural notions there be no doubt that man be accountable that he act that he be self determine but minute philosopher mislead by wrong initial suppositions run together things that be obviously distinct body spirit motion volition certainty necessity and an abstracter or refiner analyse the simplest instantaneous act of the mind to the point where he think he can find within it various faculties and tendencies principles and operations cause and effect note the symmetry identify things that be really distinct and distinguish things that be really identical and after he have abstract suppose and reason concern gratuitous and obscure principles he will conclude that the act in question isn an act at all and that man be not an agent but puppet or an organ play on by external object and his will be top or football and this pass for philosophy and free think whatever it pass for it doesn at all seem like natural or sound way of think it seem to me that if we start from things that be particular and concrete and proceed from them to general notions and conclusions we ll have no trouble in this area but if we start with generalities and lay our foundations in abstract ideas we ll find ourselves entangle and lose in labyrinth of our own make needn point out because anyone can see it how ridiculous it be to claim to prove that man be not an agent while also plead for free think and action thus pose as advocate of necessity and of liberty have hastily throw together these hint or remark about this fundamental thesis in our free think philosophy as you call it and about your method of argue for it which seem to provide fine specimen of the sophistry of abstract ideas if my brevity have lead me to be inappropriately dogmatic you must excuse me you start it by decline to join me in leisurely examination of the truth think we have examine matter sufficiently to everything you have say against human liberty it be sufficient answer to point out that your arguments be wrong from the outset either because they suppose the soul to be corporeal or because they rely on abstract ideas suppose the soul to be solid be no better than suppose it to be red or blue suppose the will to consist in motion be no better than suppose the will to be you name it these premise about the soul and the will be to put it mildly neither prove nor probable and see no obstacle to reject everything you infer from them and your arguments also contain other gross mistake and baseless principles in any human action you distinguish the last decree of the judgment from the act of the will you confuse certainty with necessity you ask in effect the absurd question can man will as he will the proposition man will as he will be an identical one necessarily true logical triviality that be obviously the case which mean that obviously there must be something wrong with the line of think that lead you to make question of it you say that the appetites have by natural necessity tendency towards their respective object agree and add my agreement that appetites be not free but you go further tell us the understand can alter an idea that it have nor can it infer indifferently anything from anything just as it choose what of it if we can alter the nature of object do that mean that we can act at all the two versions of reflect berkeley view defend in other work but mainly not in play in this one that the object that we perceive and talk about be ideas and if we aren at liberty to make absurd inferences do it follow that we aren free in any way you take it for grant that the mind be inactive but that its ideas act on it as if the contrary weren evident to everyone who have the common sense to know that when the mind consider its ideas it choose reject examine deliberate decree it act on them and they don act on it sum up because your premise be obscure and false the basic point that you claim to have demonstrate in so many different ways isn show to be true or even meaningful and on the other hand we don have to do much research to be convince that man act and that man be accountable for his action nothing be clearer or more obvious than those two proposition nothing be more universally accept by men of all sort learn and unlearn at all time and in all place whatever may be claim by abstracters refiners and men who be commit to false hypothesis think it be obvious to every think man of common sense that human mind be so far from be machine or footballs act on and kick around by corporeal object with no inner source of freedom or of action that the only basic true notions we have of freedom agent and action be ones we get by reflect on ourselves and the operations of our own mind the minute philosophers allow themselves to be take in by the invalid inferences of three or four eminent bishops of unbelief in recent time can think of anything that match their unique credulity any other bigoted superstition whose ringleaders have be able so openly and widely to draw their followers from the plain dictate of nature and common sense the discoverers of truth have always meet up with the objection that they be depart from accept opinions the sneer label unique be tax on free think and as such we most willingly accept it and glory in it genuine philosopher be never modest in such way as to prefer authority to reason or an old and common opinion to true one such false modesty discourage men from tread in untrodden paths and from shin new light and that make it greater enemy to free think than any other personal quality judicious person who will follow evidence wherever it lead will also allow authority to have its due weight on disputable point without prefer authority we can accept it as good back up to reason so your gentlemen of the minute philosophy can save yourself the trouble of announce all those commonplaces about reason and discoveries and light we aren attach to authority against reason or afraid of untrodden paths that lead to truth and we be ready to follow new light once we be sure it isn will the wisp reason may oblige man to believe something that he doesn like but why should man give up salutary notions in favour of others that be as unreasonable as they be harmful your scheme principles and boast demonstrations have be propose and examine at length you have shift your notions successively retreat from one scheme to another and in the end renounce them all your objections to christianity have be treat in the same manner and with the same outcome if from the things you have hold against christianity we set aside everything that come from the errors and fault of particular persons and difficulties which from the nature of things we aren oblige to explain it be surprise to see how little remain after such magnificent threats that can amount to relevant objection against the christian religion what you have produce have be try by the fair test of reason and even if you hope to get the upper hand through ridicule when you can get it through reason predict that in the upshot you ll find that you can destroy all sense of religion how berkeley start the next sentence make your countrymen ever so vicious ignorant and profane either he mean however vicious ignorant and profane you claim your countrymen to be or he mean however vicious ignorant and profane you cause your countrymen to be men will still be dispose to look up to supreme be religion right or wrong will survive in some shape or other and there will surely be some worship either of god or the creature that be berkeley phrase mean as for your ridicule well your sect present us with the spectacle of the most unintelligible men of the age parade themselves as free thinkers men so strong in assertion yet so weak in argument advocate for freedom introduce necessity patriots trample on the laws of their country claimants to virtue destroy the motives for virtue can anything be more ridiculous than that let any impartial man cast an eye on the opinions of the minute philosophers and then say if anything can be more ridiculous than to believe such things and at the same time laugh at the credulity of others say what you will we have the laughers on our side and as for your reason take that to be another name for sophistry and suppose by the same rule you take your own sophisms to be arguments let me be frank about this don know of any type of sophism any type of logical mistake that minute philosophers don use against religion they be guilty of work from false assumptions in take it for grant that we believe contradictions of bad causal think in assert that uncharitable feud and discord be the effect of christianity and of point miss in demand that we demonstrate things that we only claim to believe as matter of faith crito give each of these technical latin label speak for myself if sophistry be the art or power of deceive other men must acquit these gentlemen of it they seem to have lead me on journey through atheism libertinism fanaticism and fatalism not to convince me of the truth of any of them so much as to confirm me in my own way of think they have display their flimsy war not to cheat but to amuse us know them to be self announce master of ridicule don know what seriously to make of them you don know what to make of us be sorry if you do only superficial philosopher can be quickly fathom create ambiguity about where one stand seem to be the sure way to fame and esteem in the learn world as it now be when an able reader can decide whether his author be atheist or deist or polytheist stoic or epicurean sceptic or dogmatist unbeliever or religious fanatic joke or serious he immediately conclude that the author be enigmatic and deep in fact it true of the most admire writers of our time that no one can tell what to make of them or what they be get at we have among us moles that dig deep under grind and eagle that soar out of sight we can act all part and become all opinions put them on or off with great freedom of wit and humour it seem then that you be pair of inscrutable unfathomable fashionable philosophers that can be deny but remember that you start off with an open dogmatic air talk of plain principles and evident reason and promise to make things as clear as noonday to wipe out wrong notions and plant right ones in their place before long though you begin to back away from your first notions and adopt others you advance one while retract another assert and concede say and unsay and after have follow you through so many untrodden paths and intricate mazes find myself no nearer to understand what you actually think didn we tell you that the gentlemen of our sect be very good at tease but it seem to me to be useless for plain man with some settle beliefs or principles to do battle with such slippery dodge changeable philosophers the rule seem to be the christian man must stand still in one place while his free think adversary choose and change his fight position have full range and liberty to move around the battle field and attack his christian opponent on all side in all shape from close up or with missiles from far away on horseback or on foot in light or heavy armour there no deny that gentleman have great advantage over strait lace pedant or bigot but at the end of it all how be better off from the conversation of two such knowledgeable gentlemen hop to unlearn my errors and to learn truths from you but find to my great disappointment that haven be unteach anything or teach anything it hard to unteach men their prejudice but that have to be do before we can offer to teach them the truth and anyway we don now have time to prove and argue the ensue remark about laws of hospitality confinement in the castle etc be run joke it look like rather thin cover for the anger and contempt that have be build up especially on the christian side well suppose that my mind be white paper and that you be invite to write on it the things that you would teach me if only be teachable don try to wipe out my present opinions or to prove your own for once don joke or tease just let me know some one conclusion of yours before we part if you don ll beg crito to violate the laws of hospitality towards those who have violate the laws of philosophy by hang out false light to someone who be accord to you benight in ignorance and error false light be light place on the sea shore in position that be likely to draw ship onto the rock appeal to you shouldn these philosophical knight errants be confine in this castle of yours until they make reparation euphranor be right say crito and my sentence be that you remain here in prison until you have do something towards satisfy my undertake to euphranor which be that he would know your opinions from yourselves which you also agree to since it must be so will now reveal what take to be the sum and substance the grand arcanum see note on page and final conclusion of our sect can do it in two word and he utter two greek word sentence which mean there be only hypotheses so you re downright sceptic but sceptic as you be you admit that it be probable that there be god certain that the christian religion be useful possible that it be true certain that if it be true the minute philosophers be in bad shape give all this how can there be any question about what course wise man should take whether the principles of christians or unbelievers be truest may be make question but there be no question about which be safest if you have doubt about all opinions you must have doubt about your own which mean that for all you know christianity may be true the more doubt the more room there be for faith because sceptic have less right than anyone else to demand evidence evidentness but whatever uncertainty there may be about some things this much be certain either there be god or there isn either there be revelation or there isn either man be an agent or he isn either the soul be immortal or it isn if the negative be not sure the affirmatives be possible if the negative be improbable the affirmatives be probable the more any of your able men find himself unable to prove any one of these negative the stronger ground he have to suspect he may be mistake so minute philosopher who want to act consistently ought to share with the sceptic not merely the sceptic doubt but also his diffidence his modesty and his timidity he shouldn announce an ocean of light and then lead us to an aby of darkness if that conduct isn ridiculous don know what ridiculous mean as for your ridicule something that may for all you know be true can make any sense of that it isn act as wise man with regard to your own interest or as good man with regard to the interest of your country cicero say somewhere let us either get rid of religion altogether or retain it altogether if there be single instance of people prosper without any religion propose in the british parliament that we change our constitution and live without religion if there be any religion better than christianity propose to the parliament that we introduce that new religion sceptic be member of community just like any other man and he can distinguish good from evil whether natural or political and his knowledge of this distinction should be his guide as patriot even though he isn christian and if he doesn claim to know even this much he should stop claim to correct or alter something that he know nothing about also someone who merely doubt shouldn behave as if he could demonstrate consider someone who say find my country in possession of certain tenets namely those of christianity they appear to do good which be why they be encourage by the legislature they be main part of our constitution and don find that these free think innovators can disprove them or substitute things more useful and certain in their place so shall go along with those tenets out of regard for the good of mankind and for the laws of my country don say that this man be christian but regard him as patriot with something that matter as much as christianity do not to inquire be folly but it be even greater folly to condemn without inquire lysicles seem heartily tire of this conversation it be now late he say to alciphron and everything be ready for our departure everyone have his own way of think and can no more adopt another man way of think than can adopt his complexion and facial feature alciphron plead that they have comply with euphranor condition for be release from the castle and that they should now be set free and euphranor answer that he have no further claim to make all he have want be to know their tenets epilogue after the philosophers have leave remark to crito that it be hard to understand how men who be so easy to confute should be so difficult to convince aristotle explain this say crito he say that arguments don have an effect on everyone but only on those whose mind be prepare by upbringing and habit as land be prepare for seed nichomachean ethics however clear point be the odds be that it win be understand by someone whose habit and cast of mind go against it so weak thing be reason when in competition with inclination reply that this answer might hold with respect to some people at some time but that it didn seem satisfactory when apply to inquire men at time when reason be so much cultivate and think so much in vogue man who be keen social observer say crito have say that these days think be talk of more than it be in ancient time but practise less and that since the revival of learn men have read much and write much but think little so that for us think closely and soundly be tiny part of what learn man do and doesn figure at all in the activities of the socially polish man the free thinkers it must be admit parade themselves as thinkers but don show much exactness in their think lively man and what the world call man of sense be often no good at all at think the ability to think be not mere gift of nature but must be improve and perfect by much attention and exercise on very different subject which mean that it require more time and trouble than today quick off the mark men care to take those be the view of judicious friend of mine if you aren already sufficiently convince of their truth you need only look at the dark confuse admire writers of this famous sect then you ll be able to judge whether those who be lead by men whose head be so wrong can have very good head of their own take for example spinoza the great leader of our modern unbelievers whose write contain many scheme and notions that have be much admire and follow in recent years for example undermine religion under the pretence of vindicate and explain it maintain that it isn necessary to believe in christ accord to the flesh persuade men that miracles be to be understand only in spiritual and allegorical sense that vice be not as bad thing as we be apt to think that men be mere machine impel by fatal necessity remark have hear spinoza describe as man of close argument and demonstration he do indeed demonstrate reply crito but by his standards anyone could demonstrate anything if man be allow the privilege of make his own definitions of common word it will be easy for him to demonstrate conclusions that be true in one sense and false in another true and indeed manifest truisms in his sense but false and indeed seem paradoxes when the word be take in their ordinary sense for example let spinoza define natural right to be natural power and he will easily demonstrate that whatever man can do he have right to do the folly of this procedure be utterly obvious but our free thinkers who claim to have the lumen siccum be so passionately prejudice against religion that they ll accept as demonstrations the grossest nonsense and sophistry of weak and wicked writers lumen siccum be latin for dry light it come from bacon brilliant metaphor the human intellect doesn burn with dry light because what the person want and feel get pump into it and these men make so much noise with their think reason and demonstrate that they prejudice some well mean people against all use and improvement of reason one man saw neighbour of his ruin by the vices of free think son and acquire such prejudice against think that he wouldn let his own son read euclid because he have be tell that it might teach him to think he be rescue from this by friend who convince him that the epidemic be not an outbreak of think but merely an unthinking pretence of think know one eminent free thinker who never go to bed without gallon of wine in his belly and he always replenish it before the fume have leave his brain so that he hasn have one sober think in the past seven years he add two more anecdotes report disgraceful behaviour by free thinkers then it be strange say crito that such men should parade themselves as free thinkers but it even stranger that other men should be on bad term with think and reason because of such pretenders answer that some good men think there be an opposition between reason and religion knowledge and faith nature and grace and be lead by that to conclude that the way to promote religion be to quench the light of nature and to discourage all rational inquiry shan comment on the intentions of these men reply crito but surely their notions be very wrong what could dishonour religion more than represent it as an unreasonable unnatural ignorant institution god be the father of all light natural as well as reveal natural greed be one thing and the natural light be another and you can argue that because one be bad so be the other similarly you can argue that because false knowledge be bad that real knowledge be bad also so whatever be say about one of them in the bible be not to be interpret as have say something about the other insist that human learn in the hand of theologians have from time to time create great dispute and divisions in the church just as abstract metaphysics have always tend to produce dispute among christians as well as other men say crito it should seem that genuine truth and knowledge would calm this mood that make men sacrifice the undisputed duties of peace and charity to disputable notions after all say whatever may be say for reason the sceptics and unbelievers of today win be cure by it win dispute that say crito to cure an illness you should consider what produce it if men have reason themselves into wrong opinion one might hope to reason them out of it but that not how things stand the unbelief of minute philosophers seem to arise from things very different from think and reason people be often turn into unbelievers by little incidents vanity disgust mood inclination without any help from reason face with doctrine whose general tendency one find disagreeable the mind be prepare to enjoy and improve everything that can possibly be think to count against it thus someone reason for his unbelief may be the coarse manners of some country curate the polish manners of great family chaplain the wit of minute philosopher joke song tale vice laziness quarrelsomeness and fashion produce minute philosophers and quite lot of people become minute philosophers through sheer bad temper who can expect such an irrational and capricious thing should yield to reason still it may be worthwhile to argue against such men and expose their fallacies if not for their sake then for the sake of others who might otherwise be sway by them the most general pretext that look like reason be the one that point to the variety of opinions about religion this be rock for lazy and superficial mind to sit on and take rest but more spirit mind with sounder way of think will stand on it and look around examine and compare the differ institutions of religion he will want to know of all these which be the most sublime and rational in its doctrines the most venerable in its mysteries most useful in its command most decent in its worship which create the noblest hop and most worthy view he will consider their rise and progress and try to discover which owe least to human arts or arm which flatter the sense and gross inclinations of men which adorn and improve the most excellent part of our nature which have be propagate in the most wonderful manner which have overcome the greatest difficulties or show the most disinterested not self interest zeal and sincerity in its adherents he will inquire into which square best with nature and history he will consider which savour of the world and which look like wisdom from above he ll be careful to separate human alloy from anything that be divine and over all he will form his judgment like reasonable free thinker but instead of take such rational course one of those hasty sceptics will conclude straight off that there no wisdom in politics no honesty in business no knowledge in philosophy no truth in religion and all by the same sort of inference from premise about the numerous examples of folly knavery ignorance and error that be to be meet with in the world and because people who know nothing about anything think they be sharp sight in religion this learn sophism be oftenest level against christianity in my opinion if you want to convince an unbeliever who can be bring to reason you should start by clearly convince him of the existence of god because it seem to me that real theist can be an enemy to the christian religion and that what basically make someone minute philosopher be his ignorance or disbelief about god existence those who be acquaint with the great author in the minute philosophy presumably don need to be tell this that god exist can be clearly prove and be proper object of human reason whereas the mysteries of his nature and indeed any other mysteries there be in religion can possibly be explain and prove by reason it be sufficient if we show that there nothing absurd or selfcontradictory in our beliefs on those matter and instead of form hypotheses to explain them use our reason only for answer the objections bring against them but we ought always to distinguish the serious modest honest man of sense who have doubt about religion and behave like prudent man in doubt from the minute philosophers those profane and conceited men who insist on try to convert others to their own doubt when someone of this kind present himself we should consider what species he belong to first hand philosopher second hand philosopher libertine scorner sceptic each type require its own special treatment some men be too ignorant to be humble and without humility nothing can be learn but though man can be convince of anything unless he have do some think and consider even the most ignorant and thoughtless can sometimes be laugh out of their opinions once saw bright woman get the better of two minute philosophers by take her cue from their predominant claim about themselves to the one who claim to be the most incredulous man upon earth she remark that for someone who be credulous enough to trust the most valuable things his life and his fortune to his pharmacist and his lawyer it be absurd to claim to be too incredulous to trust his soul mere trifle accord to him to his parish priest to the other nattily dress dandy who say that he favour the most unbounded freedom she remark that he be an absolute slave in matter of dress to him the most important thing in the world while he be earnestly contend for freedom of think which be something he never bother to do there be very few first hand minute philosophers not enough of them to matter in themselves but their followers who pin their faith on them be numerous and be as confident as they be credulous and they do matter because there something in the air and manner of these second hand philosophers that be very apt to disconcert serious man who believe in argument it much harder to put up with than the weight of their objections euphranor suggest that it would be greatly to the public benefit if instead of discourage free think there be erect dianoetic academy think tank or seminary for free thinkers provide with quiet room and galleries and shady walk and groves where after seven years of silence and meditation man might become genuine free thinker and from then on be legally entitle to think what he please and have badge to distinguish him from counterfeit really seriously say crito think that what the present time need most be more think and that the real cause of whatever be wrong can fairly be attribute to the general neglect of education in those who need it most namely the people of fashion what can be expect when those who have the most influence have the least sense and those who be sure to be follow set the worst example when the young be so uneducated and yet be hear from so much when modesty be regard as feebleness and deference to years knowledge religion and laws be regard as lack of sense and spirit he evidently mean that modesty etc be regard etc by the young because he go on such precocious development wouldn have be value or encourage by the wise men of antiquity whose view on this matter be so out of line with the spirit of our time that modern ears afraid couldn bear them what go to say would seem ridiculous to our british youth who be so full of ideas and so boldly in favour of try out new things and set their country to right but think it will be accept by men of sense it be this if today governments would try as an experiment to consider themselves in that old homeric light as pastors of the people whose duty it be to improve their flock they would soon find that this require very different kind of upbringing from the modern one and different maxims from those of the minute philosophy if our youth be really accustom to think and reflection and an acquaintance with the excellent writers of antiquity we see the licentious frame of mind commonly call free think banish from the presence of gentlemen along with ignorance and bad taste and one reform in how the young be bring up need special attention as things be men follow vice for the sake of pleasure and fly from virtue because they hate pain so what be need be for young mind to be form and accustom to receive pleasure and pain from proper object to have their inclinations and aversions point in the right directions anyone who feel the curse effect of wrong upbringing in his mind his health or his fortune should ponder this think there be no better way for you to make amend for what be wrong in yourself than prevent it from be wrong also in your descendants while crito be say this other guests come in which put an end to our conversation
