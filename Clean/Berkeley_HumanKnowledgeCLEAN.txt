a treatise concern the principles of human knowledge wherein the chief cause of error and difficulty in the sciences with the ground of scepticism atheism and irreligion be inquire into first print in the year to which be add three dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to scepticks and atheists first print in the year both write by george berkeley a fellow of trinitycollege dublin london print for jacob tonson introduction philosophy be nothing else but the study of wisdom and truth it may with reason be expect that those who have spend most time and pain in it should enjoy a greater calm and serenity of mind a greater clearness and evidence of knowledge and be less disturb with doubt and difficulties than other men yet so it be we see the illiterate bulk of mankind that walk the highroad of plain common sense and be govern by the dictate of nature for the most part easy and undisturbed to them nothing thats familiar appear unaccountable or difficult to comprehend they complain not of any want of evidence in their sense and be out of all danger of become sceptics but no sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a superior principle to reason meditate and reflect on the nature of things but a thousand scruple spring up in our mind concern those things which before we seem fully to comprehend prejudice and errors of sense do from all part discover themselves to our view and endeavour to correct these by reason we be insensibly draw into uncouth paradoxes difficulties and inconsistencies which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in speculation till at length have wanderd through many intricate mazes we find our selves just where we be or which be worse sit down in a forlorn scepticism the cause of this be think to be the obscurity of things or the natural weakness and imperfection of our understand it be say the faculties we have be few and those design by nature for the support and comfort of life and not to penetrate into the inward essence and constitution of things besides the mind of man be finite when it treat of things which partake of infinity it be not to be wonder at if it run into absurdities and contradictions out of which it be impossible it should ever extricate it self it be of the nature of infinite not to be comprehend by that which be finite but perhaps we may be too partial to our selves in place the fault originally in our faculties and not rather in the wrong use we make of them it be a hard thing to suppose that right deductions from true principles should ever end in consequences which can not be maintain or make consistent we should believe that god have deal more bountifully with the sons of men than to give them a strong desire for that knowledge which he have place quite out of their reach this be not agreeable to the wonted indulgent methods of providence which whatever appetites it may have implant in the creatures doth usually furnish them with such mean as if rightly make use of will not fail to satisfy them upon the whole i be incline to think that the far greater part if not all of those difficulties which have hitherto amusd philosophers and blockd up the way to knowledge be intirely owe to our selves that we have first raisd a dust and then complain we can not see my purpose therefore be to try if i can discover what those principles be which have introduce all that doubtfulness and uncertainty those absurdities and contradictions into the several sects of philosophy insomuch that the wisest men have think our ignorance incurable conceive it to arise from the natural dulness and limitation of our faculties and surely it be a work well deserve our pain to make a strict inquiry concern the first principles of humane knowledge to sift and examine them on all side especially since there may be some ground to suspect that those let and difficulties which stay and embarass the mind in its search after truth do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the object or natural defect in the understand so much as from false principles which have be insist on and might have be avoid how difficult and discourage soever this attempt may seem when i consider how many great and extraordinary men have go before me in the same design yet i be not without some hop upon the consideration that the largest view be not always the clearest and that he who be shortsighted will be oblige to draw the object nearer and may perhaps by a close and narrow survey discern that which have escape far better eye in order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceive what follow it be proper to premise somewhat by way of introduction concern the nature and abuse of language but the unravel this matter lead me in some measure to anticipate my design by take notice of what seem to have have a chief part in render speculation intricate and perplex and to have occasion innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all part of knowledge and that be the opinion that the mind hath a power of frame abstract ideas or notions of things he who be not a perfect stranger to the write and dispute of philosophers must need acknowledge that no small part of them be spend about abstract ideas these be in a more especial manner think to be the object of those sciences which go by the name of logic and metaphysics and of all that which pass under the notion of the most abstract and sublime learn in all which one shall scarce find any question handle in such a manner as do not suppose their existence in the mind and that it be well acquaint with them it be agree on all hand that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by it self and separate from all others but be mixd as it be and blend together several in the same object but we be tell the mind be able to consider each quality singly or abstract from those other qualities with which it be unite do by that mean frame to it self abstract ideas for example there be perceive by sight an object extend colour and move this mixd or compound idea the mind resolve into its simple constituent part and view each by it self exclusive of the rest do frame the abstract ideas of extension colour and motion not that it be possible for colour or motion to exist without extension but only that the mind can frame to it self by abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension again the mind have observe that in the particular extensions perceivd by sense there be something common and alike in all and some other things peculiar as this or that figure or magnitude which distinguish them one from another it consider apart or single out by it self that which be common make thereof a most abstract idea of extension which be neither line surface nor solid nor have any figure or magnitude but be an idea intirely prescinded from all these so likewise the mind by leave out of the particular colour perceive by sense that which distinguish them one from another and retain that only which be common to all make an idea of colour in abstract which be neither red nor blue nor white nor any other determinate colour and in like manner by consider motion abstractedly not only from the body move but likewise from the figure it describe and all particular directions and velocities the abstract idea of motion be frame which equally correspond to all particular motion whatsoever that may be perceive by sense and as the mind frame to it self abstract ideas of qualities or modes so do it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compound be which include several coexistent qualities for example the mind have observe that peter jam and john resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities leave out of the complex or compound idea it have of peter jam and any other particular man that which be peculiar to each retain only what be common to all and so make an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally partake abstract intirely from and cut off all those circumstances and differences which might determine it to any particular existence and after this manner it be say we come by the abstract idea of man or if you please humanity or humane nature wherein it be true there be include colour because there be no man but have some colour but then it can be neither white nor black nor any particular colour because there be no one particular colour wherein all men partake so likewise there be include stature but then it be neither tall stature nor low stature nor yet middle stature but something abstract from all these and so of the rest moreover there be a great variety of other creatures that partake in some part but not all of the complex idea of man the mind leave out those part which be peculiar to men and retain those only which be common to all the live creatures frameth the idea of animal which abstract not only from all particular men but also all bird beasts fish and insects the constituent part of the abstract idea of animal be body life sense and spontaneous motion by body be mean body without any particular shape or figure there be no one shape or figure common to all animals without cover either of hair or feather or scale c nor yet naked hair feather scale and nakedness be the distinguish properties of particular animals and for that reason leave out of the abstract idea upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walk nor fly nor creep it be nevertheless a motion but what that motion be it be not easy to conceive whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstract their ideas they best can tell for my self i find indeed i have a faculty of imagine or represent to myself the ideas of those particular things i have perceive and of variously compound and divide them i can imagine a man with two head or the upper part of a man join to the body of a horse i can consider the hand the eye the nose each by it self abstract or separate from the rest of the body but then whatever hand or eye i imagine it must have some particular shape and colour likewise the idea of man that i frame to my self must be either of a white or a black or a tawny a straight or a crook a tall or a low or a middlesized man i can not by any effort of think conceive the abstract idea above describe and it be equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body move and which be neither swift nor slow curvilinear nor rectilinear and the like may be say of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever to be plain i own my self able to abstract in one sense as when i consider some particular part or qualities separate from others with which though they be unite in some object yet it be possible they may really exist without them but i deny that i can abstract one from another or conceive separately those qualities which it be impossible should exist so separate or that i can frame a general notion by abstract from particulars in the manner aforesaid which two last be the proper acceptations of abstraction and there be ground to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case the generality of men which be simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions it be say they be difficult and not to be attain without pain and study we may therefore reasonably conclude that if such there be they be confine only to the learn i proceed to examine what can be alledged in defence of the doctrine of abstraction and try if i can discover what it be that incline the men of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as that seem to be there have be a late deservedly esteem philosopher who no doubt have give it very much countenance by seem to think the have abstract general ideas be what put the widest difference in point of understand betwixt man and beast the have of general ideas saith he be that which put a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and be an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no mean attain unto for it be evident we observe no footsteps in them of make use of general sign for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstract or make general ideas since they have no use of word or any other general sign and a little after therefore i think we may suppose that it be in this that the species of brutes be discriminate from men and tis that proper difference wherein they be wholly separate and which at last widen to so wide a distance for if they have any ideas at all and be not bare machine as some would have them we can not deny them to have some reason it seem as evident to me that they do some of them in certain instance reason as that they have sense but it be only in particular ideas just as they receive them from their sense they be the best of them tie up within those narrow bound and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction essay on hum underst b sect and i readily agree with this learn author that the faculties of brutes can by no mean attain to abstraction but then if this be make the distinguish property of that sort of animals i fear a great many of those that pass for men must be reckon into their number the reason that be here assign why we have no ground to think brutes have abstract general ideas be that we observe in them no use of word or any other general sign which be build on this supposition to wit that the make use of word imply the have general ideas from which it follow that men who use language be able to abstract or generalize their ideas that this be the sense and argue of the author will further appear by his answer the question he in another place put since all things that exist be only particulars how come we by general term his answer be word become general by be make the sign of general ideas essay on hum underst b sect but it seem that a word become general by be make the sign not of an abstract general idea but of several particular ideas any one of which it indifferently suggest to the mind for example when it be say the change of motion be proportional to the impress force or that whatever have extension be divisible these proposition be to be understand of motion and extension in general and nevertheless it will not follow that they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without a body move or any determinate direction and velocity or that i must conceive an abstract general idea of extension which be neither line surface nor solid neither great nor small black white nor red nor of any other determinate colour it be only imply that whatever motion i consider whether it be swift or slow perpendicular horizontal or oblique or in whatever object the axiom concern it hold equally true as do the other of every particular extension it matter not whether line surface or solid whether of this or that magnitude or figure by observe how ideas become general we may the better judge how word be make so and here it be to be note that i do not deny absolutely there be general ideas but only that there be any abstract general ideas for in the passages above quote wherein there be mention of general ideas it be always suppose that they be form by abstraction after the manner set forth in sect viii and now if we will annex a mean to our word and speak only of what we can conceive i believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which consider in it self be particular become general by be make to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort to make this plain by an example suppose a geometrician be demonstrate the method of cut a line in two equal part he draw for instance a black line of an inch in length this which in it self be a particular line be nevertheless with regard to its signification general since as it be there use it represent all particular line whatsoever so that what be demonstrate of it be demonstrate of all line or in other word of a line in general and as that particular line become general by be make a sign so the name line which take absolutely be particular by be a sign be make general and as the former owe its generality not to its be the sign of an abstract or general line but of all particular right line that may possibly exist so the latter must be think to derive its generality from the same cause namely the various particular line which it indifferently denote to give the reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas and the use they be think necessary to i shall add one more passage out of the essay on human understand which be as follow abstract ideas be not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grow men it be only because by constant and familiar use they be make so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas be fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we be apt to imagine for example do it not require some pain and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which be yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it be something imperfect that can not exist an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistent ideas be put together it be true the mind in this imperfect state have need of such ideas and make all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it be naturally very much incline but yet one have reason to suspect such ideas be mark of our imperfection at least this be enough to shew that the most abstract and general ideas be not those that the mind be first and most easily acquaint with nor such as its earliest knowledge be conversant about b sect if any man have the faculty of frame in his mind such an idea of a triangle as be here describe it be in vain to pretend to dispute him out of it nor would i go about it all i desire be that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he have such an idea or no and this methinks can be no hard task for anyone to perform what more easy than for anyone to look a little into his own thoughts and there try whether he have or can attain to have an idea that shall correspond with the description that be here give of the general idea of a triangle which be neither oblique nor rectangle equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once much be here say of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them and the pain and skill requisite to the form them and it be on all hand agree that there be need of great toil and labour of the mind to emancipate our thoughts from particular object and raise them to those sublime speculations that be conversant about abstract ideas from all which the natural consequence should seem to be that so difficult a thing as the form abstract ideas be not necessary for communication which be so easy and familiar to all sort of men but we be tell if they seem obvious and easy to grow men it be only because by constant and familiar use they be make so now i would fain know at what time it be men be imployed in surmount that difficulty and furnish themselves with those necessary help for discourse it can not be when they be grow up for then it seem they be not conscious of any such painstaking it remain therefore to be the business of their childhood and surely the great and multiply labour of frame abstract notions will be find a hard task for that tender age be it not a hard thing to imagine that a couple of children can not prate together of their sugarplumbs and rattle and the rest of their little trinkets till they have first tack together numberless inconsistencies and so frame in their mind abstract general ideas and annex them to every common name they make use of nor do i think them a whit more needful for the enlargement of knowledge than for communication it be i know a point much insist on that all knowledge and demonstration be about universal notions to which i fully agree but then it doth not appear to me that those notions be form by abstraction in the manner premise universality so far as i can comprehend not consist in the absolute positive nature or conception of any thing but in the relation it bear to the particulars signify or represent by it by virtue whereof it be that things name or notions be in their own nature particular be render universal thus when i demonstrate any proposition concern triangles it be to be suppose that i have in view the universal idea of a triangle which ought not to be understand as if i could frame an idea of a triangle which be neither equilateral nor scalenon nor equicrural but only that the particular triangle i consider whether of this or that sort it matter not doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever and be in that sense universal all which seem very plain and not to include any difficulty in it but here it will be demand how we can know any proposition to be true of all particular triangles except we have first see it demonstrate of the abstract idea of a triangle which equally agree to all for because a property may be demonstrate to agree to some one particular triangle it will not thence follow that it equally belong to any other triangle which in all respect be not the same with it for example have demonstrate that the three angle of an isosceles rectangular triangle be equal to two right ones i can not therefore conclude this affection agree to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal side it seem therefore that to be certain this proposition be universally true we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular triangle which be impossible or once for all demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle in which all the particulars do indifferently partake and by which they be all equally represent to which i answer that though the idea i have in view whilst i make the demonstration be for instance that of an isosceles rectangular triangle whose side be of a determinate length i may nevertheless be certain it extend to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or bigness soever and that because neither the right angle nor the equality nor determinate length of the side be at all concern in the demonstration it be true the diagram i have in view include all these particulars but then there be not the least mention make of them in the proof of the proposition it be not say the three angle be equal to two right ones because one of them be a right angle or because the side comprehend it be of the same length which sufficiently shew that the right angle might have be oblique and the side unequal and for all that the demonstration have hold good and for this reason it be that i conclude that to be true of any obliquangular or scalenon which i have demonstrate of a particular rightangled equicrural triangle and not because i demonstrate the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle and here it must be acknowledge that a man may consider a figure merely as triangular without attend to the particular qualities of the angle or relations of the side so far he may abstract but this will never prove that he can frame an abstract general inconsistent idea of a triangle in like manner we may consider peter so far forth as man or so far forth as animal without frame the forementioned abstract idea either of man or of animal in as much as all that be perceive be not consider it be an endless as well as an useless thing to trace the schoolmen those great master of abstraction through all the manifold inextricable labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of abstract natures and notions seem to have lead them into what bicker and controversies and what a learn dust have be raise about those matter and what mighty advantage hath be from thence derive to mankind be things at this day too clearly know to need be insist on and it have be well if the ill effect of that doctrine be confine to those only who make the most avow profession of it when men consider the great pain industry and part that have for so many age be lay out on the cultivation and advancement of the sciences and that notwithstanding all this the far greater part of them remain full of darkness and uncertainty and dispute that be like never to have an end and even those that be think to be support by the most clear and cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which be perfectly irreconcilable to the understand of men and that take all together a small portion of them doth supply any real benefit to mankind otherwise than by be an innocent diversion and amusement i say the consideration of all this be apt to throw them into a despondency and perfect contempt of all study but this may perhaps cease upon a view of the false principles that have obtain in the world amongst all which there be none methinks hath a more wide influence over the thoughts of speculative men than this of abstract general ideas i come now to consider the source of this prevail notion and that seem to me to be language and surely nothing of less extent than reason it self could have be the source of an opinion so universally receive the truth of this appear as from other reason so also from the plain confession of the ablest patrons of abstract ideas who acknowledge that they be make in order to name from which it be a clear consequence that if there have be no such thing as speech or universal sign there never have be any think of abstraction see b sect and elsewhere of the essay on human understand let us therefore examine the manner wherein word have contribute to the origin of that mistake first then tis think that every name hath or ought to have one only precise and settle signification which incline men to think there be certain abstract determinate ideas which constitute the true and only immediate signification of each general name and that it be by the mediation of these abstract ideas that a general name come to signify any particular thing whereas in truth there be no such thing as one precise and definite signification annex to any general name they all signify indifferently a great number of particular ideas all which doth evidently follow from what have be already say and will clearly appear to anyone by a little reflexion to this it will be object that every name that have a definition be thereby restrain to one certain signification for example a triangle be define to be a plain surface comprehend by three right line by which that name be limit to denote one certain idea and no other to which i answer that in the definition it be not say whether the surface be great or small black or white nor whether the side be long or short equal or unequal nor with what angle they be incline to each other in all which there may be great variety and consequently there be no one settle idea which limit the signification of the word triangle tis one thing for to keep a name constantly to the same definition and another to make it stand every where for the same idea the one be necessary the other useless and impracticable but to give a farther account how word come to produce the doctrine of abstract ideas it must be observe that it be a receive opinion that language have no other end but the communicate our ideas and that every significant name stand for an idea this be so and it be withal certain that name which yet be not think altogether insignificant do not always mark out particular conceivable ideas it be straightway conclude that they stand for abstract notions that there be many name in use amongst speculative men which do not always suggest to others determinate particular ideas be what no body will deny and a little attention will discover that it be not necessary even in the strictest reason significant name which stand for ideas should every time they be use excite in the understand the ideas they be make to stand for in read and discourse name be for the most part use as letter be in algebra in which though a particular quantity be mark by each letter yet to proceed right it be not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it be appoint to stand for besides the communicate of ideas mark by word be not the chief and only end of language as be commonly suppose there be other end as the raise of some passion the excite to or deter from an action the put the mind in some particular disposition to which the former be in many case barely subservient and sometimes intirely omit when these can be obtain without it as i think doth not unfrequently happen in the familiar use of language i intreat the reader to reflect with himself and see if it doth not often happen either in hear or read a discourse that the passions of fear love hatred admiration disdain and the like arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain word without any ideas come between at first indeed the word might have occasion ideas that be fit to produce those emotions but if i mistake not it will be find that when language be once grow familiar the hear of the sound or sight of the character be oft immediately attend with those passions which at first be wont to be produce by the intervention of ideas that be now quite omit may we not for example be affect with the promise of a good thing though we have not an idea of what it be or be not the be threatned with danger sufficient to excite a dread though we think not of any particular evil likely to befal us nor yet frame to our selves an idea of danger in abstract if any one shall join ever so little reflexion of his own to what have be say i believe it will evidently appear to him that general name be often use in the propriety of language without the speakers design them for mark of ideas in his own which he would have them raise in the mind of the hearer even proper name themselves do not seem always speak with a design to bring into our view the ideas of those individuals that be suppose to be mark by them for example when a schoolman tell me aristotle hath say it all i conceive he mean by it be to dispose me to embrace his opinion with the deference and submission which custom have annex to that name and this effect may be so instantly produce in the mind of those who be accustom to resign their judgment to the authority of that philosopher as it be impossible any idea either of his person write or reputation should go before innumerable examples of this kind may be give but why should i insist on those things which every ones experience will i doubt not plentifully suggest unto him we have i think shew the impossibility of abstract ideas we have consider what have be say for them by their ablest patrons and endeavor to shew they be of no use for those end to which they be think necessary and lastly we have trace them to the source from whence they flow which appear to be language it can not be deny that word be of excellent use in that by their mean all that stock of knowledge which have be purchase by the joint labour of inquisitive men in all age and nations may be draw into the view and make the possession of one single person but at the same time it must be own that most part of knowledge have be strangely perplex and darken by the abuse of word and general ways of speech wherein they be deliver since therefore word be so apt to impose on the understand whatever ideas i consider i shall endeavour to take them bare and naked into my view keep out of my thoughts so far as i be able those name which long and constant use hath so strictly unite with them from which i may expect to derive the follow advantage first i shall be sure to get clear of all controversies purely verbal the spring up of which weed in almost all the sciences have be a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge secondly this seem to be a sure way to extricate my self out of that fine and subtile net of abstract ideas which have so miserably perplex and entangle the mind of men and that with this peculiar circumstance that by how much the finer and more curious be the wit of any man by so much the deeper be he like to be ensnare and faster hold therein thirdly so long as i confine my thoughts to my own ideas divest of word i do not see how i can easily be mistake the object i consider i clearly and adequately know i can not be deceive in think i have an idea which i have not it be not possible for me to imagine that any of my own ideas be alike or unlike that be not truly so to discern the agreements or disagreements there be between my ideas to see what ideas be include in any compound idea and what not there be nothing more requisite than an attentive perception of what pass in my own understand but the attainment of all these advantage doth presuppose an intire deliverance from the deception of word which i dare hardly promise my self so difficult a thing it be to dissolve an union so early begin and confirm by so long a habit as that betwixt word and ideas which difficulty seem to have be very much increase by the doctrine of abstraction for so long as men think abstract ideas be annex to their word it doth not seem strange that they should use word for ideas it be find an impracticable thing to lay aside the word and retain the abstract idea in the mind which in it self be perfectly inconceivable this seem to me the principal cause why those men who have so emphatically recommend to others the lay aside all use of word in their meditations and contemplate their bare ideas have yet fail to perform it themselves of late many have be very sensible of the absurd opinions and insignificant dispute which grow out of the abuse of word and in order to remedy these evils they advise well that we attend to the ideas signify and draw off our attention from the word which signify them but how good soever this advice may be they have give others it be plain they could not have a due regard to it themselves so long as they think the only immediate use of word be to signify ideas and that the immediate signification of every general name be a determinate abstract idea but these be know to be mistake a man may with greater ease prevent his be impose on by word he that know he have no other than particular ideas will not puzzle himself in vain to find out and conceive the abstract idea annex to any name and he that know name do not always stand for ideas will spare himself the labour of look for ideas where there be none to be have it be therefore to be wish that every one would use his utmost endeavour to obtain a clear view of the ideas he would consider separate from them all that dress and incumbrance of word which so much contribute to blind the judgment and divide the attention in vain do we extend our view into the heavens and pry into the entrails of the earth in vain do we consult the write of learn men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity we need only draw the curtain of word to behold the fairest tree of knowledge whose fruit be excellent and within the reach of our hand unless we take care to clear the first principles of knowledge from the embarras and delusion of word we may make infinite reason upon them to no purpose we may draw consequences from consequences and be never the wiser the farther we go we shall only lose our selves the more irrecoverably and be the deeper entangle in difficulties and mistake whoever therefore design to read the follow sheet i intreat him to make my word the occasion of his own think and endeavour to attain the same train of thoughts in read that i have in write them by this mean it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity of what i say he will be out of all danger of be deceive by my word and i do not see how he can be lead into an error by consider his own naked undisguised ideas of the principles of humane knowledge part it be evident to any one who take a survey of the object of humane knowledge that they be either ideas actually imprint on the sense or else such as be perceive by attend to the passions and operations of the mind or lastly ideas form by help of memory and imagination either compound divide or barely represent those originally perceive in the aforesaid ways by sight i have the ideas of light and colour with their several degrees and variations by touch i perceive for example hard and soft heat and cold motion and resistance and of all these more and less either as to quantity or degree smell furnish me with odors the palate with taste and hear convey sound to the mind in all their variety of tone and composition and as several of these be observe to accompany each other they come to be mark by one name and so to be repute as one thing thus for example a certain colour taste smell figure and consistence have be observe to go together be account one distinct thing signify by the name apple other collections of ideas constitute a stone a tree a book and the like sensible things which as they be please or disagreeable excite the passions of love hatred joy grief and so forth but besides all that endless variety of ideas or object of knowledge there be likewise something which know or perceive them and exercise divers operations as will imagine remember about them this perceive active be be what i call mind spirit soul or my self by which word i do not denote any one of my ideas but a thing intirely distinct from them wherein they exist or which be the same thing whereby they be perceive for the existence of an idea consist in be perceive that neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas form by the imagination exist without the mind be what every body will allow and it seem no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprint on the sense however blend or combine together that be whatever object they compose can not exist otherwise than in a mind perceive them i think an intuitive knowledge may be obtain of this by any one that shall attend to what be mean by the term exist when apply to sensible things the table i write on i say exist that be i see and feel it and if i be out of my study i should say it exist mean thereby that if i be in my study i might perceive it or that some other spirit actually do perceive it there be an odor that be it be smell there be a sound that be to say it be hear a colour or figure and it be perceive by sight or touch this be all that i can understand by these and the like expressions for as to what be say of the absolute existence of unthinking things without any relation to their be perceive that seem perfectly unintelligible their esse be percipi nor be it possible they should have any existence out of the mind or think things which perceive them it be indeed an opinion strangely prevail amongst men that house mountains rivers and in a word all sensible object have an existence natural or real distinct from their be perceive by the understand but with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertain in the world yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may if i mistake not perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction for what be the forementioned object but the things we perceive by sense and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations and be it not plainly repugnant that any one of these or any combination of them should exist unperceived if we thoroughly examine this tenet it will perhaps be find at bottom to depend on the doctrine of abstract ideas for can there be a nicer strain of abstraction than to distinguish the existence of sensible object from their be perceive so as to conceive them exist unperceived light and colour heat and cold extension and figure in a word the things we see and feel what be they but so many sensations notions ideas or impressions on the sense and be it possible to separate even in think any of these from perception for my part i might as easily divide a thing from it self i may indeed divide in my thoughts or conceive apart from each other those things which perhaps i never perceive by sense so divide thus i imagine the trunk of a humane body without the limbs or conceive the smell of a rise without think on the rise it self so far i will not deny i can abstract if that may properly be call abstraction which extend only to the conceive separately such object as it be possible may really exist or be actually perceive asunder but my conceive or imagine power do not extend beyond the possibility of real existence or perception hence as it be impossible for me to see or feel any thing without an actual sensation of that thing so be it impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it some truths there be so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eye to see them such i take this important one to be to wit that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth in a word all those body which compose the mighty frame of the world have not any subsistence without a mind that their be be to be perceive or know that consequently so long as they be not actually perceive by me or do not exist in my mind or that of any other create spirit they must either have no existence at all or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit it be perfectly unintelligible and involve all the absurdity of abstraction to attribute to any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit to be convince of which the reader need only reflect and try to separate in his own thoughts the be of a sensible thing from its be perceive from what have be say it follow there be not any other substance than spirit or that which perceive but for the fuller proof of this point let it be consider the sensible qualities be colour figure motion smell taste and such like that be the ideas perceive by sense now for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing be a manifest contradiction for to have an idea be all one as to perceive that therefore wherein colour figure and the like qualities exist must perceive them hence it be clear there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas but say you though the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind yet there may be things like them whereof they be copy or resemblances which things exist without the mind in an unthinking substance i answer an idea can be like nothing but an idea a colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure if we look but ever so little into our thoughts we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a liken except only between our ideas again i ask whether those suppose originals or external things of which our ideas be the picture or representations be themselves perceivable or no if they be then they be ideas and we have gain our point but if you say they be not i appeal to any one whether it be sense to assert a colour be like something which be invisible hard or soft like something which be intangible and so of the rest some there be who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities by the former they mean extension figure motion rest solidity or impenetrability and number by the latter they denote all other sensible qualities as colour sound taste and so forth the ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of any thing exist without the mind or unperceived but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be pattern or image of things which exist without the mind in an unthinking substance which they call matter by matter therefore we be to understand an inert senseless substance in which extension figure and motion do actually subsist but it be evident from what we have already shew that extension figure and motion be only ideas exist in the mind and that an idea can be like nothing but another idea and that consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance hence it be plain that that the very notion of what be call matter or corporeal substance involve a contradiction in it they who assert that figure motion and the rest of the primary or original qualities do exist without the mind in unthinking substances do at the same time acknowledge that colour sound heat cold and suchlike secondary qualities do not which they tell us be sensations exist in the mind alone that depend on and be occasion by the different size texture and motion of the minute particles of matter this they take for an undoubted truth which they can demonstrate beyond all exception now if it be certain that those original qualities be inseparably unite with the other sensible qualities and not even in think capable of be abstract from them it plainly follow that they exist only in the mind but i desire any one to reflect and try whether he can by any abstraction of think conceive the extension and motion of a body without all other sensible qualities for my own part i see evidently that it be not in my power to frame an idea of a body extend and move but i must withal give it some colour or other sensible quality which be acknowledge to exist only in the mind in short extension figure and motion abstract from all other qualities be inconceivable where therefore the other sensible qualities be there must these be also to wit in the mind and no where else again great and small swift and slow be allow to exist no where without the mind be intirely relative and change as the frame or position of the organs of sense vary the extension therefore which exist without the mind be neither great nor small the motion neither swift nor slow that be they be nothing at all but say you they be extension in general and motion in general thus we see how much the tenet of extend moveable substances exist without the mind depend on that strange doctrine of abstract ideas and here i can not but remark how nearly the vague and indeterminate description of matter or corporeal substance which the modern philosophers be run into by their own principles resemble that antiquate and so much ridicule notion of materia prima to be meet with in aristotle and his followers without extension solidity can not be conceive since therefore it have be shew that extension exist not in an unthinking substance the same must also be true of solidity that number be intirely the creature of the mind even though the other qualities be allow to exist without will be evident to whoever consider that the same thing bear a different denomination of number as the mind view it with different respect thus the same extension be one or three or thirty six accord as the mind consider it with reference to a yard a foot or an inch number be so visibly relative and dependent on mens understand that it be strange to think how any one should give it an absolute existence without the mind we say one book one page one line all these be equally unite though some contain several of the others and in each instance it be plain the unite relate to some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put together by the mind unity i know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded idea accompany all other ideas into the mind that i have any such idea answer the word unity i do not find and if i have methinks i could not miss find it on the contrary it should be the most familiar to my understand since it be say to accompany all other ideas and to be perceive by all the ways of sensation and reflexion to say no more it be an abstract idea i shall farther add that after the same manner as modern philosophers prove certain sensible qualities to have no existence in matter or without the mind the same thing may be likewise prove of all other sensible qualities whatsoever thus for instance it be say that heat and cold be affections only of the mind and not at all pattern of real be exist in the corporeal substances which excite them for that the same body which appear cold to one hand seem warm to another now why may we not as well argue that figure and extension be not pattern or resemblances of qualities exist in matter because to the same eye at different station or eye of a different texture at the same station they appear various and can not therefore be the image of any thing settle and determinate without the mind again it be prove that sweetness be not really in the sapid thing because the thing remain unaltered the sweetness be change into bitter as in case of a fever or otherwise vitiate palate be it not as reasonable to say that motion be not without the mind since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter the motion it be acknowledge shall appear slower without any alteration in any external object in short let any one consider those arguments which be think manifestly to prove that colour and taste exist only in the mind and he shall find they may with equal force be bring to prove the same thing of extension figure and motion though it must be confess this method of argue doth not so much prove that there be no extension or colour in an outward object as that we do not know by sense which be the true extension or colour of the object but the arguments forego plainly shew it to be impossible that any colour or extension at all or other sensible quality whatsoever should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind or in truth that there should be any such thing as an outward object but let us examine a little the receive opinion it be say extension be a mode or accident of matter and that matter be the substratum that support it now i desire that you would explain what be mean by matter support extension say you i have no idea of matter and therefore can not explain it i answer though you have no positive yet if you have any mean at all you must at least have a relative idea of matter though you know not what it be yet you must be suppose to know what relation it bear to accidents and what be mean by its support them it be evident support can not here be take in its usual or literal sense as when we say that pillars support a build in what sense therefore must it be take if we inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare themselves to mean by material substance we shall find them acknowledge they have no other mean annex to those sound but the idea of be in general together with the relative notion of its support accidents the general idea of be appeareth to me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other and as for its support accidents this as we have just now observe can not be understand in the common sense of those word it must therefore be take in some other sense but what that be they do not explain so that when i consider the two part or branch which make the signification of the word material substance i be convince there be no distinct mean annex to them but why should we trouble our selves any farther in discuss this material substratum or support of figure and motion and other sensible qualities do it not suppose they have an existence without the mind and be not this a direct repugnancy and altogether inconceivable but though it be possible that solid figure moveable substances may exist without the mind correspond to the ideas we have of body yet how be it possible for us to know this either we must know it by sense or by reason as for our sense by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations ideas or those things that be immediately perceive by sense call them what you will but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind or unperceived like to those which be perceive this the materialists themselves acknowledge it remain therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things it must be by reason infer their existence from what be immediately perceive by sense but what reason can induce us to believe the existence of body without the mind from what we perceive since the very patrons of matter themselves do not pretend there be any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas i say it be grant on all hand and what happen in dream phrensies and the like put it beyond dispute that it be possible we might be affect with all the ideas we have now though no body exist without resemble them hence it be evident the supposition of external body be not necessary for the produce our ideas since it be grant they be produce sometimes and might possibly be produce always in the same order we see them in at present without their concurrence but though we might possibly have all our sensations without them yet perhaps it may be think easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production by suppose external body in their liken rather than otherwise and so it might be at least probable there be such things as body that excite their ideas in our mind but neither can this be say for though we give the materialists their external body they by their own confession be never the nearer know how our ideas be produce since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit or how it be possible it should imprint any idea in the mind hence it be evident the production of ideas or sensations in our mind can be no reason why we should suppose matter or corporeal substances since that be acknowledge to remain equally inexplicable with or without this supposition if therefore it be possible for body to exist without the mind yet to hold they do so must need be a very precarious opinion since it be to suppose without any reason at all that god have create innumerable be that be intirely useless and serve to no manner of purpose in short if there be external body it be impossible we should ever come to know it and if there be not we might have the very same reason to think there be that we have now suppose what no one can deny possible an intelligence without the help of external body to be affect with the same train of sensations or ideas that you be imprint in the same order and with like vividness in his mind i ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances represent by his ideas and excite them in his mind that you can possibly have for believe the same thing of this there can be no question which one consideration be enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever arguments be may think himself to have for the existence of body without the mind be it necessary to add any farther proof against the existence of matter after what have be say i could instance several of those errors and difficulties not to mention impieties which have spring from that tenet it have occasion numberless controversies and dispute in philosophy and not a few of far greater moment in religion but i shall not enter into the detail of them in this place as well because i think arguments a posteriori be unnecessary for confirm what have be if i mistake not sufficiently demonstrate a priori as because i shall hereafter find occasion to say somewhat of them i be afraid i have give cause to think me needlesly prolix in handle this subject for to what purpose be it to dilate on that which may be demonstrate with the utmost evidence in a line or two to any one that be capable of the least reflexion it be but look into your own thoughts and so try whether you can conceive it possible for a sound or figure or motion or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived this easy trial may make you see that what you contend for be a downright contradiction insomuch that i be content to put the whole upon this issue if you can but conceive it possible for one extend moveable substance or in general for any one idea or any thing like an idea to exist otherwise than in a mind perceive it i shall readily give up the cause and as for all that compages of external body which you contend for i shall grant you its existence though you can not either give me any reason why you believe it exist or assign any use to it when it be suppose to exist i say the bare possibility of your opinions be true shall pass for an argument that it be so but say you surely there be nothing easier than to imagine tree for instance in a park or book exist in a closet and no body by to perceive them i answer you may so there be no difficulty in it but what be all this i beseech you more than frame in your mind certain ideas which you call book and tree and the same time omit to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them but do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while this therefore be nothing to the purpose it only shew you have the power of imagine or form ideas in your mind but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible the object of your think may exist without the mind to make out this it be necessary that you conceive them exist unconceived or unthought of which be a manifest repugnancy when we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external body we be all the while only contemplate our own ideas but the mind take no notice of it self be delude to think it can and doth conceive body exist unthought of or without the mind though at the same time they be apprehend by or exist in it self a little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what be here say and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proof against the existence of material substance it be very obvious upon the least inquiry into our own thoughts to know whether it be possible for us to understand what be mean by the absolute existence of sensible object in themselves or without the mind to me it be evident those word mark out either a direct contradiction or else nothing at all and to convince others of this i know no readier or fairer way than to intreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions do appear surely nothing more be requisite for their conviction it be on this therefore that i insist to wit that the absolute existence of unthinking things be word without a mean or which include a contradiction this be what i repeat and inculcate and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader all our ideas sensations or the things which we perceive by whatsoever name they may be distinguish be visibly inactive there be nothing of power or agency include in them so that one idea or object of think can not produce or make any alteration in another to be satisfy of the truth of this there be nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas for since they and every part of them exist only in the mind it follow that there be nothing in them but what be perceive but whoever shall attend to his ideas whether of sense or reflexion will not perceive in them any power or activity there be therefore no such thing contain in them a little attention will discover to us that the very be of an idea imply passiveness and inertness in it insomuch that it be impossible for an idea to do any thing or strictly speak to be the cause of any thing neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active be as be evident from sect whence it plainly follow that extension figure and motion can not be the cause of our sensations to say therefore that these be the effect of power result from the configuration number motion and size of corpuscles must certainly be false we perceive a continual succession of ideas some be anew excite others be change or totally disappear there be therefore some cause of these ideas whereon they depend and which produce and change them that this cause can not be any quality or idea or combination of ideas be clear from the precede section it must therefore be a substance but it have be shew that there be no corporeal or material substance it remain therefore that the cause of ideas be an incorporeal active substance or spirit a spirit be one simple undivided active be as it perceive ideas it be call the understand and as it produce or otherwise operate about them it be call the will hence there can be no idea form of a soul or spirit for all ideas whatever be passive and inert vide sect they can not represent unto us by way of image or liken that which act a little attention will make it plain to any one that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas be absolutely impossible such be the nature of spirit or that which act that it can not be of it self perceive but only by the effect which it produceth if any man shall doubt of the truth of what be here deliver let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active be and whether he hath ideas of two principal power mark by the name will and understand distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of substance or be in general with a relative notion of its support or be the subject of the aforesaid power which be signify by the name soul or spirit this be what some hold but so far as i can see the word will soul spirit do not stand for different ideas or in truth for any idea at all but for something which be very different from ideas and which be an agent can not be like unto or represent by any idea whatsoever though it must be own at the same time that we have some notion of soul spirit and the operations of the mind such as will love hat in as much as we know or understand the mean of those word i find i can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure and vary and shift the scene as oft as i think fit it be no more than will and straightway this or that idea arise in my fancy and by the same power it be obliterate and make way for another this make and unmake of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active thus much be certain and ground on experience but when we think of unthinking agents or of excite ideas exclusive of volition we only amuse our selves with word but whatever power i may have over my own thoughts i find the ideas actually perceive by sense have not a like dependence on my will when in broad daylight i open my eye it be not in my power to choose whether i shall see or no or to determine what particular object shall present themselves to my view and so likewise as to the hear and other sense the ideas imprint on them be not creatures of my will there be therefore some other will or spirit that produce them the ideas of sense be more strong lively and distinct than those of the imagination they have likewise a steddiness order and coherence and be not excite at random as those which be the effect of humane will often be but in a regular train or series the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testify the wisdom and benevolence of its author now the set rule or establish methods wherein the mind we depend on excite in us the ideas of sense be call the laws of nature and these we learn by experience which teach us that such and such ideas be attend with such and such other ideas in the ordinary course of things this give us a sort of foresight which enable us to regulate our action for the benefit of life and without this we should be eternally at a loss we could not know how to act any thing that might procure us the least pleasure or remove the least pain of sense that food nourish sleep refresh and fire warm us that to sow in the seedtime be the way to reap in the harvest and in general that to obtain such or such end such or such mean be conducive all this we know not by discover any necessary connexion between our ideas but only by the observation of the settle laws of nature without which we should be all in uncertainty and confusion and a grow man no more know how to manage himself in the affairs of life than an infant just bear and yet this consistent uniform work which so evidently display the goodness and wisdom of that govern spirit whose will constitute the laws of nature be so far from lead our thoughts to him that it rather send them a wander after second cause for when we perceive certain ideas of sense constantly follow by other ideas and we know this be not of our own do we forthwith attribute power and agency to the ideas themselves and make one the cause of another than which nothing can be more absurd and unintelligible thus for example have observe that when we perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure we at the same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation call heat we do from thence conclude the sun to be the cause of heat and in like manner perceive the motion and collision of body to be attend with sound we be incline to think the latter an effect of the former the ideas imprint on the sense by the author of nature be call real things and those excite in the imagination be less regular vivid and constant be more properly term ideas or image of things which they copy and represent but then our sensations be they never so vivid and distinct be nevertheless ideas that be they exist in the mind or be perceive by it as truly as the ideas of its own frame the ideas of sense be allow to have more reality in them that be to be more strong orderly and coherent than the creatures of the mind but this be no argument that they exist without the mind they be also less dependent on the spirit or think substance which perceive them in that they be excite by the will of another and more powerful spirit yet still they be ideas and certainly no idea whether faint or strong can exist otherwise than in a mind perceive it before we proceed any farther it be necessary to spend some time in answer objections which may probably be make against the principles hitherto lay down in do of which if i seem too prolix to those of quick apprehensions i hope it may be pardon since all men do not equally apprehend things of this nature and i be will to be understand by every one first then it will be object that by the forego principles all that be real and substantial in nature be banish out of the world and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas take place all things that exist exist only in the mind that be they be purely notional what therefore become of the sun moon and star what must we think of house rivers mountains tree stone nay even of our own body be all these but so many chimeras and illusions on the fancy to all which and whatever else of the same sort may be object i answer that by the principles premise we be not deprive of any one thing in nature whatever we see feel hear or any wise conceive or understand remain as secure as ever and be as real as ever there be a rerum natura and the distinction between realities and chimeras retain its full force this be evident from sect and where we have shew what be mean by real things in opposition to chimeras or ideas of our own frame but then they both equally exist in the mind and in that sense they be alike ideas i do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend either by sense or reflexion that the things i see with mine eye and touch with my hand do exist really exist i make not the least question the only thing whose existence we deny be that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance and in do of this there be no damage do to the rest of mankind who i dare say will never miss it the atheist indeed will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety and the philosophers may possibly find they have lose a great handle for trifle and disputation if any man think this detract from the existence or reality of things he be very far from understand what hath be premise in the plainest term i could think of take here an abstract of what have be say there be spiritual substances mind or humane souls which will or excite ideas in themselves at pleasure but these be faint weak and unsteady in respect of others they perceive by sense which be impress upon them accord to certain rule or laws of nature speak themselves the effect of a mind more powerful and wise than humane spirit these latter be say to have more reality in them than the former by which be mean that they be more affect orderly and distinct and that they be not fictions of the mind perceive them and in this sense the sun that i see by day be the real sun and that which i imagine by night be the idea of the former in the sense here give of reality it be evident that every vegetable star mineral and in general each part of the mundane system be as much a real be by our principles as by any other whether others mean any thing by the term reality different from what i do i intreat them to look into their own thoughts and see it will be urge that thus much at least be true to wit that we take away all corporeal substances to this my answer be that if the word substance be take in the vulgar sense for a combination of sensible qualities such as extension solidity weight and the like this we can not be accuse of take away but if it be take in a philosophic sense for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind then indeed i acknowledge that we take it away if one may be say to take away that which never have any existence not even in the imagination but say you it sound very harsh to say we eat and drink ideas and be clothe with ideas i acknowledge it do so the word idea not be use in common discourse to signify the several combinations of sensible qualities which be call things and it be certain that any expression which vary from the familiar use of language will seem harsh and ridiculous but this doth not concern the truth of the proposition which in other word be no more than to say we be feed and clothe with those things which we perceive immediately by our sense the hardness or softness the colour taste warmth figure and such like qualities which combine together constitute the several sort of victual and apparel have be shew to exist only in the mind that perceive them and this be all that be mean by call them ideas which word if it be as ordinarily use as thing would sound no harsher nor more ridiculous than it i be not for dispute about the propriety but the truth of the expression if therefore you agree with me that we eat and drink and be clothe with the immediate object of sense which can not exist unperceived or without the mind i shall readily grant it be more proper or conformable to custom that they should be call things rather than ideas if it be demand why i make use of the word idea and do not rather in compliance with custom call them things i answer i do it for two reason first because the term thing in contradistinction to idea be generally suppose to denote somewhat exist without the mind secondly because thing hath a more comprehensive signification than idea include spirit or think things as well as ideas since therefore the object of sense exist only in the mind and be withal thoughtless and inactive i choose to mark them by the word idea which imply those properties but say what we can some one perhaps may be apt to reply he will still believe his sense and never suffer any arguments how plausible soever to prevail over the certainty of them be it so assert the evidence of sense as high as you please we be will to do the same that what i see hear and feel doth exist that be to say be perceive by me i no more doubt than i do of my own be but i do not see how the testimony of sense can be alledged as a proof for the existence of any thing which be not perceive by sense we be not for have any man turn sceptic and disbelieve his sense on the contrary we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable nor be there any principles more opposite to scepticism than those we have lay down as shall be hereafter clearly shew secondly it will be object that there be a great difference betwixt real fire for instance and the idea of fire betwixt dream or imagine ones self burn and actually be so this and the like may be urge in opposition to our tenets to all which the answer be evident from what hath be already say and i shall only add in this place that if real fire be very different from the idea of fire so also be the real pain that it occasion very different from the idea of the same pain and yet no body will pretend that real pain either be or can possibly be in an unperceiving thing or without the mind any more than its idea thirdly it will be object that we see things actually without or at distance from us and which consequently do not exist in the mind it be absurd that those things which be see at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts in answer to this i desire it may be consider that in a dream we do oft perceive things as exist at a great distance off and yet for all that those things be acknowledge to have their existence only in the mind but for the fuller clear of this point it may be worth while to consider how it be that we perceive distance and things place at a distance by sight for that we should in truth see external space and body actually exist in it some nearer others farther off seem to carry with it some opposition to what hath be say of their exist no where without the mind the consideration of this difficulty it be that give birth to my essay towards a new theory of vision which be publish not long since wherein it be shew that distance or outness be neither immediately of it self perceive by sight nor yet apprehend or judge of by line and angle or any thing that hath a necessary connexion with it but that it be only suggest to our thoughts by certain visible ideas and sensations attend vision which in their own nature have no manner of similitude or relation either with distance or things place at a distance but by a connexion teach us by experience they come to signify and suggest them to us after the same manner that word of any language suggest the ideas they be make to stand for insomuch that a man bear blind and afterwards make to see would not at first sight think the things he saw to be without his mind or at any distance from him see sect of the forementioned treatise the ideas of sight and touch make two species intirely distinct and heterogeneous the former be mark and prognostics of the latter that the proper object of sight neither exist without the mind nor be the image of external things be shew even in that treatise though throughout the same the contrary be suppose true of tangible object not that to suppose that vulgar error be necessary for establish the notion therein lay down but because it be beside my purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concern vision so that in strict truth the ideas of sight when we apprehend by them distance and things place at a distance do not suggest or mark out to us things actually exist at a distance but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprint in our mind at such and such distance of time and in consequence of such or such action it be i say evident from what have be say in the forego part of this treatise and in sect and elsewhere of the essay concern vision that visible ideas be the language whereby the govern spirit on whom we depend inform us what tangible ideas he be about to imprint upon us in case we excite this or that motion in our own body but for a fuller information in this point i refer to the essay it self fourthly it will be object that from the forego principles it follow things be every moment annihilate and create anew the object of sense exist only when they be perceive the tree therefore be in the garden or the chair in the parlour no longer than while there be some body by to perceive them upon shut my eye all the furniture in the room be reduce to nothing and barely upon open them it be again create in answer to all which i refer the reader to what have be say in sect c and desire he will consider whether he mean any thing by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its be perceive for my part after the nicest inquiry i could make i be not able to discover that any thing else be mean by those word and i once more intreat the reader to sound his own thoughts and not suffer himself to be impose on by word if he can conceive it possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without be perceive then i give up the cause but if he can not he will acknowledge it be unreasonable for him to stand up in defence of he know not what and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity the not assent to those proposition which at bottom have no mean in them it will not be amiss to observe how far the receive principles of philosophy be themselves chargeable with those pretend absurdities it be think strangely absurd that upon close my eyelids all the visible object round me should be reduce to nothing and yet be not this what philosophers commonly acknowledge when they agree on all hand that light and colour which alone be the proper and immediate object of sight be mere sensations that exist no longer than they be perceive again it may to some perhaps seem very incredible that things should be every moment create yet this very notion be commonly teach in the school for the schoolmen though they acknowledge the existence of matter and that the whole mundane fabrick be frame out of it be nevertheless of opinion that it can not subsist without the divine conservation which by them be expound to be a continual creation farther a little think will discover to us that though we allow the existence of matter or corporeal substance yet it will unavoidably follow from the principles which be now generally admit that the particular body of what kind soever do none of them exist whilst they be not perceive for it be evident from sect and the follow section that the matter philosophers contend for be an incomprehensible somewhat which hath none of those particular qualities whereby the body fall under our sense be distinguish one from another but to make this more plain it must be remark that the infinite divisibility of matter be now universally allow at least by the most approve and considerable philosophers who on the receive principles demonstrate it beyond all exception hence it follow that there be an infinite number of part in each particle of matter which be not perceive by sense the reason therefore that any particular body seem to be of a finite magnitude or exhibit only a finite number of part to sense be not because it contain no more since in itself it contain an infinite number of part but because the sense be not acute enough to discern them in proportion therefore as the sense be render more acute it perceive a greater number of part in the object that be the object appear greater and its figure vary those part in its extremities which be before unperceivable appear now to bind it in very different line and angle from those perceive by an obtuser sense and at length after various change of size and shape when the sense become infinitely acute the body shall seem infinite during all which there be no alteration in the body but only in the sense each body therefore consider in it self be infinitely extend and consequently void of all shape or figure from which it follow that though we should grant the existence of matter to be ever so certain yet it be withal as certain the materialists themselves be by their own principles force to acknowledge that neither the particular body perceive by sense nor any thing like them exist without the mind matter i say and each particle thereof be accord to them infinite and shapeless and it be the mind that frame all that variety of body which compose the visible world any one whereof do not exist longer than it be perceive if we consider it the objection propose in sect will not be find reasonably charge on the principles we have premise so as in truth to make any objection at all against our notions for though we hold indeed the object of sense to be nothing else but ideas which can not exist unperceived yet we may not hence conclude they have no existence except only while they be perceive by us since there may be some other spirit that perceive them though we do not wherever body be say to have no existence without the mind i would not be understand to mean this or that particular mind but all mind whatsoever it do not therefore follow from the forego principles that body be annihilate and create every moment or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception of them fifthly it may perhaps be object that if extension and figure exist only in the mind it follow that the mind be extend and figure since extension be a mode or attribute which to speak with the school be predicate of the subject in which it exist i answer those qualities be in the mind only as they be perceive by it that be not by way of mode or attribute but only by way of idea and it no more follow that the soul or mind be extend because extension exist in it alone than it do that it be red or blue because those colour be on all hand acknowledge to exist in it and no where else as to what philosophers say of subject and mode that seem very groundless and unintelligible for instance in this proposition a die be hard extend and square they will have it that the word die denote a subject or substance distinct from the hardness extension and figure which be predicate of it and in which they exist this i can not comprehend to me a die seem to be nothing distinct from those things which be term its modes or accidents and to say a die be hard extend and square be not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and support them but only an explication of the mean of the word die sixthly you will say there have be a great many things explain by matter and motion take away these and you destroy the whole corpuscular philosophy and undermine those mechanical principles which have be apply with so much success to account for the phænomena in short whatever advance have be make either by ancient or modern philosophers in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition that corporeal substance or matter doth really exist to this i answer that there be not any one phænomenon explain on that supposition which may not as well be explain without it as might easily be make appear by an induction of particulars to explain the phænomena be all one as to shew why upon such and such occasion we be affect with such and such ideas but how matter should operate on a spirit or produce any idea in it be what no philosopher will pretend to explain it be therefore evident there can be no use of matter in natural philosophy besides they who attempt to account for things do it not by corporeal substance but by figure motion and other qualities which be in truth no more than mere ideas and therefore can not be the cause of any thing as hath be already shew see sect seventhly it will upon this be demand whether it do not seem absurd to take away natural cause and ascribe every thing to the immediate operation of spirit we must no longer say upon these principles that fire heat or water cool but that a spirit heat and so forth would not a man be deservedly laught at who should talk after this manner i answer he would so in such things we ought to think with the learn and speak with the vulgar they who to demonstration be convince of the truth of the copernican system do nevertheless say the sun rise the sun set or come to the meridian and if they affect a contrary stile in common talk it would without doubt appear very ridiculous a little reflexion on what be here say will make it manifest that the common use of language would receive no manner of alteration or disturbance from the admission of our tenets in the ordinary affairs of life any phrase may be retain so long as they excite in us proper sentiments or dispositions to act in such a manner as be necessary for our wellbeing how false soever they may be if take in a strict and speculative sense nay this be unavoidable since propriety be regulate by custom language be suit to the receive opinions which be not always the truest hence it be impossible even in the most rigid philosophic reason so far to alter the bend and genius of the tongue we speak as never to give a handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsistencies but a fair and ingenuous reader will collect the sense from the scope and tenor and connexion of a discourse make allowance for those inaccurate modes of speech which use have make inevitable as to the opinion that there be no corporeal cause this have be heretofore maintain by some of the schoolmen as it be of late by others among the modern philosophers who though they allow matter to exist yet will have god alone to be the immediate efficient cause of all things these men saw that amongst all the object of sense there be none which have any power or activity include in it and that by consequence this be likewise true of whatever body they suppose to exist without the mind like unto the immediate object of sense but then that they should suppose an innumerable multitude of create be which they acknowledge be not capable of produce any one effect in nature and which therefore be make to no manner of purpose since god might have do every thing as well without them this i say though we should allow it possible must yet be a very unaccountable and extravagant supposition in the eighth place the universal concurrent assent of mankind may be think by some an invincible argument in behalf of matter or the existence of external things must we suppose the whole world to be mistake and if so what cause can be assign of so widespread and predominant an error i answer first that upon a narrow inquiry it will not perhaps be find so many as be imagine do really believe the existence of matter or things without the mind strictly speak to believe that which involve a contradiction or have no mean in it be impossible and whether the forego expressions be not of that sort i refer it to the impartial examination of the reader in one sense indeed men may be say to believe that matter exist that be they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations which affect them every moment and be so nearly present to them be some senseless unthinking be but that they should clearly apprehend any mean mark by those word and form thereof a settle speculative opinion be what i be not able to conceive this be not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves by imagine they believe those proposition they have often hear though at bottom they have no mean in them but secondly though we should grant a notion to be ever so universally and stedfastly adhere to yet this be but a weak argument of its truth to whoever consider what a vast number of prejudice and false opinions be every where embrace with the utmost tenaciousness by the unreflecting which be the far greater part of mankind there be a time when the antipodes and motion of the earth be look upon as monstrous absurdities even by men of learn and if it be consider what a small proportion they bear to the rest of mankind we shall find that at this day those notions have gain but a very inconsiderable foot in the world but it be demand that we assign a cause of this prejudice and account for its obtain in the world to this i answer that men know they perceive several ideas whereof they themselves be not the author as not be excite from within nor depend on the operation of their will this make them maintain those ideas or object of perception have an existence independent of and without the mind without ever dream that a contradiction be involve in those word but philosophers have plainly see that the immediate object of perception do not exist without the mind they in some degree correct the mistake of the vulgar but at the same time run into another which seem no less absurd to wit that there be certain object really exist without the mind or have a subsistence distinct from be perceive of which our ideas be only image or resemblances imprint by those object on the mind and this notion of the philosophers owe its origin to the same cause with the former namely their be conscious that they be not the author of their own sensations which they evidently know be imprint from without and which therefore must have some cause distinct from the mind on which they be imprint but why they should suppose the ideas of sense to be excite in us by things in their liken and not rather have recourse to spirit which alone can act may be account for first because they be not aware of the repugnancy there be as well in suppose things like unto our ideas exist without as in attribute to them power or activity secondly because the supreme spirit which excite those ideas in our mind be not mark out and limit to our view by any particular finite collection of sensible ideas as humane agents be by their size complexion limbs and motion and thirdly because his operations be regular and uniform whenever the course of nature be interrupt by a miracle men be ready to own the presence of a superior agent but when we see things go on in the ordinary course they do not excite in us any reflexion their order and concatenation though it be an argument of the greatest wisdom power and goodness in their creator be yet so constant and familiar to us that we do not think them the immediate effect of a free spirit especially since inconstancy and mutability in act though it be an imperfection be look on as a mark of freedom tenthly it will be object that the notions we advance be inconsistent with several sound truths in philosophy and mathematicks for example the motion of the earth be now universally admit by astronomers as a truth ground on the clearest and most convince reason but on the forego principles there can be no such thing for motion be only an idea it follow that if it be not perceive it exist not but the motion of the earth be not perceive by sense i answer that tenet if rightly understand will be find to agree with the principles we have premise for the question whether the earth move or no amount in reality to no more than this to wit whether we have reason to conclude from what hath be observe by astronomers that if we be place in such and such circumstances and such or such a position and distance both from the earth and sun we should perceive the former to move among the choir of the planets and appear in all respect like one of them and this by the establish rule of nature which we have no reason to mistrust be reasonably collect from the phænomena we may from the experience we have have of the train and succession of ideas in our mind often make i will not say uncertain conjecture but sure and wellgrounded predictions concern the ideas we shall be affect with pursuant to a great train of action and be enable to pass a right judgment of what would have appear to us in case we be place in circumstances very different from those we be in at present herein consist the knowledge of nature which may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath be say it will be easy to apply this to whatever objections of the like sort may be draw from the magnitude of the star or any other discoveries in astronomy or nature in the eleventh place it will be demand to what purpose serve that curious organization of plant and the admirable mechanism in the part of animals might not vegetables grow and shoot forth leave and blossom and animals perform all their motion as well without as with all that variety of internal part so elegantly contrive and put together which be ideas have nothing powerful or operative in them nor have any necessary connexion with the effect ascribe to them if it be a spirit that immediately produce every effect by a fiat or act of his will we must think all that be fine and artificial in the work whether of man or nature to be make in vain by this doctrine though an artist hath make the spring and wheel and every movement of a watch and adjust them in such a manner as he know would produce the motion he design yet he must think all this do to no purpose and that it be an intelligence which direct the index and point to the hour of the day if so why may not the intelligence do it without his be at the pain of make the movements and put them together why do not an empty case serve as well as another and how come it to pass that whenever there be any fault in the go of a watch there be some correspond disorder to be find in the movements which be mend by a skilful hand all be right again the like may be say of all the clockwork of nature great part whereof be so wonderfully fine and subtile as scarce to be discern by the best microscope in short it will be ask how upon our principles any tolerable account can be give or any final cause assign of an innumerable multitude of body and machine frame with the most exquisite art which in the common philosophy have very apposite use assign them and serve to explain abundance of phænomena to all which i answer first that though there be some difficulties relate to the administration of providence and the use by it assign to the several part of nature which i could not solve by the forego principles yet this objection could be of small weight against the truth and certainty of those things which may be prove a priori with the utmost evidence secondly but neither be the receive principles free from the like difficulties for it may still be demand to what end god should take those roundabout methods of effect things by instrument and machine which no one can deny might have be effect by the mere command of his will without all that apparatus nay if we narrowly consider it we shall find the objection may be retort with greater force on those who hold the existence of those machine without the mind for it have be make evident that solidity bulk figure motion and the like have no activity or efficacy in them so as to be capable of produce any one effect in nature see sect whoever therefore suppose them to exist allow the supposition possible when they be not perceive do it manifestly to no purpose since the only use that be assign to them as they exist unperceived be that they produce those perceivable effect which in truth can not be ascribe to any thing but spirit but to come nearer the difficulty it must be observe that though the fabrication of all those part and organs be not absolutely necessary to the produce any effect yet it be necessary to the produce of things in a constant regular way accord to the laws of nature there be certain general laws that run through the whole chain of natural effect these be learn by the observation and study of nature and be by men apply as well to the frame artificial things for the use and ornament of life as to the explain the various phænomena which explication consist only in shew the conformity any particular phænomenon hath to the general laws of nature or which be the same thing in discover the uniformity there be in the production of natural effect as will be evident to whoever shall attend to the several instance wherein philosophers pretend to account for appearances that there be a great and conspicuous use in these regular constant methods of work observe by the supreme agent hath be shew in sect and it be no less visible that a particular size figure motion and disposition of part be necessary though not absolutely to the produce any effect yet to the produce it accord to the stand mechanical laws of nature thus for instance it can not be deny that god or the intelligence which sustain and rule the ordinary course of things might if he be mind to produce a miracle cause all the motion on the dialplate of a watch though no body have ever make the movements and put them in it but yet if he will act agreeably to the rule of mechanism by him for wise end establish and maintain in the creation it be necessary that those action of the watchmaker whereby he make the movements and rightly adjust them precede the production of the aforesaid motion as also that any disorder in them be attend with the perception of some correspond disorder in the movements which be once correct all be right again it may indeed on some occasion be necessary that the author of nature display his overrule power in produce some appearance out of the ordinary series of things such exceptions from the general rule of nature be proper to surprise and awe men into an acknowledgment of the divine be but then they be to be use but seldom otherwise there be a plain reason why they should fail of that effect besides god seem to choose the convince our reason of his attribute by the work of nature which discover so much harmony and contrivance in their make and be such plain indications of wisdom and beneficence in their author rather than to astonish us into a belief of his be by anomalous and surprise events to set this matter in a yet clearer light i shall observe that what have be object in sect amount in reality to no more than this ideas be not any how and at random produce there be a certain order and connexion between them like to that of cause and effect there be also several combinations of them make in a very regular and artificial manner which seem like so many instrument in the hand of nature that be hide as it be behind the scenes have a secret operation in produce those appearances which be see on the theatre of the world be themselves discernible only to the curious eye of the philosopher but since one idea can not be the cause of another to what purpose be that connexion and since those instrument be barely inefficacious perceptions in the mind be not subservient to the production of natural effect it be demand why they be make or in other word what reason can be assign why god should make us upon a close inspection into his work behold so great variety of ideas so artfully lay together and so much accord to rule it not be credible that he would be at the expense if one may so speak of all that art and regularity to no purpose to all which my answer be first that the connexion of ideas do not imply the relation of cause and effect but only of a mark or sign with the thing signify the fire which i see be not the cause of the pain i suffer upon my approach it but the mark that forewarn me of it in like manner the noise that i hear be not the effect of this or that motion or collision of the ambient body but the sign thereof secondly the reason why ideas be form into machine that be artificial and regular combinations be the same with that for combine letter into word that a few original ideas may be make to signify a great number of effect and action it be necessary they be variously combine together and to the end their use be permanent and universal these combinations must be make by rule and with wise contrivance by this mean abundance of information be convey unto us concern what we be to expect from such and such action and what methods be proper to be take for the excite such and such ideas which in effect be all that i conceive to be distinctly mean when it be say that by discern the figure texture and mechanism of the inward part of body whether natural or artificial we may attain to know the several use and properties depend thereon or the nature of the thing hence it be evident that those things which under the notion of a cause cooperate or concur to the production of effect be altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities may be very naturally explain and have a proper and obvious use assign them when they be consider only as mark or sign for our information and it be the search after and endeavour to understand those sign institute by the author of nature that ought to be the employment of the natural philosopher and not the pretend to explain things by corporeal cause which doctrine seem to have too much estrange the mind of men from that active principle that supreme and wise spirit in whom we live move and have our be in the twelfth place it may perhaps be object that though it be clear from what have be say that there can be no such thing as an inert senseless extend solid figure moveable substance exist without the mind such as philosophers describe matter yet if any man shall leave out of his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension figure solidity and motion and say that he mean only by that word an inert senseless substance that exist without the mind or unperceived which be the occasion of our ideas or at the presence whereof god be please to excite ideas in us it doth not appear but that matter take in this sense may possibly exist in answer to which i say first that it seem no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents than it be to suppose accidents without a substance but secondly though we should grant this unknown substance may possibly exist yet where can it be suppose to be that it exist not in the mind be agree and that it exist not in place be no less certain since all extension exist only in the mind as hath be already prove it remain therefore that it exist no where at all let us examine a little the description that be here give us of matter it neither act nor perceive nor be perceive for this be all that be mean by say it be an inert senseless unknown substance which be a definition intirely make up of negative except only the relative notion of its stand under or support but then it must be observe that it support nothing at all and how nearly this come to the description of a nonentity i desire may be consider but say you it be the unknown occasion at the presence of which ideas be excite in us by the will of god now i would fain know how any thing can be present to us which be neither perceivable by sense nor reflexion nor capable of produce any idea in our mind nor be at all extend nor hath any form nor exist in any place the word to be present when thus apply must need be take in some abstract and strange mean and which i be not able to comprehend again let us examine what be mean by occasion so far as i can gather from the common use of language that word signify either the agent which produce any effect or else something that be observe to accompany or go before it in the ordinary course of things but when it be apply to matter as above describe it can be take in neither of those sense for matter be say to be passive and inert and so can not be an agent or efficient cause it be also unperceivable as be devoid of all sensible qualities and so can not be the occasion of our perceptions in the latter sense as when the burn my finger be say to be the occasion of the pain that attend it what therefore can be mean by call matter an occasion this term be either use in no sense at all or else in some sense very distant from its receive signification you will perhaps say that matter though it be not perceive by us be nevertheless perceive by god to whom it be the occasion of excite ideas in our mind for say you since we observe our sensations to be imprint in an orderly and constant manner it be but reasonable to suppose there be certain constant and regular occasion of their be produce that be to say that there be certain permanent and distinct parcel of matter correspond to our ideas which though they do not excite them in our mind or any ways immediately affect us as be altogether passive and unperceivable to us they be nevertheless to god by whom they be perceive as it be so many occasion to remind him when and what ideas to imprint on our mind that so things may go on in a constant uniform manner in answer to this i observe that as the notion of matter be here state the question be no longer concern the existence of a thing distinct from spirit and idea from perceive and be perceive but whether there be not certain ideas of i know not what sort in the mind of god which be so many mark or note that direct him how to produce sensations in our mind in a constant and regular method much after the same manner as a musician be direct by the note of musick to produce that harmonious train and composition of sound which be call a tune though they who hear the musick do not perceive the note and may be intirely ignorant of them but this notion of matter seem too extravagant to deserve a confutation besides it be in effect no objection against what we have advance to wit that there be no senseless unperceived substance if we follow the light of reason we shall from the constant uniform method of our sensations collect the goodness and wisdom of the spirit who excite them in our mind but this be all that i can see reasonably conclude from thence to me i say it be evident that the be of a spirit infinitely wise good and powerful be abundantly sufficient to explain all the appearances of nature but as for inert senseless matter nothing that i perceive have any the least connexion with it or lead to the thoughts of it and i would fain see any one explain any the meanest phænomenon in nature by it or shew any manner of reason though in the lowest rank of probability that he can have for its existence or even make any tolerable sense or mean of that supposition for as to its be an occasion we have i think evidently shew that with regard to us it be no occasion it remain therefore that it must be if at all the occasion to god of excite ideas in us and what this amount to we have just now see it be worth while to reflect a little on the motives which induce men to suppose the existence of material substance that so have observe the gradual cease and expiration of those motives or reason we may proportionably withdraw the assent that be ground on them first therefore it be think that colour figure motion and the rest of the sensible qualities or accidents do really exist without the mind and for this reason it seem needful to suppose some unthinking substratum or substance wherein they do exist since they could not be conceive to exist by themselves afterwards in process of time men be convince that colour sound and the rest of the sensible secondary qualities have no existence without the mind they strip this substratum or material substance of those qualities leave only the primary ones figure motion and such like which they still conceive to exist without the mind and consequently to stand in need of a material support but it have be shew that none even of these can possibly exist otherwise than in a spirit or mind which perceive them it follow that we have no longer any reason to suppose the be of matter nay that it be utterly impossible there should be any such thing so long as that word be take to denote an unthinking substratum of qualities or accidents wherein they exist without the mind but though it be allow by the materialists themselves that matter be think of only for the sake of support accidents and the reason intirely cease one might expect the mind should naturally and without any reluctance at all quit the belief of what be solely ground thereon yet the prejudice be rivet so deeply in our thoughts that we can scarce tell how to part with it and be therefore incline since the thing it self be indefensible at least to retain the name which we apply to i know not what abstract and indefinite notions of be or occasion though without any shew of reason at least so far as i can see for what be there on our part or what do we perceive amongst all the ideas sensations notions which be imprint on our mind either by sense or reflexion from whence may be infer the existence of an inert thoughtless unperceived occasion and on the other hand on the part of an allsufficient spirit what can there be that should make us believe or even suspect he be direct by an inert occasion to excite ideas in our mind it be a very extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice and much to be lament that the mind of man retain so great a fondness against all the evidence of reason for a stupid thoughtless somewhat by the interposition whereof it would as it be skreen it self from the providence of god and remove him farther off from the affairs of the world but though we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of matter though when reason forsake us we endeavour to support our opinion on the bare possibility of the thing and though we indulge our selves in the full scope of an imagination not regulate by reason to make out that poor possibility yet the upshot of all be that there be certain unknown ideas in the mind of god for this if any thing be all that i conceive to be mean by occasion with regard to god and this at the bottom be no longer contend for the thing but for the name whether therefore there be such ideas in the mind of god and whether they may be call by the name matter i shall not dispute but if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of extension motion and other sensible qualities then to me it be most evidently impossible there should be any such thing since it be a plain repugnancy that those qualities should exist in or be support by an unperceiving substance but say you though it be grant that there be no thoughtless support of extension and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive yet there may perhaps be some inert unperceiving substance or substratum of some other qualities as incomprehensible to us as colour be to a man bear blind because we have not a sense adapt to them but if we have a new sense we should possibly no more doubt of their existence than a blindman make to see do of the existence of light and colour i answer first if what you mean by the word matter be only the unknown support of unknown qualities it be no matter whether there be such a thing or no since it no way concern us and i do not see the advantage there be in dispute about what we know not what and we know not why but secondly if we have a new sense it could only furnish us with new ideas or sensations and then we should have the same reason against their exist in an unperceiving substance that have be already offer with relation to figure motion colour and the like qualities as hath be shew be nothing else but sensations or ideas which exist only in a mind perceive them and this be true not only of the ideas we be acquaint with at present but likewise of all possible ideas whatsoever but you will insist what if i have no reason to believe the existence of matter what if i can not assign any use to it or explain any thing by it or even conceive what be mean by that word yet still it be no contradiction to say that matter exist and that this matter be in general a substance or occasion of ideas though indeed to go about to unfold the mean or adhere to any particular explication of those word may be attend with great difficulties i answer when word be use without a mean you may put them together as you please without danger of run into a contradiction you may say for example that twice two be equal to seven so long as you declare you do not take the word of that proposition in their usual acceptation but for mark of you know not what and by the same reason you may say there be an inert thoughtless substance without accidents which be the occasion of our ideas and we shall understand just as much by one proposition as the other in the last place you will say what if we give up the cause of material substance and assert that matter be an unknown somewhat neither substance nor accident spirit nor idea inert thoughtless indivisible immoveable unextended exist in no place for say you whatever may be urge against substance or occasion or any other positive or relative notion of matter hath no place at all so long as this negative definition of matter be adhere to i answer you may if so it shall seem good use the word matter in the same sense that other men use nothing and so make those term convertible in your style for after all this be what appear to me to be the result of that definition the part whereof when i consider with attention either collectively or separate from each other i do not find that there be any kind of effect or impression make on my mind different from what be excite by the term nothing you will reply perhaps that in the foresaid definition be include what doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing the positive abstract idea of quiddity entity or existence i own indeed that those who pretend to the faculty of frame abstract general ideas do talk as if they have such an idea which be say they the most abstract and general notion of all that be to me the most incomprehensible of all others that there be a great variety of spirit of different order and capacities whose faculties both in number and extent be far exceed those the author of my be have bestow on me i see no reason to deny and for me to pretend to determine by my own few stint narrow inlets of perception what ideas the inexhaustible power of the supreme spirit may imprint upon them be certainly the utmost folly and presumption since there may be for ought that i know innumerable sort of ideas or sensations as different from one another and from all that i have perceive as colour be from sound but how ready soever i may be to acknowledge the scantiness of my comprehension with regard to the endless variety of spirit and ideas that might possibly exist yet for any one to pretend to a notion of entity or existence abstract from spirit and idea from perceive and be perceive be i suspect a downright repugnancy and trifle with word it remain that we consider the objections which may possibly be make on the part of religion some there be who think that though the arguments for the real existence of body which be draw from reason be allow not to amount to demonstration yet the holy scriptures be so clear in the point as will sufficiently convince every good christian that body do really exist and be something more than mere ideas there be in holy writ innumerable facts relate which evidently suppose the reality of timber and stone mountains and rivers and cities and humane body to which i answer that no sort of write whatever sacred or profane which use those and the like word in the vulgar acceptation or so as to have a mean in them be in danger of have their truth call in question by our doctrine that all those things do really exist that there be body even corporeal substances when take in the vulgar sense have be shew to be agreeable to our principles and the difference betwixt things and ideas realities and chimeras have be distinctly explain and i do not think that either what philosophers call matter or the existence of object without the mind be any where mention in scripture again whether there be or be not external things it be agree on all hand that the proper use of word be the mark our conceptions or things only as they be know and perceive by us whence it plainly follow that in the tenets we have lay down there be nothing inconsistent with the right use and significancy of language and that discourse of what kind soever so far as it be intelligible remain undisturbed but all this seem so manifest from what hath be set forth in the premise that it be needle to insist any farther on it but it will be urge that miracles do at least lose much of their stress and import by our principles what must we think of mosess rod be it not really turn into a serpent or be there only a change of ideas in the mind of the spectators and can it be suppose that our saviour do no more at the marriagefeast in cana than impose on the sight and smell and taste of the guests so as to create in them the appearance or idea only of wine the same may be say of all other miracles which in consequence of the forego principles must be look upon only as so many cheat or illusions of fancy to this i reply that the rod be change into a real serpent and the water into real wine that this doth not in the least contradict what i have elsewhere say will be evident from sect and but this business of real and imaginary hath be already so plainly and fully explain and so often refer to and the difficulties about it be so easily answer from what hath go before that it be an affront to the readers understand to resume the explication of it in this place i shall only observe that if at table all who be present should see and smell and taste and drink wine and find the effect of it with me there could be no doubt of its reality so that at bottom the scruple concern real miracles hath no place at all on ours but only on the receive principles and consequently maketh rather for than against what hath be say have do with the objections which i endeavour to propose in the clearest light and give them all the force and weight i could we proceed in the next place to take a view of our tenets in their consequences some of these appear at first sight as that several difficult and obscure question on which abundance of speculation hath be throw away be intirely banish from philosophy whether corporeal substance can think whether sect xxix xxx xxxiii xxxvi c matter be infinitely divisible and how it operate on spirit these and like inquiries have give infinite amusement to philosophers in all age but depend on the existence of matter they have no longer any place on our principles many other advantage there be as well with regard to religion as the sciences which it be easy for any one to deduce from what hath be premise but this will appear more plainly in the sequel from the principles we have lay down it follow humane knowledge may naturally be reduce to two head that of ideas and that of spirit of each of these i shall treat in order and first as to ideas or unthinking things our knowledge of these hath be very much obscure and confound and we have be lead into very dangerous errors by suppose a twofold existence of the object of sense the one intelligible or in the mind the other real and without the mind whereby unthinking things be think to have a natural subsistence of their own distinct from be perceive by spirit this which if i mistake not hath be shew to be a most groundless and absurd notion be the very root of scepticism for so long as men think that real things subsist without the mind and that their knowledge be only so far forth real as it be conformable to real things it follow they could not be certain they have any real knowledge at all for how can it be know that the things which be perceive be conformable to those which be not perceive or exist without the mind colour figure motion extension and the like consider only as so many sensations in the mind be perfectly know there be nothing in them which be not perceive but if they be look on as note or image refer to things or archetypes exist without the mind then be we involve all in scepticism we see only the appearances and not the real qualities of things what may be the extension figure or motion of any thing really and absolutely or in it self it be impossible for us to know but only the proportion or the relation they bear to our sense things remain the same our ideas vary and which of them or even whether any of them at all represent the true quality really exist in the thing it be out of our reach to determine so that for ought we know all we see hear and feel may be only phantom and vain chimera and not at all agree with the real things exist in rerum natura all this scepticism follow from our suppose a difference between things and ideas and that the former have a subsistence without the mind or unperceived it be easy to dilate on this subject and shew how the arguments urge by sceptics in all age depend on the supposition of external object so long as we attribute a real existence to unthinking things distinct from their be perceive it be not only impossible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real unthinking be but even that it exist hence it be that we see philosophers distrust their sense and doubt of the existence of heaven and earth of every thing they see or feel even of their own body and after all their labour and struggle of think they be force to own we can not attain to any selfevident or demonstrative knowledge of the existence of sensible things but all this doubtfulness which so bewilder and confound the mind and make philosophy ridiculous in the eye of the world vanish if we annex a mean to our word and do not amuse our selves with the term absolute external exist and such like signify we know not what i can as well doubt of my own be as of the be of those things which i actually perceive by sense it be a manifest contradiction that any sensible object should be immediately perceive by sight or touch and at the same time have no existence in nature since the very existence of an unthinking be consist in be perceive nothing seem of more importance towards erect a firm systeme of sound and real knowledge which may be proof against the assault of scepticism than to lay the begin in a distinct explication of what be mean by thing reality existence for in vain shall we dispute concern the real existence of things or pretend to any knowledge thereof so long as we have not fix the mean of those word thing or be be the most general name of all it comprehend under it two kinds intirely distinct and heterogeneous and which have nothing common but the name to wit spirit and ideas the former be active indivisible substances the latter be inert fleet dependent be which subsist not by themselves but be support by or exist in mind or spiritual substances we comprehend our own existence by inward feel or reflexion and that of other spirit by reason we may be say to have some knowledge or notion of our own mind of spirit and active be whereof in a strict sense we have not ideas in like manner we know and have a notion of relations between things or ideas which relations be distinct from the ideas or things relate inasmuch as the latter may be perceive by us without our perceive the former to me it seem that ideas spirit and relations be all in their respective kinds the object of humane knowledge and subject of discourse and that the term idea would be improperly extend to signify every thing we know or have any notion of ideas imprint on the sense be real things or do really exist this we do not deny but we deny they can subsist without the mind which perceive them or that they be resemblances of any archetypes exist without the mind since the very be of a sensation or idea consist in be perceive and an idea can be like nothing but an idea again the things perceive by sense may be term external with regard to their origin in that they be not generate from within by the mind it self but imprint by a spirit distinct from that which perceive them sensible object may likewise be say to be without the mind in another sense namely when they exist in some other mind thus when i shut my eye the things i saw may still exist but it must be in another mind it be a mistake to think that what be here say derogate in the least from the reality of things it be acknowledge on the receive principles that extension motion and in a word all sensible qualities have need of a support as not be able to subsist by themselves but the object perceive by sense be allow to be nothing but combinations of those qualities and consequently can not subsist by themselves thus far it be agree on all hand so that in deny the things perceive by sense an existence independent of a substance or support wherein they may exist we detract nothing from the receive opinion of their reality and be guilty of no innovation in that respect all the difference be that accord to us the unthinking be perceive by sense have no existence distinct from be perceive and can not therefore exist in any other substance than those unextended indivisible substances or spirit which act and think and perceive them whereas philosophers vulgarly hold that the sensible qualities exist in an inert extend unperceiving substance which they call matter to which they attribute a natural subsistence exterior to all think be or distinct from be perceive by any mind whatsoever even the eternal mind of the creator wherein they suppose only ideas of the corporeal substances create by him if indeed they allow them to be at all create for as we have shew the doctrine of matter or corporeal substance to have be the main pillar and support of scepticism so likewise upon the same foundation have be raise all the impious scheme of atheism and irreligion nay so great a difficulty hath it be think to conceive matter produce out of nothing that the most celebrate among the ancient philosophers even of these who maintain the be of a god have think matter to be uncreated and coeternal with him how great a friend material substance hath be to atheists in all age be needle to relate all their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence on it that when this cornerstone be once remove the whole fabrick can not choose but fall to the grind insomuch that it be no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of atheists that impious and profane persons should readily fall in with those systems which favour their inclinations by deride immaterial substance and suppose the soul to be divisible and subject to corruption as the body which exclude all freedom intelligence and design from the formation of things and instead thereof make a selfexistent stupid unthinking substance the root and origin of all be that they should hearken to those who deny a providence or inspection of a superior mind over the affairs of the world attribute the whole series of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity arise from the impulse of one body on another all this be very natural and on the other hand when men of better principles observe the enemies of religion lay so great a stress on unthinking matter and all of them use so much industry and artifice to reduce every thing to it methinks they should rejoice to see them deprive of their grand support and drive from that only fortress without which your epicureans hobbists and the like have not even the shadow of a pretence but become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world the existence of matter or body unperceived have not only be the main support of atheists and fatalists but on the same principle doth idolatry likewise in all its various form depend do men but consider that the sun moon and star and every other object of the sense be only so many sensations in their mind which have no other existence but barely be perceive doubtless they would never fall down and worship their own ideas but rather address their homage to that eternal invisible mind which produce and sustain all things the same absurd principle by mingle it self with the article of our faith hath occasion no small difficulties to christians for example about the resurrection how many scruple and objections have be raise by socinians and others but do not the most plausible of them depend on the supposition that a body be denominate the same with regard not to the form or that which be perceive by sense but the material substance which remain the same under several form take away this material substance about the identity whereof all the dispute be and mean by body what every plain ordinary person mean by that word to wit that which be immediately see and felt which be only a combination of sensible qualities or ideas and then their most unanswerable objections come to nothing matter be once expel out of nature drag with it so many sceptical and impious notions such an incredible number of dispute and puzling question which have be thorns in the side of divine as well as philosophers and make so much fruitless work for mankind that if the arguments we have produce against it be not find equal to demonstration as to me they evidently seem yet i be sure all friends to knowledge peace and religion have reason to wish they be beside the external existence of the object of perception another great source of errors and difficulties with regard to ideal knowledge be the doctrine of abstract ideas such as it hath be set forth in the introduction the plainest things in the world those we be most intimately acquaint with and perfectly know when they be consider in an abstract way appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible time place and motion take in particular or concrete be what every body know but have pass through the hand of a metaphysician they become too abstract and fine to be apprehend by men of ordinary sense bid your servant meet you at such a time in such a place and he shall never stay to deliberate on the mean of those word in conceive that particular time and place or the motion by which he be to get thither he find not the least difficulty but if time be take exclusive of all those particular action and ideas that diversify the day merely for the continuation of existence or duration in abstract then it will perhaps gravel even a philosopher to comprehend it whenever i attempt to frame a simple idea of time abstract from the succession of ideas in my mind which flow uniformly and be participate by all be i be lose and embrangle in inextricable difficulties i have no notion of it at all only i hear others say it be infinitely divisible and speak of it in such a manner as lead me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence since that doctrine lay one under an absolute necessity of think either that he pass away innumerable age without a think or else that he be annihilate every moment of his life both which seem equally absurd time therefore be nothing abstract from the sucession of ideas in our mind it follow that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimate by the number of ideas or action succeed each other in that same spirit or mind hence it be a plain consequence that the soul always think and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation will i believe find it no easy task so likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities and consider them by themselves we presently lose sight of them and run into great extravagancies all which depend on a twofold abstraction first it be suppose that extension for example may be abstract from all other sensible qualities and secondly that the entity of extension may be abstract from its be perceive but whoever shall reflect and take care to understand what he say will if i mistake not acknowledge that all sensible qualities be alike sensations and alike real that where the extension be there be the colour too to wit in his mind and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind and that the object of sense be nothing but those sensations combine blend or if one may so speak concrete together none of all which can be suppose to exist unperceived what it be for a man to be happy or an object good every one may think he know but to frame an abstract idea of happiness prescinded from all particular pleasure or of goodness from every thing that be good this be what few can pretend to so likewise a man may be just and virtuous without have precise ideas of justice and virtue the opinion that those and the like word stand for general notions abstract from all particular persons and action seem to have render morality difficult and the study thereof of less use to mankind and in effect the doctrine of abstraction have not a little contribute towards spoil the most useful part of knowledge the two great provinces of speculative science conversant about ideas receive from sense and their relations be natural philosophy and mathematics with regard to each of these i shall make some observations and first i shall say somewhat of natural philosophy on this subject it be that the sceptics triumph all that stock of arguments they produce to depreciate our faculties and make mankind appear ignorant and low be draw principally from this head to wit that we be under an invincible blindness as to the true and real nature of things this they exaggerate and love to enlarge on we be miserably banter say they by our sense and amuse only with the outside and shew of things the real essence the internal qualities and constitution of every the meanest object be hide from our view something there be in every drop of water every grain of sand which it be beyond the power of humane understand to fathom or comprehend but it be evident from what have be shew that all this complaint be groundless and that we be influence by false principles to that degree as to mistrust our sense and think we know nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend one great inducement to our pronounce our selves ignorant of the nature of things be the current opinion that every thing include within it self the cause of its properties or that there be in each object an inward essence which be the source whence its discernible qualities flow and whereon they depend some have pretend to account for appearances by occult qualities but of late they be mostly resolve into mechanical cause to wit the figure motion weight and such like qualities of insensible particles whereas in truth there be no other agent or efficient cause than spirit it be evident that motion as well as all other ideas be perfectly inert see sect hence to endeavour to explain the production of colour or sound by figure motion magnitude and the like must need be labour in vain and accordingly we see the attempt of that kind be not at all satisfactory which may be say in general of those instance wherein one idea or quality be assign for the cause of another i need not say how many hypotheses and speculations be leave out and how much the study of nature be abridge by this doctrine the great mechanical principle now in vogue be attraction that a stone fall to the earth or the sea swell towards the moon may to some appear sufficiently explain thereby but how be we enlighten by be tell this be do by attraction be it that that word signify the manner of the tendency and that it be by the mutual draw of body instead of their be impel or protrude towards each other but nothing be determine of the manner or action and it may as truly for ought we know be term impulse or protrusion as attraction again the part of steel we see cohere firmly together and this also be account for by attraction but in this as in the other instance i do not perceive that any thing be signify besides the effect it self for as to the manner of the action whereby it be produce or the cause which produce it these be not so much as aim at indeed if we take a view of the several phænomena and compare them together we may observe some liken and conformity between them for example in the fall of a stone to the grind in the rise of the sea towards the moon in cohesion and crystallization there be something alike namely an union or mutual approach of body so that any one of these or the like phænomena may not seem strange or surprise to a man who hath nicely observe and compare the effect of nature for that only be think so which be uncommon or a thing by it self and out of the ordinary course of our observation that body should tend towards the center of the earth be not think strange because it be what we perceive every moment of our live but that they should have a like gravitation towards the center of the moon may seem odd and unaccountable to most men because it be discern only in the tide but a philosopher whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature have observe a certain similitude of appearances as well in the heavens as the earth that argue innumerable body to have a mutual tendency towards each other which he denote by the general name attraction whatever can be reduce to that he think justly account for thus he explain the tide by the attraction of the terraqueous globe towards the moon which to him doth not appear odd or anomalous but only a particular example of a general rule or law of nature if therefore we consider the difference there be betwixt natural philosophers and other men with regard to their knowledge of the phænomena we shall find it consist not in an exacter knowledge of the efficient cause that produce them for that can be no other than the will of a spirit but only in a greater largeness of comprehension whereby analogies harmonies and agreements be discover in the work of nature and the particular effect explain that be reduce to general rule see sect which rule ground on the analogy and uniformness observe in the production of natural effect be most agreeable and seek after by the mind for that they extend our prospect beyond what be present and near to us and enable us to make very probable conjecture touch things that may have happen at very great distance of time and place as well as to predict things to come which sort of endeavour towards omniscience be much affect by the mind but we should proceed warily in such things for we be apt to lay too great a stress on analogies and to the prejudice of truth humour that eagerness of the mind whereby it be carry to extend its knowledge into general theoremes for example gravitation or mutual attraction because it appear in many instance some be straightway for pronounce universal and that to attract and be attract by every other body be an essential quality inherent in all body whatsoever whereas it appear the fix star have no such tendency towards each other and so far be that gravitation from be essential to body that in some instance a quite contrary principle seem to shew it self as in the perpendicular growth of plant and the elasticity of the air there be nothing necessary or essential in the case but it depend intirely on the will of the govern spirit who cause certain body to cleave together or tend towards each other accord to various laws whilst he keep others at a fix distance and to some he give a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder just as he see convenient after what have be premise i think we may lay down the follow conclusions first it be plain philosophers amuse themselves in vain when they inquire for any natural efficient cause distinct from a mind or spirit secondly consider the whole creation be the workmanship of a wise and good agent it should seem to become philosophers to employ their thoughts contrary to what some hold about the final cause of things and i must confess i see no reason why point out the various end to which natural things be adapt and for which they be originally with unspeakable wisdom contrive should not be think one good way of account for them and altogether worthy a philosopher thirdly from what hath be premise no reason can be draw why the history of nature should not still be study and observations and experiment make which that they be of use to mankind and enable us to draw any general conclusions be not the result of any immutable habitudes or relations between things themselves but only of gods goodness and kindness to men in the administration of the world see sect and fourthly by a diligent observation of the phænomena within our view we may discover the general laws of nature and from them deduce the other phænomena i do not say demonstrate for all deductions of that kind depend on a supposition that the author of nature always operate uniformly and in a constant observance of those rule we take for principles which we can not evidently know those men who frame general rule from the phænomena and afterwards derive the phænomena from those rule seem to consider sign rather than cause a man may well understand natural sign without know their analogy or be able to say by what rule a thing be so or so and as it be very possible to write improperly through too strict an observance of general grammarrules so in argue from general rule of nature it be not impossible we may extend the analogy too far and by that mean run into mistake as in read other book a wise man will choose to fix his thoughts on the sense and apply it to use rather than lay them out in grammatical remark on the language so in peruse the volume of nature it seem beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reduce each particular phænomenon to general rule or shew how it follow from them we should propose to ourselves nobler view such as to recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty order extent and variety of natural things hence by proper inferences to enlarge our notions of the grandeur wisdom and beneficence of the creator and lastly to make the several part of the creation so far as in us lie subservient to the end they be design for gods glory and the sustentation and comfort of our selves and fellowcreatures the best key for the aforesaid analogy or natural science will be easily acknowledge to be a certain celebrate treatise of mechanics in the entrance of which justly admire treatise time space and motion be distinguish into absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and vulgar which distinction as it be at large explain by the author doth suppose those quantities to have an existence without the mind and that they be ordinarily conceive with relation to sensible things to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no relation at all as for time as it be there take in an absolute or abstract sense for the duration or perseverance of the existence of things i have nothing more to add concern it after what hath be already say on that subject sect and for the rest this celebrate author hold there be an absolute space which be unperceivable to sense remain in it self similar and immoveable and relative space to be the measure thereof which be moveable and define by its situation in respect of sensible body be vulgarly take for immoveable space place he define to be that part of space which be occupy by any body and accord as the space be absolute or relative so also be the place absolute motion be say to be the translation of a body from absolute place to absolute place as relative motion be from one relative place to another and because the part of absolute space do not fall under our sense instead of them we be oblige to use their sensible measure and so define both place and motion with respect to body which we regard as immoveable but it be say in philosophical matter we must abstract from our sense since it may be that none of those body which seem to be quiescent be truly so and the same thing which be move relatively may be really at rest as likewise one and the same body may be in relative rest and motion or even move with contrary relative motion at the same time accord as its place be variously define all which ambiguity be to be find in the apparent motion but not at all in the true or absolute which should therefore be alone regard in philosophy and the true we be tell be distinguish from apparent or relative motion by the follow properties first in true or absolute motion all part which preserve the same position with respect to the whole partake of the motion of the whole secondly the place be move that which be place therein be also move so that a body move in a place which be in motion doth participate the motion of its place thirdly true motion be never generate or change otherwise than by force impress on the body it self fourthly true motion be always change by force impress on the body move fifthly in circular motion barely relative there be no centrifugal force which nevertheless in that which be true or absolute be proportional to the quantity of motion but notwithstanding what hath be say it doth not appear to me that there can be any motion other than relative so that to conceive motion there must be at least conceive two body whereof the distance or position in regard to each other be vary hence if there be one only body in be it could not possibly be move this seem evident in that the idea i have of motion doth necessarily include relation but though in every motion it be necessary to conceive more body than one yet it may be that one only be move namely that on which the force cause the change of distance be impress or in other word that to which the action be apply for however some may define relative motion so as to term that body move which change its distance from some other body whether the force or action cause that change be apply to it or no yet as relative motion be that which be perceive by sense and regard in the ordinary affairs of life it should seem that every man of common sense know what it be as well as the best philosopher now i ask any one whether in his sense of motion as he walk along the streets the stone he pass over may be say to move because they change distance with his feet to me it seem that though motion include a relation of one thing to another yet it be not necessary that each term of the relation be denominate from it as a man may think of somewhat which doth not think so a body may be move to or from another body which be not therefore it self in motion as the place happen to be variously define the motion which be relate to it vary a man in a ship may be say to be quiescent with relation to the side of the vessel and yet move with relation to the land or he may move eastward in respect of the one and westward in respect of the other in the common affairs of life men never go beyond the earth to define the place of any body and what be quiescent in respect of that be account absolutely to be so but philosophers who have a greater extent of think and juster notions of the system of things discover even the earth it self to be move in order therefore to fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite and the utmost unmoved wall or shell thereof to be the place whereby they estimate true motion if we sound our own conceptions i believe we may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom no other than relative motion thus define for as hath be already observe absolute motion exclusive of all external relation be incomprehensible and to this kind of relative motion all the abovementioned properties cause and effect ascribe to absolute motion will if i mistake not be find to agree as to what be say of the centrifugal force that it doth not at all belong to circular relative motion i do not see how this follow from the experiment which be bring to prove it see philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica in schol def for the water in the vessel at that time wherein it be say to have the greatest relative circular motion hath i think no motion at all as be plain from the forego section for to denominate a body move it be requisite first that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other body and secondly that the force or action occasion that change be apply to it if either of these be want i do not think that agreeably to the sense of mankind or the propriety of language a body can be say to be in motion i grant indeed that it be possible for us to think a body which we see change its distance from some other to be move though it have no force apply to it in which sense there may be apparent motion but then it be because the force cause the change of distance be imagine by us to be apply or impress on that body think to move which indeed shew we be capable of mistake a thing to be in motion which be not and that be all from what hath be say it follow that the philosophic consideration of motion doth not imply the be of an absolute space distinct from that which be perceive by sense and relate to body which that it can not exist without the mind be clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like of all other object of sense and perhaps if we inquire narrowly we shall find we can not even frame an idea of pure space exclusive of all body this i must confess seem impossible as be a most abstract idea when i excite a motion in some part of my body if it be free or without resistance i say there be space but if i find a resistance then i say there be body and in proportion as the resistance to motion be lesser or greater i say the space be more or less pure so that when i speak of pure or empty space it be not to be suppose that the word space stand for an idea distinct from or conceivable without body and motion though indeed we be apt to think every noun substantive stand for a distinct idea that may be separate from all others which hath occasion infinite mistake when therefore suppose all the world to be annihilate besides my own body i say there still remain pure space thereby nothing else be mean but only that i conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be move on all side without the least resistance but if that too be annihilate then there could be no motion and consequently no space some perhaps may think the sense of see doth furnish them with the idea of pure space but it be plain from what we have elsewhere shew that the ideas of space and distance be not obtain by that sense see the essay concern vision what be here lay down seem to put an end to all those dispute and difficulties which have spring up amongst the learn concern the nature of pure space but the chief advantage arise from it be that we be free from that dangerous dilemma to which several who have employ their thoughts on this subject imagine themselves reduce to wit of think either that real space be god or else that there be something beside god which be eternal uncreated infinite indivisible immutable both which may justly be think pernicious and absurd notions it be certain that not a few divine as well as philosophers of great note have from the difficulty they find in conceive either limit or annihilation of space conclude it must be divine and some of late have set themselves particularly to shew that the incommunicable attribute of god agree to it which doctrine how unworthy soever it may seem of the divine nature yet i do not see how we can get clear of it so long as we adhere to the receive opinions hitherto of natural philosophy we come now to make some inquiry concern that other great branch of speculative knowledge to wit mathematics these how celebrate soever they may be for their clearness and certainty of demonstration which be hardly any where else to be find can not nevertheless be suppose altogether free from mistake if in their principles there lurk some secret error which be common to the professors of those sciences with the rest of mankind mathematicians though they deduce their theoremes from a great height of evidence yet their first principles be limit by the consideration of quantity and they do not ascend into any inquiry concern those transcendental maxims which influence all the particular sciences each part whereof mathematics not except doth consequently participate of the errors involve in them that the principles lay down by mathematicians be true and their way of deduction from those principles clear and incontestible we do not deny but we hold there may be certain erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of mathematics and for that reason not expresly mention though tacitly suppose throughout the whole progress of that science and that the ill effect of those secret unexamined errors be diffuse through all the branch thereof to be plain we suspect the mathematicians be as well as other men concern in the errors arise from the doctrine of abstract general ideas and the existence of object without the mind arithmetic hath be think to have for its object abstract ideas of number of which to understand the properties and mutual habitudes be suppose no mean part of speculative knowledge the opinion of the pure and intellectual nature of number in abstract hath make them in esteem with those philosophers who seem to have affect an uncommon fineness and elevation of think it hath set a price on the most trifle numerical speculations which in practice be of no use but serve only for amusement and hath therefore so far infect the mind of some that they have dream of mighty mysteries involve in number and attempt the explication of natural things by them but if we inquire into our own thoughts and consider what hath be premise we may perhaps entertain a low opinion of those high flight and abstractions and look on all inquiries about number only as so many difficiles nugæ so far as they be not subservient to practice and promote the benefit of life unity in abstract we have before consider in sect from which and what hath be say in the introduction it plainly follow there be not any such idea but number be define a collection of unite we may conclude that if there be no such thing as unity or unite in abstract there be no ideas of number in abstract denote by the numeral name and figure the theories therefore in arithmetic if they be abstract from the name and figure as likewise from all use and practice as well as from the particular things number can be suppose to have nothing at all for their object hence we may see how intirely the science of number be subordinate to practice and how jejune and trifle it become when consider as a matter of mere speculation however since there may be some who delude by the specious shew of discover abstract verities waste their time in arithmetical theoremes and problemes which have not any use it will not be amiss if we more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretence and this will plainly appear by take a view of arithmetic in its infancy and observe what it be that originally put men on the study of that science and to what scope they direct it it be natural to think that at first men for ease of memory and help of computation make use of counter or in write of single stroke point or the like each whereof be make to signify an unite that be some one thing of whatever kind they have occasion to reckon afterwards they find out the more compendious ways of make one character stand in place of several stroke or point and lastly the notation of the arabians or indians come into use wherein by the repetition of a few character or figure and vary the signification of each figure accord to the place it obtain all number may be most aptly express which seem to have be do in imitation of language so that an exact analogy be observe betwixt the notation by figure and name the nine simple figure answer the nine first numeral name and place in the former correspond to denominations in the latter and agreeably to those condition of the simple and local value of figure be contrive methods of find from the give figure or mark of the part what figure and how place be proper to denote the whole or vice versa and have find the seek figure the same rule or analogy be observe throughout it be easy to read them into word and so the number become perfectly know for then the number of any particular things be say to be know when we know the name or figure with their due arrangement that accord to the stand analogy belong to them for these sign be know we can by the operations of arithmetic know the sign of any part of the particular sum signify by them and thus compute in sign because of the connexion establish betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of things whereof one be take for an unite we may be able rightly to sum up divide and proportion the things themselves that we intend to number in arithmetic therefore we regard not the things but the sign which nevertheless be not regard for their own sake but because they direct us how to act with relation to things and dispose rightly of them now agreeably to what we have before observe of word in general sect introd it happen here likewise that abstract ideas be think to be signify by numeral name or character while they do not suggest ideas of particular things to our mind i shall not at present enter into a more particular dissertation on this subject but only observe that it be evident from what hath be say those things which pass for abstract truths and theoremes concern number be in reality conversant about no object distinct from particular numerable things except only name and character which originally come to be consider on no other account but their be sign or capable to represent aptly whatever particular things men have need to compute whence it follow that to study them for their own sake would be just as wise and to as good purpose as if a man neglect the true use or original intention and subserviency of language should spend his time in impertinent criticisms upon word or reason and controversies purely verbal from number we proceed to speak of extension which consider as relative be the object of geometry the infinite divisibility of finite extension though it be not expresly lay down either as an axiome or theoreme in the elements of that science yet be throughout the same every where suppose and think to have so inseparable and essential a connexion with the principles and demonstrations in geometry that mathematicians never admit it into doubt or make the least question of it and as this notion be the source from whence do spring all those amuse geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the plain common sense of mankind and be admit with so much reluctance into a mind not yet debauch by learn so it be the principal occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty which render the study of mathematics so difficult and tedious hence if we can make it appear that no finite extension contain innumerable part or be infinitely divisible it follow that we shall at once clear the science of geometry from a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever be esteem a reproach to humane reason and withal make the attainment thereof a business of much less time and pain than it hitherto hath be every particular finite extension which may possibly be the object of our think be an idea exist only in the mind and consequently each part thereof must be perceive if therefore i can not perceive innumerable part in any finite extension that i consider it be certain they be not contain in it but it be evident that i can not distinguish innumerable part in any particular line surface or solid which i either perceive by sense or figure to my self in my mind wherefore i conclude they be not contain in it nothing can be plainer to me than that the extensions i have in view be no other than my own ideas and it be no less plain that i can not resolve any one of my ideas into an infinite number of other ideas that be that they be not infinitely divisible if by finite extension be mean something distinct from a finite idea i declare i do not know what that be and so can not affirm or deny any thing of it but if the term extension part and the like be take in any sense conceivable that be for ideas then to say a finite quantity or extension consist of part infinite in number be so manifest a contradiction that every one at first sight acknowledge it to be so and it be impossible it should ever gain the assent of any reasonable creature who be not bring to it by gentle and slow degrees as a convert gentile to the belief of transubstantiation ancient and root prejudice do often pass into principles and those proposition which once obtain the force and credit of a principle be not only themselves but likewise whatever be deducible from them think privilege from all examination and there be no absurdity so gross which by this mean the mind of man may not be prepare to swallow he whose understand be prepossest with the doctrine of abstract general ideas may be persuade that whatever be think of the ideas of sense extension in abstract be infinitely divisible and one who think the object of sense exist without the mind will perhaps in virtue thereof be bring to admit that a line but an inch long may contain innumerable part really exist though too small to be discern these errors be graft as well in the mind of geometricians as of other men and have a like influence on their reason and it be no difficult thing to shew how the arguments from geometry make use of to support the infinite divisibility of extension be bottom on them at present we shall only observe in general whence it be that the mathematicians be all so fond and tenacious of this doctrine it hath be observe in another place that the theoremes and demonstrations in geometry be conversant about universal ideas sect introd where it be explain in what sense this ought to be understand to wit that the particular line and figure include in the diagram be suppose to stand for innumerable others of different size or in other word the geometer consider them abstract from their magnitude which doth not imply that he form an abstract idea but only that he care not what the particular magnitude be whether great or small but look on that as a thing indifferent to the demonstration hence it follow that a line in the scheme but an inch long must be speak of as though it contain ten thousand part since it be regard not in it self but as it be universal and it be universal only in its signification whereby it represent innumerable line greater than it self in which may be distinguish ten thousand part or more though there may not be above an inch in it after this manner the properties of the line signify be by a very usual figure transfer to the sign and thence through mistake think to appertain to it consider in its own nature because there be no number of part so great but it be possible there may be a line contain more the inchline be say to contain part more than any assignable number which be true not of the inch take absolutely but only for the things signify by it but men not retain that distinction in their thoughts slide into a belief that the small particular line describe on paper contain in it self part innumerable there be no such thing as the tenthousandth part of an inch but there be of a mile or diameter of the earth which may be signify by that inch when therefore i delineate a triangle on paper and take one side not above an inch for example in length to be the radius this i consider as divide into ten thousand or an hundred thousand part or more for though the tenthousandth part of that line consider in it self be nothing at all and consequently may be neglect without any error or inconveniency yet these describe line be only mark stand for greater quantities whereof it may be the tenthousandth part be very considerable it follow that to prevent notable errors in practice the radius must be take of ten thousand part or more from what hath be say the reason be plain why to the end any theoreme may become universal in its use it be necessary we speak of the line describe on paper as though they contain part which really they do not in do of which if we examine the matter throughly we shall perhaps discover that we can not conceive an inch it self as consist of or be divisible into a thousand part but only some other line which be far greater than an inch and represent by it and that when we say a line be infinitely divisible we must mean a line which be infinitely great what we have here observe seem to be the chief cause why to suppose the infinite divisibility of finite extension hath be think necessary in geometry the several absurdities and contradictions which flow from this false principle might one would think have be esteem so many demonstrations against it but by i know not what logic it be hold that proof a posteriori be not to be admit against proposition relate to infinity as though it be not impossible even for an infinite mind to reconcile contradictions or as if any thing absurd and repugnant could have a necessary connexion with truth or flow from it but whoever consider the weakness of this pretence will think it be contrive on purpose to humour the laziness of the mind which have rather acquiesce in an indolent scepticism than be at the pain to go through with a severe examination of those principles it hath ever embrace for true of late the speculations about infinities have run so high and grow to such strange notions as have occasion no small scruple and dispute among the geometers of the present age some there be of great note who not content with hold that finite line may be divide into an infinite number of part do yet farther maintain that each of those infinitesimals be it self subdivisible into an infinity of other part or infinitesimals of a second order and so on ad infinitum these i say assert there be infinitesimals of infinitesimals of infinitesimals without ever come to an end so that accord to them an inch doth not barely contain an infinite number of part but an infinity of an infinity of an infinity ad infinitum of part others there be who hold all order of infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all think it with good reason absurd to imagine there be any positive quantity or part of extension which though multiply infinitely can ever equal the smallest give extension and yet on the other hand it seem no less absurd to think the square cube or other power of a positive real root should it self be nothing at all which they who hold infinitesimals of the first order deny all of the subsequent order be oblige to maintain have we not therefore reason to conclude they be both in the wrong and that there be in effect no such thing as part infinitely small or an infinite number of part contain in any finite quantity but you will say that if this doctrine obtain it will follow the very foundations of geometry be destroy and those great men who have raise that science to so astonish an height have be all the while build a castle in the air to this it may be reply that whatever be useful in geometry and promote the benefit of humane life doth still remain firm and unshaken on our principles that science consider as practical will rather receive advantage than any prejudice from what hath be say but to set this in a due light may be the subject of a distinct inquiry for the rest though it should follow that some of the more intricate and subtile part of speculative mathematics may be par off without any prejudice to truth yet i do not see what damage will be thence derive to mankind on the contrary it be highly to be wish that men of great abilities and obstinate application would draw off their thoughts from those amusements and employ them in the study of such things as lie nearer the concern of life or have a more direct influence on the manners if it be say that several theoremes undoubtedly true be discover by methods in which infinitesimals be make use of which could never have be if their existence include a contradiction in it i answer that upon a thorough examination it will not be find that in any instance it be necessary to make use of or conceive infinitesimal part of finite line or even quantities less than the minimum sensible nay it will be evident this be never do it be impossible by what we have premise it be plain that very numerous and important errors have take their rise from those false principles which be impugn in the forego part of this treatise and the opposites of those erroneous tenets at the same time appear to be most fruitful principles from whence do flow innumerable consequences highly advantageous to true philosophy as well as to religion particularly matter or the absolute existence of corporeal object hath be shew to be that wherein the most avow and pernicious enemies of all knowledge whether humane or divine have ever place their chief strength and confidence and surely if by distinguish the real existence of unthinking things from their be perceive and allow them a subsistence of their own out of the mind of spirit no one thing be explain in nature but on the contrary a great many inexplicable difficulties arise if the supposition of matter be barely precarious as not be ground on so much as one single reason if its consequences can not endure the light of examination and free inquiry but skreen themselves under the dark and general pretence of infinites be incomprehensible if withal the removal of this matter be not attend with the least evil consequence if it be not even miss in the world but every thing as well nay much easier conceive without it if lastly both sceptics and atheists be for ever silence upon suppose only spirit and ideas and this scheme of things be perfectly agreeable both to reason and religion methinks we may expect it should be admit and firmly embrace though it be propose only as an hypothesis and the existence of matter have be allow possible which yet i think we have evidently demonstrate that it be not true it be that in consequence of the forego principles several dispute and speculations which be esteem no mean part of learn be reject as useless but how great a prejudice soever against our notions this may give to those who have already be deeply engage and make large advance in study of that nature yet by others we hope it will not be think any just grind of dislike to the principles and tenets herein lay down that they abridge the labour of study and make humane sciences more clear compendious and attainable than they be before have despatch what we intend to say concern the knowledge of ideas the method we propose lead us in the next place to treat of spirit with regard to which perhaps humane knowledge be not so deficient as be vulgarly imagine the great reason that be assign for our be think ignorant of the nature of spirit be our not have an idea of it but surely it ought not to be look on as a defect in a humane understand that it do not perceive the idea of spirit if it be manifestly impossible there should be any such idea and this if i mistake not have be demonstrate in sect to which i shall here add that a spirit have be shew to be the only substance or support wherein the unthinking be or ideas can exist but that this substance which support or perceive ideas should it self be an idea or like an idea be evidently absurd it will perhaps be say that we want a sense as some have imagine proper to know substances withal which if we have we might know our own soul as we do a triangle to this i answer that in case we have a new sense bestow upon us we could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense but i believe no body will say that what he mean by the term soul and substance be only some particular sort of idea or sensation we may therefore infer that all things duly consider it be not more reasonable to think our faculties defective in that they do not furnish us with an idea of spirit or active think substance than it would be if we should blame them for not be able to comprehend a round square from the opinion that spirit be to be know after the manner of an idea or sensation have rise many absurd and heterodox tenets and much scepticism about the nature of the soul it be even probable that this opinion may have produce a doubt in some whether they have any soul at all distinct from their body since upon inquiry they could not find they have an idea of it that an idea which be inactive and the existence whereof consist in be perceive should be the image or liken of an agent subsist by it self seem to need no other refutation than barely attend to what be mean by those word but perhaps you will say that tho an idea can not resemble a spirit in its think act or subsist by it self yet it may in some other respect and it be not necessary that an idea or image be in all respect like the original i answer if it do not in those mention it be impossible it should represent it in any other thing do but leave out the power of will think and perceive ideas and there remain nothing else wherein the idea can be like a spirit for by the word spirit we mean only that which think will and perceive this and this alone constitute the signification of that term if therefore it be impossible that any degree of those power should be represent in an idea it be evident there can be no idea of a spirit but it will be object that if there be no idea signify by the term soul spirit and substance they be wholly insignificant or have no mean in them i answer those word do mean or signify a real thing which be neither an idea nor like an idea but that which perceive ideas and will and reason about them what i be my self that which i denote by the term i be the same with what be mean by soul or spiritual substance if it be say that this be only quarrel at a word and that since the immediate significations of other name be by common consent call ideas no reason can be assign why that which be signify by the name spirit or soul may not partake in the same appellation i answer all the unthinking object of the mind agree in that they be intirely passive and their existence consist only in be perceive whereas a soul or spirit be an active be whose existence consist not in be perceive but in perceive ideas and think it be therefore necessary in order to prevent equivocation and confound natures perfectly disagree and unlike that we distinguish between spirit and idea see sect in a large sense indeed we may be say to have an idea or rather a notion of spirit that be we understand the mean of the word otherwise we could not affirm or deny any thing of it moreover as we conceive the ideas that be in the mind of other spirit by mean of our own which we suppose to be resemblances of them so we know other spirit by mean of our own soul which in that sense be the image or idea of them it have a like respect to other spirit that blueness or heat by me perceive have to those ideas perceive by another it must not be suppose that they who assert the natural immortality of the soul be of opinion that it be absolutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinite power of the creator who first give it be but only that it be not liable to be break or dissolve by the ordinary laws of nature or motion they indeed who hold the soul of man to be only a thin vital flame or system of animal spirit make it perish and corruptible as the body since there be nothing more easily dissipate than such a be which it be naturally impossible should survive the ruin of the tabernacle wherein it be inclose and this notion hath be greedily embrace and cherish by the worst part of mankind as the most effectual antidote against all impressions of virtue and religion but it hath be make evident that body of what frame or texture soever be barely passive ideas in the mind which be more distant and heterogeneous from them than light be from darkness we have shew that the soul be indivisible incorporeal unextended and it be consequently incorruptible nothing can be plainer than that the motion change decay and dissolutions which we hourly see befal natural body and which be what we mean by the course of nature can not possibly affect an active simple uncompounded substance such a be therefore be indissoluble by the force of nature that be to say the soul of man be naturally immortal after what hath be say it be i suppose plain that our souls be not to be know in the same manner as senseless inactive object or by way of idea spirit and ideas be things so wholly different that when we say they exist they be know or the like these word must not be think to signify any thing common to both natures there be nothing alike or common in them and to expect that by any multiplication or enlargement of our faculties we may be enable to know a spirit as we do a triangle seem as absurd as if we should hope to see a sound this be inculcate because i imagine it may be of moment towards clear several important question and prevent some very dangerous errors concern the nature of the soul we may not i think strictly be say to have an idea of an active be or of an action although we may be say to have a notion of them i have some knowledge or notion of my mind and its act about ideas inasmuch as i know or understand what be mean by those word what i know that i have some notion of i will not say that the term idea and notion may not be use convertibly if the world will have it so but yet it conduceth to clearness and propriety that we distinguish things very different by different name it be also to be remark that all relations include an act of the mind we can not so properly be say to have an idea but rather a notion of the relations and habitudes between things but if in the modern way the word idea be extend to spirit and relations and act this be after all an affair of verbal concern it will not be amiss to add that the doctrine of abstract ideas hath have no small share in render those sciences intricate and obscure which be particularly conversant about spiritual things men have imagine they could frame abstract notions of the power and act of the mind and consider them prescinded as well from the mind or spirit it self as from their respective object and effect hence a great number of dark and ambiguous term presume to stand for abstract notions have be introduce into metaphysics and morality and from these have grow infinite distractions and dispute amongst the learn but nothing seem more to have contribute towards engage men in controversies and mistake with regard to the nature and operations of the mind than the be use to speak of those things in term borrow from sensible ideas for example the will be term the motion of the soul this infuse a belief that the mind of man be as a ball in motion impel and determine by the object of sense as necessarily as that be by the stroke of a racket hence arise endless scruple and errors of dangerous consequence in morality all which i doubt not may be clear and truth appear plain uniform and consistent could but philosophers be prevail on to retire into themselves and attentively consider their own mean from what hath be say it be plain that we can not know the existence of other spirit otherwise than by their operations or the ideas by them excite in us i perceive several motion change and combinations of ideas that inform me there be certain particular agents like my self which accompany them and concur in their production hence the knowledge i have of other spirit be not immediate as be the knowledge of my ideas but depend on the intervention of ideas by me refer to agents or spirit distinct from my self as effect or concomitant sign but though there be some things which convince us humane agents be concern in produce them yet it be evident to every one that those things which be call the work of nature that be the far greater part of the ideas or sensations perceive by us be not produce by or dependent on the will of men there be therefore some other spirit that cause them since it be repugnant that they should subsist by themselves see sect but if we attentively consider the constant regularity order and concatenation of natural things the surprise magnificence beauty and perfection of the larger and the exquisite contrivance of the smaller part of creation together with the exact harmony and correspondence of the whole but above all the never enough admire laws of pain and pleasure and the instincts or natural inclinations appetites and passions of animals i say if we consider all these things and at the same time attend to the mean and import of the attribute one eternal infinitely wise good and perfect we shall clearly perceive that they belong to the aforesaid spirit who work all in all and by whom all things consist hence it be evident that god be know as certainly and immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever distinct from our selves we may even assert that the existence of god be far more evidently perceive than the existence of men because the effect of nature be infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribe to humane agents there be not any one mark that denote a man or effect produce by him which doth not more strongly evince the be of that spirit who be the author of nature for it be evident that in affect other persons the will of man hath no other object than barely the motion of the limbs of his body but that such a motion should be attend by or excite any idea in the mind of another depend wholly on the will of the creator he alone it be who uphold all things by the word of his power maintain that intercourse between spirit whereby they be able to perceive the existence of each other and yet this pure and clear light which enlighten every one be it self invisible it seem to be a general pretence of the unthinking herd that they can not see god could we but see him say they as we see a man we should believe that he be and believe obey his command but alas we need only open our eye to see the sovereign lord of all things with a more full and clear view than we do any one of our fellowcreatures not that i imagine we see god as some will have it by a direct and immediate view or see corporeal things not by themselves but by see that which represent them in the essence of god which doctrine be i must confess to me incomprehensible but i shall explain my mean a humane spirit or person be not perceive by sense as not be an idea when therefore we see the colour size figure and motion of a man we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excite in our own mind and these be exhibit to our view in sundry distinct collections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and create spirit like our selves hence it be plain we do not see a man if by man be mean that which live move perceive and think as we do but only such a certain collection of ideas as direct us to think there be a distinct principle of think and motion like to our selves accompany and represent by it and after the same manner we see god all the difference be that whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denote a particular humane mind whithersoever we direct our view we do at all time and in all place perceive manifest tokens of the divinity every thing we see hear feel or any wise perceive by sense be a sign or effect of the power of god as be our perception of those very motion which be produce by men it be therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that be capable of the least reflexion than the existence of god or a spirit who be intimately present to our mind produce in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and intire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our be that the discovery of this great truth which lie so near and obvious to the mind should be attain to by the reason of so very few be a sad instance of the stupidity and inattention of men who though they be surround with such clear manifestations of the deity be yet so little affect by them that they seem as it be blind with excess of light but you will say hath nature no share in the production of natural things and must they be all ascribe to the immediate and sole operation of god i answer if by nature be mean only the visible series of effect or sensations imprint on our mind accord to certain fix and general laws then it be plain that nature take in this sense can not produce any thing at all but if by nature be mean some be distinct from god as well as from the laws of nature and things perceive by sense i must confess that word be to me an empty sound without any intelligible mean annex to it nature in this acceptation be a vain chimera introduce by those heathens who have not just notions of the omnipresence and infinite perfection of god but it be more unaccountable that it should be receive among christians profess belief in the holy scriptures which constantly ascribe those effect to the immediate hand of god that heathen philosophers be wont to impute to nature the lord he causeth the vapours to ascend he maketh lightnings with rain he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasure jerem chap ver he turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night amos chap ver he visiteth the earth and maketh it soft with shower he blesseth the spring thereof and crowneth the year with his goodness so that the pasture be clothe with flock and the valleys be cover over with corn see psalm but notwithstanding that this be the constant language of scripture yet we have i know not what aversion from believe that god concern himself so nearly in our affairs fain would we suppose him at a great distance off and substitute some blind unthinking deputy in his stead though if we may believe saint paul he be not far from every one of us it will i doubt not be object that the slow and gradual methods observe in the production of natural things do not seem to have for their cause the immediate hand of an almighty agent besides monsters untimely birth fruit blast in the blossom rain fall in desert place miseries incident to humane life be so many arguments that the whole frame of nature be not immediately actuate and superintend by a spirit of infinite wisdom and goodness but the answer to this objection be in a good measure plain from sect it be visible that the aforesaid methods of nature be absolutely necessary in order to work by the most simple and general rule and after a steady and consistent manner which argue both the wisdom and goodness of god such be the artificial contrivance of this mighty machine of nature that whilst its motion and various phænomena strike on our sense the hand which actuate the whole be it self unperceivable to men of flesh and blood verily saith the prophet thou art a god that hidest thy self isaiah chap ver but though god conceal himself from the eye of the sensual and lazy who will not be at the least expense of think yet to an unbiassed and attentive mind nothing can be more plainly legible than the intimate presence of an allwise spirit who fashion regulate and sustain the whole systeme of be it be clear from what we have elsewhere observe that the operate accord to general and state laws be so necessary for our guidance in the affairs of life and let us into the secret of nature that without it all reach and compass of think all humane sagacity and design could serve to no manner of purpose it be even impossible there should be any such faculties or power in the mind see sect which one consideration abundantly outbalance whatever particular inconvenience may thence arise we should further consider that the very blemish and defect of nature be not without their use in that they make an agreeable sort of variety and augment the beauty of the rest of the creation as shade in a picture serve to set off the brighter and more enlighten part we would likewise do well to examine whether our tax the waste of seed and embryos and accidental destruction of plant and animals before they come to full maturity as an imprudence in the author of nature be not the effect of prejudice contract by our familiarity with impotent and save mortals in man indeed a thrifty management of those things which he can not procure without much pain and industry may be esteem wisdom but we must not imagine that the inexplicably fine machine of an animal or vegetable cost the great creator any more pain or trouble in its production than a pebble doth nothing be more evident than that an omnipotent spirit can indifferently produce every thing by a mere fiat or act of his will hence it be plain that the splendid profusion of natural things should not be interpret weakness or prodigality in the agent who produce them but rather be look on as an argument of the riches of his power as for the mixture of pain or uneasiness which be in the world pursuant to the general laws of nature and the action of finite imperfect spirit this in the state we be in at present be indispensably necessary to our wellbeing but our prospect be too narrow we take for instance the idea of some one particular pain into our thoughts and account it evil whereas if we enlarge our view so as to comprehend the various end connexions and dependencies of things on what occasion and in what proportion we be affect with pain and pleasure the nature of humane freedom and the design with which we be put into the world we shall be force to acknowledge that those particular things which consider in themselves appear to be evil have the nature of good when consider as link with the whole systeme of be from what hath be say it will be manifest to any consider person that it be merely for want of attention and comprehensiveness of mind that there be any favourers of atheism or the manichean heresy to be find little and unreflecting souls may indeed burlesque the work of providence the beauty and order whereof they have not capacity or will not be at the pain to comprehend but those who be master of any justness and extent of think and be withal use to reflect can never sufficiently admire the divine trace of wisdom and goodness that shine throughout the oeconomy of nature but what truth be there which shineth so strongly on the mind that by an aversion of think a wilful shut of the eye we may not escape see it be it therefore to be wonder at if the generality of men who be ever intent on business or pleasure and little use to fix or open the eye of their mind should not have all that conviction and evidence of the be of god which might be expect in reasonable creatures we should rather wonder that men can be find so stupid as to neglect than that neglect they should be unconvinced of such an evident and momentous truth and yet it be to be fear that too many of part and leisure who live in christian countries be merely through a supine and dreadful negligence sink into a sort of atheism since it be downright impossible that a soul pierce and enlighten with a thorough sense of the omnipresence holiness and justice of that almighty spirit should persist in a remorseless violation of his laws we ought therefore earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important point that so we may attain conviction without all scruple that the eye of the lord be in every place behold the evil and the good that he be with us and keepeth us in all place whither we go and giveth us bread to eat and raiment to put on that he be present and conscious to our innermost thoughts and that we have a most absolute and immediate dependence on him a clear view of which great truths can not choose but fill our hearts with an awful circumspection and holy fear which be the strongest incentive to virtue and the best guard against vice for after all what deserve the first place in our study be the consideration of god and our duty which to promote as it be the main drift and design of my labour so shall i esteem them altogether useless and ineffectual if by what i have say i can not inspire my readers with a pious sense of the presence of god and have shew the falseness or vanity of those barren speculations which make the chief employment of learn men the better dispose them to reverence and embrace the salutary truths of the gospel which to know and to practice be the highest perfection of humane nature
